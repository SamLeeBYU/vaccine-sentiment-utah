# Utah Vaccine Rhetoric

**Authors:** Sam Lee, Hannah Schoentrup, and Myriam Christensen  

## Research Question
How has media rhetoric and sentiment surrounding vaccines in Utah evolved since the onset of COVID-19?

## Summary
This project analyzes vaccine-related coverage from two major Utah news outlets—**Deseret News** and **KSL**—from 2017 to 2024. Using a large-scale scraping pipeline, we extract, clean, and classify articles containing vaccine-related keywords. Sentiment and rhetorical framing are quantified with Google’s **Gemma** language model, and temporal patterns are evaluated using a model-based Bayesian Interrupted Time Series (ITS) framework. We identify structural shifts in vaccine discourse before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

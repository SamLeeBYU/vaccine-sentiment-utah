“It’s really a unique collection,” said Eric Bradley, head of public relations for Heritage Auctions, which is handling the sale.
Items from the first four decades of the religious black separatist movement, founded in 1930, will go on the auction block in Dallas on Thursday, but bidders from around the world may compete online.
The auction is divided into three lots: the ring, the hat and the documents — 29 boxes’ worth that include sermon notes and lesson plans.
The opening bid on Muhammad’s 14 karat gold ring — bearing the Nation of Islam star-and-crescent symbol and encrusted with 11 diamonds — is $1,000, Bradley said. Bids on the kofia start at $10,000, but it could go for double. And the minimum on the documents is $250,000.
The auction items belong to the family of Burnsteen Sharrieff Muhammad, who served as secretary for Nation of Islam co-founder W.D. Fard, who led the group until 1934.
Bradley said the family was trying to decide what to do with the items and documents, and concluded that “now is a good time,” to sell them, he said.
The Nation of Islam today is far smaller than the mid-20th-century organization that attracted thousands of African-Americans with its message of self-sufficiency and piety, its mistrust of the white establishment and its call for black separatism.
Then the dominant stream of Islam in America, it no longer is. Today, most mainstream adherents of Islam in the U.S. and abroad consider many of the Nation of Islam’s beliefs heretical.
The Nation of Islam’s two most famous converts, boxer Muhammad Ali and civil rights leader Malcolm X, both eventually broke with the organization.
Its prominence grew somewhat in the mid-1990s, especially after its sponsorship of the Million Man March in Washington, D.C., in 1995. The Nation of Islam’s current leader, Louis Farrakhan, 83, is considered controversial for his anti-Semitic and homophobic sermons, his claims to have visited outer space, and false assertions that vaccines cause autism and that 9/11 “was an inside job.”",2017-05-10T00:55:00Z,2017,2,1

That also means I come face to face with thousands of germs and illnesses everyday. Whether they are severe illnesses or not, it is a big problem.
The amount of children and adults not being vaccinated is a huge setback and is on the rise. In 1997, a false study was published about a theory that vaccinations are the main cause of autism and many people believed it. A few years later, the article was found to have had the results tampered with and lied about to get money. The article was discredited and the author lost his medical license. Though it was disproved, rumors still continued to spread and more people believed. No one knows the exact cause of autism, but there has never been a medical correlation to autism and vaccinations.
Before parents decide their child’s medical future, they should consult with a doctor, rather than their neighbor or cousin. David Katz of Yale University said, “It is no more sense to rant about vaccines because you know someone ... than to stop walking because you heard about a pedestrian struck by a car.""

https://www.deseret.com/2017/8/24/20618176/two-human-cases-of-west-nile-virus-reported-in-utah/,Two human cases of West Nile virus reported in Utah,Deseret News,2017-08-24T21:42:51Z,"SALT LAKE CITY — State health officials have been tracking West Nile virus since the first human case was detected in Utah in 2003.
The Utah Department of Health confirmed Thursday that two human cases have been reported in Salt Lake County, and one horse is infected in Carbon County.
The mosquito-borne illness is transmitted by the noxious bugs who have bit an infected bird. In addition to humans, the virus can be found in wild birds, horses and sentinel chickens — at least those are the species the state typically follows.
At least 67 infected mosquito populations have been found throughout the state — in Salt Lake, Davis, Utah, Box Elder, Cache, Duchesne, Millard, Uintah and Weber counties, according to the health department.
The agency asks residents to protect themselves from mosquito bites whenever spending time outdoors. The infection can be deadly for horses, but a vaccine exists to protect them from illness.
Not all mosquitoes carry the virus, but those that do tend to be out from dusk to dawn, according to health department epidemiologist Keegan McCaffrey.
""There is no vaccine for humans, so taking simple precautions to avoid mosquito bites is the key to reducing your risk for infection,"" he said. McCaffrey encourages use of mosquito repellents containing DEET, picaridin or oil of lemon eucalyptus. He said repellents with up 30 percent DEET are safe for anyone older than 2 months.
He also said people should wear long-sleeved shirts and pants while outdoors.
Both cases of West Nile virus contracted in Utah were people age 40 to 64 and both developed a fever, but they steered clear of more serious and neuroinvasive symptoms of meningitis and encephalitis, according to health department statistics.
Since West Nile virus was first detected in Utah, 2006 has been the most active season, resulting in five human deaths. Last year, the illness infected 13 people and seven horses, and one person over age 65 died from the symptoms.
Nationally, more than 1,600 people were infected with the West Nile virus last year, resulting in 84 deaths, according to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
While most people infected by the virus won't notice any symptoms, they can include flu-like symptoms such as fever and body aches, or worse, according to the health department. Symptoms can develop within three and 15 days after a bite from an infected mosquito, and sickness can last a few days to weeks.
More severe cases include high fever, headache and stiff neck, disorientation and confusion. People at highest risk of serious infection include those age 50 and older, and people with compromised immune systems.
Though protection from infection is important for everyone, said state health educator Becky Ward.
""While many people who get West Nile virus don't have neuroinvasive disease, it can occur and can result in death,"" she said.
The department will continue virus surveillance into the fall. For more information, visit health.utah.gov/wnv.
While mosquito abatement districts have been busy trying to manage mosquito populations, homeowners are asked to help.
Mosquitoes breed in standing water, so removing puddles or buckets, even birdbaths and plant containers, where water can pool, is imperative to control populations of the unpleasant insects.",2017-08-24T21:42:51Z,2017,3,1

America is a major producer again, and abundant natural gas and breakthroughs in wind and solar power promise to keep energy inexpensive.
China has mapped ambitious plans to replace the internal combustion engine but it won’t take a socialist edict to bring electric cars here. Free-market economics will require that those replace gasoline-powered vehicles in personal transportation and many commercial uses. That will profoundly reduce U.S. petroleum use and carbon footprint and make America a major net energy exporter.
Capital to improve and start businesses is significantly less expensive than before the financial crisis. America’s private sector — more defined by technology giants like Google and Apple and innovations in digital innovation — requires fewer funds to create more new and better products than it did during the industrial age.
Google was started with only $25 million and was worth $23 billion five years later. Henry Ford needed far more money and time to launch the Model T.
That’s why large corporations have more profits than they can reinvest, the Federal Reserve predicts that interest rates will not again rise to pre-financial crisis levels and most importantly, anyone with a good idea can raise the funds needed to launch a Twitter or an Airbnb.
Finally, the high cost of labor, which has been a major impediment to U.S.-based production, is about to become irrelevant as robotics and artificial intelligence automate so much of what we do.
Labor-saving innovations inevitably spark new growth and employment opportunities, but the challenge remains to train many more young people and displaced workers for more highly skilled positions. Progress in medicine and neurotechnology offers a glimpse of radically improved human capability for more genuinely creative work and multitasking.
Over the last 200 years, medicine has gone from trial and error identification of roots and herbs to cope with ailments to more scientific inquiry to develop vaccines, antibiotics and reconstructive devices to mapping and leveraging the genetic codes to create treatments.
Recently, Novartis AG received approval from the FDA for a first of its kind procedure to alter the DNA of a patient’s white blood cells to combat an aggressive form of leukemia. Essentially, having mapped the genetic instructions embedded in the human machine, we are now recoding its software.
Neurotechnology connects the human brain to mechanical devices. Until now, its practical applications have focused on compensating for nerve damage — implanting devices that permit patients with severed spinal cords to use their legs — and on correcting brain disorders — treating epilepsy by repairing defects in the electronic signals the brain sends to the rest of the body.
Now it is branching into a formal union of computers and the brain to improve cognitive performance and enhance the thinking power of the human mind — put more plainly, altering the species by adding new accessories.
DARPA and Facebook are working on a brain interface that would eliminate the need for keyboards or speaking through digital assistants to instruct our laptops and smartphones. This would permit humans, simply by thinking, to access the resources of the internet in real time and delegate complex tasks to artificial intelligence programs — the brain will go from violinist to conductor of a full-scale orchestra.
DARPA is working on a neural interface much larger than used, for example, to treat epilepsy and similar disorders that would transform the brain into a programmable and improvable machine. Teaching new skills could become something akin to the scene in “The Matrix” where a character learns kung fu from a download.
The potential to open doors for ordinary and disadvantaged citizens to sophisticated and creative pursuits in finance, medicine, law, engineering, the arts and more are breathtaking and harken a new age — as profound as the Enlightenment.
About 130,000 years ago, modern man emerged and has not changed much — the species, unlike others could create tools and structures to alter its environment instead of adapting physically to changing conditions.
A new age dawns. The species will alter the human brain to accomplish more productive and satisfying lives.

Nearly every part of the continental U.S. has been affected.
Influenza, or the flu, is a contagious viral illness that can cause headaches, fever, chills, fatigue, coughing, runny nose and sore throat, according to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.
And if you are one of the lucky ones who haven't been sidelined by the flu, here are a few tips from the CDC, the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, Healthline, The New York Times, ABC News and other sources to keep you healthy until this especially bad sick season passes:
• Get a flu shot every year. The CDC says getting vaccinated is the most important step to avoiding the flu, and everyone older than 6 months should get the shot. Those at high risk, such as children, people over 65 years old, those with health complications and who work or live in nursing homes have a higher need to get the vaccine.
• Cough and sneeze into your elbow to avoid the spread of germs. Health.ny.gov suggests covering your nose with a tissue when you sneeze. The flu is spread through moisture droplets, which can end up in the air or on your hands after you sneeze or talk.
• Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Germs are spread when people touch an infected surface and then transfer those germs to the face where they can enter through the eyes, nose and mouth. Therefore, frequent hand washing also helps to decrease your chances of getting sick.
• Keep your immune system healthy. Eating a nutritious diet, staying hydrated, exercising, getting enough sleep and frequent hand washing all contribute to a healthy immune system.
• Disinfect surfaces. Use a disinfectant cleaner or a bleach solution to kill flu germs on commonly touched surfaces rather than just moving germs around with soap and water, the New York State Department of Health says. Flu germs can live for two to eight hours on hard surfaces. Remote controls and phones are commonly touched objects that are rarely cleaned and can host flu germs.
• Avoid crowded places, if possible, and close contact with those who have the flu. Even doctor’s offices, often crowded with sick patients, should be avoided unless you have a serious case of the flu. The CDC advises that people sick with the flu stay home until symptoms are gone for 24 hours.",2018-01-24T14:20:27Z,2018,1,2

What’s going on: Researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas have developed a vaccine that could protect the brain against Alzheimer’s disease.
- “This study is the culmination of a decade of research that has repeatedly demonstrated that this vaccine can effectively and safely target in animal models what we think may cause Alzheimer’s disease,” said Dr. Roger Rosenberg, founding Director of the Alzheimer’s Disease Center at the university, in a news release.
- According to USA Today, the vaccine, which prevents the buildup of harmful proteins linked to the disease, has shown positive results in mice, rabbits and monkeys so far.
- Newsweek reported that researchers are hoping to move it to human trials soon.
- If the vaccine proves safe and effective during human trials, it could cut the number of dementia cases in half, the study's senior author told USA Today.
Alzheimer’s is a degenerative disease that destroys neurons and causes the brain to deteriorate. According to the news release, approximately 5.7 million Americans have Alzheimer's. That number could double to 11.4 million by 2050.

How it works: According to Forbes, the vaccine uses DNA from Alzheimer's proteins to teach the body’s immune system to fight against these compounds and stop them from accumulating in the brain.
- Since researchers don’t know when the proteins form, physicians would conduct PET brain scans to determine when to give patients the vaccine, Forbes reported.
- KSAT reported that the vaccine is injected into the skin as opposed to the muscle. A previous experimental AD vaccine caused brain swelling after it was injected into the muscles of patients.",2018-11-26T20:51:47Z,2018,4,2
https://www.deseret.com/2018/7/5/20648411/when-a-child-is-traumatized-this-one-thing-helps-their-recovery-the-most/,"When a child is traumatized, this one thing helps their recovery the most",Deseret News,2018-07-05T13:25:48Z,"SALT LAKE CITY — Long after they've stopped crying, children separated from their parents at the southern border of the U.S. could suffer long-lasting consequences of trauma, including addiction, disease and possibly dementia.
So could your children, if they’ve been affected by more common adverse events, such as substance abuse, divorce or a serious illness that incapacitates a parent.
For the past 20 years, researchers have learned that ""what happens in childhood doesn't stay in childhood,"" as the authors of a new book published by the American Academy of Pediatrics say.
“The way the body adapts to ongoing stress is useful in the short term, but can be really damaging in the long term,” said Dr. Andrew Garner, who with Dr. Robert A. Saul, wrote “Thinking Developmentally.""
But this doesn't mean all children who endure traumatic circumstances will be damaged adults.
""No matter what kind of adversity you look at, most of us will ultimately be resilient,"" said Megan Gunnar, director of the Institute of Child Development at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.
Research into neuroplasticity — the brain's ability to adapt throughout life — has shown that long-established habits of thinking and behavior can be changed. And Gunnar suspects there's a specific window during which the brain of a child traumatized early in life might recalibrate how it responds to toxic stress: puberty, the time of significant hormonal change.
But the most important factor in how a child overcomes trauma is the consistent presence of a stable and nurturing parent, which is why the United States' policy of separating children from detained migrant parents has child-development experts so upset.
Border agents separated more than 2,000 children — some as young as 3 years old — from their parents or caregivers between April and June 20, when President Donald Trump signed an order rescinding that part of his ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy; about 500 had been reunited as of June 30.
Biology of attachment
Newborns don’t recognize their parents right away, but around the time they start crawling, they have a desperate desire to be with their parents, as any parent who’s tried to leave a toddler with a babysitter knows.
That attachment occurs in all primates and exists for good cause: to ensure that the child stays close to the people most invested in keeping her alive.
“We’ve evolved so that these systems get really revved up about the time we could walk away from our parent,” Gunnar said. “At around 7, 8 or 9 months, the baby begins to say, ‘I don’t care if my babysitter reads the story better than anyone else. I want you reading the story because you are the person I’ve formed this incredible bond with. That is their safe place.”
So long as the parent is near or accessible, the child can quickly recover from a stressful event, such as getting vaccinations.
“You can go to the doctor with a 15-month-old, and they’ll get shots in both legs and they’re going to scream their heads off, but if your relationship with the child is secure and you’re there and available, if I measure it, you won’t see much of a stress response at all. They’ll cry, but the body won’t kick in this defensive hormonal system. And we’ve recently discovered that this lasts until puberty,” Gunnar said.
For older children and adolescents, a mother who has a strong bond with her child doesn’t even have to be present every moment to mitigate the effects of a mildly stressful event. In one study in which children had to give a speech in front of other people (“one of the best stressors we know that we can do ethically,"" Gunnar said), being able to talk to the parent after the speech, even only on the phone, enabled the children’s stress levels to quickly return to normal.
Short-term stress, whether a vaccination or a speech, can be good for a child, said Garner, clinical professor of pediatrics at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.
“Some adversities can be positive, in the sense that the stress response is brief, usually because there’s a nurturing relationship there to help the child turn off the stress response. That can actually help build resilience for the future,” he said.
When the parent is missing for a longer period, however, “we’re removing the primary source of stress regulation,” Gunnar said.
“And the very removal of that parent is another stressor. We’re kicking in all the biology that will potentially change the way the brain functions,” she said.
Why toxic stress endures
Dr. Vincent J. Felitti, an internal medicine doctor, is widely acknowledged as the first person to show the link between early trauma and poor outcomes later in life.
Felitti was supervising obese people on a liquid diet in the 1980s when he discovered that one of his patients, a woman who had lost more than 100 pounds but regained 37 pounds in three weeks, had been sexually abused as a child.
""In short order, it became clear that obesity was not her problem, it was her solution to problems we knew nothing about,"" Felitti said.
After he learned another woman he was treating also had a history of sexual abuse, Felitti began interviewing others in the program and learned that more than half of 186 patients had a history of sexual abuse. Additional surveys by other physicians replicated the findings.
The discovery led to a long-term study of more than 17,000 people that is known as the ""ACE Study"" — ACE is an acronym for adverse childhood experiences.
Participants were asked if they had experienced any of 10 types of adversity in childhood in three categories: household dysfunction, abuse or neglect. Felitti and his co-investigator were flabbergasted by the results. Although the subjects were largely well-educated and middle-class, two-thirds reported experiencing at least one of the adverse events, and 87 percent reported two or more.
Those with the most adverse experiences in childhood had the greatest number of physical and mental problems later in life.
Now retired from clinical practice and living in San Diego, Felitti said there are three reasons childhood trauma shows up as biomedical disease a half-century later.
The first is that people with unresolved trauma employ coping mechanisms as adults, “all of which have distinct short-term benefits but many of which have major long-term detriments,” Felitti said. These coping mechanisms include overeating and drug and alcohol addiction, all of which are major factors in disease.
Secondly, early trauma seems to dampen immune function and keep the body in a constant state of inflammation.
“It’s been discovered in the past decade, that under conditions of chronic, major, unrelieved stress, such as adverse childhood experiences, there is chronic hyperstimulation of multiple areas of the brain, one of which is involved in immune system function,” Felitti said.
Gunnar, at the University of Minnesota, noted that in one animal study, baby monkeys who were taken from their mothers, had weakened immune systems for the rest of their lives even though they were returned to their mother after two weeks and then lived in normal conditions.
The third factor Felitti described is epigenetics, the study of how a person’s environment and experiences can affect the functioning of genes.
When we are repeatedly exposed to stress, a process called DNA methylation occurs, changing how the gene works. When the brain is always on high alert, preparing for the next onslaught of stress, a gene's “on-off” switch can get stuck on “on"" as a defensive mechanism, and researchers believe this effect can pass to another generation.
The field of epigenetics was new when Felitti and his co-investigators began their research so they did not consider epigenetic effects in the ACE Study, which ended two years ago after 20 years of followup study of more than 17,000 people originally enrolled.
What are the solutions?
When Felitti first presented his theory, at a gathering of the North American Association for the Study of Obesity in 1990, he was met with criticism from some people who said his patients must have been making up stories about past abuse to cover for their “failed lives.”
However, when the physician, who was chief of Kaiser Permanente’s Department of Preventive Medicine, partnered with researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and studied more than 17,000 people for 20 years, his findings were hard to refute.
Since then, hundreds of other studies have been done on the biological effects of childhood trauma and confirmed Felitti’s theory, including one report published earlier this year that suggests a connection between early trauma and dementia in rats may translate to humans.
Although it's not been proven, Felitti believes the mere act of talking about trauma can help reduce some of its effects.
He said outcomes could be improved if physicians know not just how patients are sick, but why they are sick, and that patient health surveys should ask about adverse events.
Any effort to incorporate discussion of past trauma into routine doctor visits is difficult because of liability and privacy issues, as well as what Felitti describes as the resistance of non-psychiatrists to delve into psychiatry. But there are other, simpler things that Americans can do to help heal the wounds of traumatized children.
In Minneapolis, Gunnar has been studying children who were unable to form stable relationship early in life, such as children adopted from orphanages. She believes that hormonal changes might open up a window for the brain to recalibrate its response to stress if the child's later environment is supportive and non-threatening.
The most important thing, Gunnar said, is to ensure the child has a secure, lasting relationship with a parent or caregiver who is consistent and supportive.
""That relationship piece is the core critical thing,"" she said.
Garner, in Cleveland, believes that in the case of the migrant children separated from their parents, rebuilding that bond is the most important task, even though it may be difficult because the children, depending on their age, may be angry and oppositional with the parent.
""The relationship is the foundation for how we build resiliency, how we learn things. We learn things in the context of relationships,"" he said.
Another way to help ramp down the biological response to stress is to quickly re-establish routines.
“Routines make the world predictable and safe, so kids know what’s going to happen. That also decreases the stress response,” Garner said.
Once the primary relationship is strong and routines are established, the parent or caregiver can help the child learn that there is nothing wrong with negative emotions like fear or anger, but that there are positive ways of dealing with them, such as immersing themselves in something they enjoy, such as drawing, reading, playing an instrument or taking part in a sport.
“If we can channel that energy into something constructive, now we’re really cooking with gas,” Garner said.
Garner’s new book ""Thinking Developmentally"" cites a study about the effect of physically stroking infants whose mothers were experiencing postpartum depression, thus putting the babies at risk for epigenetic changes. Infants who were stroked by their mothers 5 and 9 weeks after birth had fewer epigenetic changes, offering more evidence of the importance of touch and supportive parenting, which Felitti believes many American children don’t get.
He remembers being skeptical about a report he heard a decade ago about the importance of making eye-to-eye contact with newborns. But when he tried it with his grandchild, he was astonished at the effect it had on the baby, and said that small things, such as speaking to newborns regularly, help create the bond that will help the child be resilient if trauma later occurs.",2018-07-05T13:25:48Z,2018,3,2
https://www.deseret.com/2018/1/4/20637848/influenza-virus-reaching-widespread-proportions-in-utah/,Influenza virus reaching widespread proportions in Utah,Deseret News,2018-01-05T01:16:47Z,"SALT LAKE CITY — It's that time of the year again.
Kids are sniffling, co-workers are coughing and people are suffering. Sleep is harder to get, and drugstore shelves where pain medication and decongestants can be found are emptying.
Influenza is on the rise, and just as in recent years, the illness has fast become widespread in the state, according to the Utah Department of Health.
""If you haven't gotten your influenza vaccine, you should get it,"" said Gregg Reed, a health department epidemiologist. ""It not only helps yourself, but helps those around you. It helps stop the spread of disease in your community.""
And while immunization experts try to predict exactly which strains of the flu will be circulating in the coming year, sometimes the vaccine falls short.
But some protection is still better than no protection, Reed said.
This year's vaccine is believed to be anywhere from 30 percent to 60 percent effective, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, though strains are circulating and often mutate after vaccinations are disseminated.
Flu symptoms — including fever, cough and/or sore throat, and body aches and pains — come on quickly and strong, said Reed. Common cold symptoms are similar, though less severe, and the two can sometimes only be differentiated by a doctor.
""Influenza really hits you like a ton of bricks,"" Reed said, adding that the flu ""causes substantial illness"" throughout the state every year.
Already, more than 400 Utahns have been hospitalized due to the disease this flu season, including men, women and children. The majority are older than age 65, but a large number of adults have ended up in the hospital with influenza symptoms, according to the state health department's latest weekly report on the disease.
The illness can be more severe for the elderly, children and people whose immune systems are compromised, Reed said.
While Utahns may have died with influenza-associated illnesses this year, deaths related to the disease are not officially tracked and reported through the health department, as it is difficult to determine whether influenza causes a person to die. It is often a contributing factor, according to CDC mortality surveillance.
Some states are reporting a higher number of flu-related deaths compared with previous years, and many are spiking since the beginning of the year, according to the Associated Press, but Utah cases are increasing at a rate similar to last year.
In Utah, the highest number of cases is reported in Salt Lake County, but every area of the state is experiencing influenza-like illnesses, the health department data show.
The Bear River and Davis County health districts reported the highest levels of activity, as of Dec. 30, but Reed said more areas are showing increased signs of the spread of disease and he expects the next report to reflect that.
CDC reports show that at least 36 states are showing widespread influenza activity and the predominant strain across the nation is Influenza A, the H3 subtype that was first detected in 2011. Disease activity is listed as ""regional"" in Utah according to the latest map, but that will change as it is spreading more rapidly, Reed said.
""We expect it to increase, and we need to take preventive action to prevent additional illness,"" he said.
Utahns can monitor circulating illnesses using Intermountain Healthcare's GermWatch, which tracks current activity levels of disease in the state. Influenza is listed as having high activity throughout Utah, as well as other respiratory illnesses.
In addition to the flu shot, another line of defense for influenza is antiviral medication. It can be obtained from a doctor and must be taken soon after symptoms appear. If influenza is suspected, antiviral use, much like the vaccine, can shorten the duration and severity of illness.
""It's not a substitute for getting the vaccine, but can treat the flu,"" Reed said.
The influenza season began Oct. 1 and could stretch into May. It typically peaks in late February or March.
Rich Lakin, state health department immunization program manager, said a lot of people are getting flu shots despite the rumors that it might not be 100 percent effective.
The Non family had appointments to be immunized Thursday at Salt Lake County Health Department's South Main Street clinic, hoping to avoid any complications associated with the disease.
""It's still better than nothing,"" Lakin said. ""It is very beneficial to get the flu vaccine.""",2018-01-05T01:16:47Z,2018,1,2

Taylorsville home condemned after up to 125 dogs found living inside,Deseret News,2018-08-24T16:11:10Z,"TAYLORSVILLE — Based on the smell coming from the house and the appearance of the front yard, animal control officers expected to find a handful of dogs.
""As the code enforcement people are knocking on the door and chatting with the lady, they figured there would be five to seven dogs based on what they were smelling and seeing. And we ended up taking 60 dogs last night and another 50 to 60 still there,” Taylorsville City Attorney Tracy Cowdell said Friday.
On Friday, West Valley Animal Services, Unified fire crews, Salt Lake County Heath Department representatives and officials from the city of Taylorsville continued to clean out a house where more than 100 and as many as 125 dogs had been living.
West Valley Animal Services director David Moss said 68 dogs were pulled out of the house Thursday night before the operation was called off due to darkness. Another 50 or more were expected to be removed Friday. More than 100 of the dogs are Chihuahuas, while others are also smaller breeds like terriers.
The bizarre investigation began about 5 p.m. Thursday when code enforcement officers and animal control officers went to 5705 S. Easton. Cowdell said there had been code enforcement issues concerning the home's yard in the past, but the couple who lives there had always been cooperative about fixing the issues.
This time, crews went to the house on a report of a foul smell. Cowdell said neighbors had been complaining ""for the last little while,"" but officials were still searching Friday for when the first formal complaints were filed with the city. Some neighbors claimed they have been complaining for more than a year, but it was unclear if they actually reported their concerns to authorities.
Cowdell said Taylorsville has no complaints on record for the past several months.
""We don’t have a track record really, for this kind of thing,” he said.
Unified Police Sgt. Melody Gray said the stench stretched down the street, but it's unclear if anyone ever bothered to call police.
Looking at the outside of the property, Cowdell said he would never have guessed that between 115 and 125 dogs were living in the house.
""It’s just shocking, you really couldn’t tell there were (so many) dogs in there,” he said.
A couple who are believed to be in their late 70s lives in the house. Cowdell described them as ""very reclusive people"" who never let anyone else inside their home. One neighbor said she had never met the couple.
The couple claimed they wanted to help stray dogs, but that they became overwhelmed by the number of dogs living in their home and couldn't keep up with the caretaking of animals, including the removal of feces.
""They kind of fancied themselves as people who cared for stray animals, taking care of dogs. They kind of viewed themselves as humanitarians,” Cowdell said.
The dogs reportedly lived indoors all the time. Officials believe the Chihuahuas were also reproducing inside the house.
Cowdell said the couple has been cooperating with officials, and they are appreciative of the help.
""They knew it was beyond their ability to manage it at this point,” he said.
Moss said most of the dogs taken from the house were surprisingly in good shape and will be able to be adopted after receiving vaccinations. Some, however, were in ""not so great"" shape, he said.
The house itself was not in great shape. It was condemned by health officials shortly after police arrived because of deplorable conditions inside. Officials wearing full hazardous materials suits could be seen going inside, checking for dangerous gases.
Once the dogs are given a clean bill of health, they can be adopted beginning in about five days.",2018-08-24T16:11:10Z,2018,3,2

Shayla Pittenger and Olivia McInerny had one last item to tick off their checklist before they headed to the Salt Lake City International Airport Tuesday afternoon to fly home to California for the Christmas break. So, they stopped in at the Joseph Smith Memorial Building next to Temple Square and bought fowls from a vending machine.
""This was our mom's Christmas dream, to come to the machines and buy two chickens,"" Pittenger said.
Shoppers are donating money for cows, polio vaccines or other items such as an ""empowerment pack for five girls"" for the needy around the world this Christmas season at #LightTheWorld vending machines sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in five locations in the United States, England and the Philippines.
The giving machines had generated 52,279 contributions worth $1,332,128 in charitable donations through Monday, church spokesman Daniel Woodruff said. That's more than double what was raised when the machines debuted last year in a single location.
Lisa Tanner lives in Huntington Beach, California, far from any of the charity vending machines. Her daughters live in Provo, so they made the stop in Salt Lake City on the way home to see her. Pittenger, 27, paid $21 while McInerny, 21, shot a video with her phone.
""It's like my mom was here,"" McInerny said. ""She'll be really happy. I came last year but the line was an hour long. This is a great thing the church does. I think these vending machines should be put everywhere.""
The #LightTheWorld machines debuted in the lobby of the Joseph Smith Memorial Building — the former Hotel Utah — during the 2017 Christmas season and raised more than $550,000 for local and international charities, according to Vending Times.
The church added four new locations this year — the church's Manhattan New York Temple site in New York City's Lincoln Square; the Water Tower Plaza in Gilbert, Arizona; the Hyde Park Chapel visitors' center in London; and the SM Mega Mall in Manila, Philippines.
Givers can purchase items ranging from $2 (fingerling fishes) to $210 (school in a box). Donating a cow costs $150. Many of the donations go to global charity partners of LDS Charities. Others go to local charities, such as those for eye exams or glasses.
The charities reserve the right to use the money donated through the vending machines for items or services of greater need.
On Tuesday afternoon, an Activity Days group from the Hillcrest Third Ward in Sandy stood in line to make donations.
""We were doing a fun Activity Days and we thought it would be fun to come here and donate stuff,"" said Nora Jackson, 8, who bought a school girl uniform. Her brother, Eli, 6, bought a baby resuscitation kit.
Their mother, Jennifer Jackson, bought a sewing machine.
""I'm a seamstress and bridal designer by trade, and I've been able to see over the years how those skills can support a family,"" she said. ""My husband lost his job a couple of times and my alterations were able to support our family. We've been really blessed this year, and I'm grateful to pass it along.""
Natalia Shepherd, 9, and Sarah Humbert, 8, also paid for baby resuscitation kits.
""I want to help babies grow and get healthy,"" Natalia said after making her purchase. ""It made me feel happy and warm because I'm helping people.""
The Activity Days leader, Arminda Shepherd, said the children used their savings to make the donations.
""I wanted to teach them that Christmastime is not all about receiving but also giving,"" she said, ""because a gift was given to us, the Son of God.""
Woodruff said some of the most popular items purchased this year include:
• Livestock/animals (goats, cows, chickens): $517,023
• Meals: $207,974
• Sewing machines: $75,465
• Water bottles: $53,150
• Polio vaccines: $35,986
""We are thrilled with the enthusiastic and generous response worldwide to the #LightTheWorld giving machines,"" Woodruff said in a written statement released Tuesday morning. ""We are truly touched by the willingness of people to follow the example of our Savior Jesus Christ and make a difference this Christmas season.""
The giving machines will remain open in each location through the end of the month.
Missionaries from the Utah Salt Lake City Mission help donors operate the machines. On Tuesday afternoon, Elder Utanda Mbambu, 22, of the Democratic Republic of Congo, joined the effort.
""People love this,"" he said. ""They know they can help people in other countries like in Africa. I am very happy to see people buy chickens and buy medicine to help others, especially refugees.""
Lines full of donors form in the late afternoons and evenings in the lobby of the Joseph Smith Memorial Building each weekday. The best time to make a donation without waiting or with a short wait is during school hours, though Christmas break begins for most Utah schools over the next couple of days.",2018-12-19T02:41:48Z,2018,4,2
https://www.deseret.com/2019/4/8/20670431/vaccines-blocked-as-deadly-cholera-raged-across-yemen/,Vaccines blocked as deadly cholera raged across Yemen,Deseret News,2019-04-08T12:32:14Z,"ADEN, Yemen — In the summer of 2017, a plane chartered by the United Nations idled on the tarmac at an airport in the Horn of Africa as officials waited for final clearance to deliver half a million doses of cholera vaccine to Yemen. Amid the country's ruinous war, the disease was spiraling out of control, with thousands of new cases reported each day.
The green light for the plane to head to northern Yemen never came. The U.N. wasn't able to distribute cholera vaccines to Yemen until May 2018 and the outbreak ultimately produced more than 1 million suspected cholera cases — the worst cholera epidemic recorded in modern times and a calamity that medical researchers say may have been avoided if vaccines had been deployed sooner.
U.N. officials blamed the canceled flight on the difficulties in distributing vaccines during an armed conflict. But officials with knowledge of the episode told The Associated Press that the real reason was that the Houthi rebels who control northern Yemen refused to allow the vaccines to be delivered, after spending months demanding that the U.N. send ambulances and other medical equipment for their military forces as a condition for accepting the shipment.
The cancellation of the shipment was just one of the setbacks that aid agencies faced in battling the cholera epidemic, which has killed nearly 3,000 Yemenis.
Relief workers and government officials said they have seen repeated indications that insiders in both the Houthi government in the north and the U.S.-backed government in the south have skimmed off money and supplies for cholera vaccination and treatment and sold them on the black market. In some cases, treatment centers for people who had contracted cholera existed only on paper even though the U.N. had disbursed money to bankroll their operations, according to two aid officials familiar with the centers.
The AP's examination of the efforts to fight the disease in Yemen drew on confidential documents and interviews with 29 people, including aid officials previously based in the country and officials from health ministries run by both the Houthi rebels and the internationally recognized government in the south. Almost all of these individuals — including six relief and health officials who say the Houthis were responsible for cancellation of the 2017 vaccine shipment — spoke on condition of anonymity because of fear of retaliation.
""Both the Houthis and the government of Yemen were trying to politicize cholera,"" an aid official told the AP.
""The Houthis are taking advantage of U.N. weakness,"" the official said. ""Corruption or aid diversion and all of this are because of the U.N.'s weak position."" Relief workers know that if the U.N. speaks out, the official said, ""their visas will be denied and they would not be allowed back in the country.""
Cholera spread across Yemen in late 2016 and throughout much of 2017 and 2018. It ebbed late last year, but has again picked up in 2019. A new surge in the disease has produced roughly 150,000 reported cholera cases and nearly 300 deaths since the start of this year. The first cholera vaccine drives in Yemen didn't start until May 2018 in the south and August 2018 in the north, aid and health officials told the AP.
Ali al-Walidi, the deputy health minister in southern Yemen, and Youssef al-Hadri, the spokesman of the Houthi-run Health Ministry in the north, both deny there were delays in getting cholera vaccines into Yemen at the start of the outbreak.
Al-Hadri said claims that the Houthis blocked the shipment of vaccines into Yemen are false.
""This is all baseless, and I challenge the agencies to say this officially,"" he said.
Geert Cappelaere, the Middle East director for UNICEF, the U.N. children's relief agency, declined to blame any particular group for halting the 2017 shipment.
""What is important is that the vaccines that needed to get in have ultimately gone in and have reached the people who needed to be vaccinated,"" he said. ""Has this been simple and easy? Absolutely not. Each shipment has been problematic to get in because of the long approval time"" and because of ""skepticism among the authorities on both sides"" about the value of cholera vaccines.

A RAVAGED LAND
More than half of Yemen's hospitals and other health facilities have been damaged or destroyed since the war began in 2015, after Houthi forces overran much of the country and Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations, with backing from the United States, launched airstrikes and imposed blockades on rebel-held territory.
The conflict has killed more than 60,000 people and much of Yemen has been on the edge of famine. An AP investigation published in December revealed that factions on all sides of Yemen's war have blocked food aid from going to groups suspected of disloyalty, diverted it to front-line combat units or sold it for profit on the black market.
More than 19 million of Yemen's 29 million people don't have access to adequate health care, and more than 17 million don't have clean water, according to the U.N. Those are prime conditions for the spread of cholera, a disease caused by feces-tainted water and food. Cholera can kill swiftly if untreated, its victims drained by diarrhea, vomiting and fever.
The first significant cholera outbreak came in late 2016, leading to more than 25,000 suspected cases and killing at least 129. Soon after, in April 2017, the disease erupted again, this time spreading at an even more furious pace. Within two months, more than 185,000 suspected cases and 1,200 deaths were reported. One local aid worker in northern Yemen recalls house after house with dying children, their small bodies racked by severe diarrhea.
When U.N. officials tried to rush in oral vaccines to halt the spread, some Houthi officials claimed vaccines were ineffective. A few circulated messages on social media asserting that vaccines could be harmful to children. Four aid officials and a former Houthi health official said that some rebel leaders suggested that the vaccination plan was a plot by the U.S. and Israel to use Yemenis as guinea pigs.
A former senior official in the Houthi Health Ministry said the concerns over the vaccines' safety were a pretext. Rebel leaders had a list of demands and tried to bargain with U.N. officials for money and equipment, he said.
During weeks of negotiations over the vaccine program, the rebels demanded that U.N. officials send X-ray machines and other items they could use to treat their wounded fighters on the front lines, according to the former health ministry official and three aid officials.
Al-Hadri, the spokesman for the Houthi-run Health Ministry, denied that Houthi authorities demanded medicine and medical equipment to be used in treating front-line soldiers. Cappelaere, UNICEF's Middle East chief, said he had no knowledge of aid officials bargaining with authorities in Yemen in the effort to import cholera vaccines.
__
THE SHIPMENT
Finally, in July 2017, U.N. officials believed they had the go-ahead to bring in cholera vaccines. Half a million doses were loaded onto a plane in the tiny African republic of Djibouti.
At the last minute, hard-liners in the Houthi-controlled Health Ministry told the U.N. they would not allow the plane to land.
Publicly, the U.N. blamed the change of plans on security and logistical challenges involved in delivering immunizations across Yemen's conflict-torn landscape. A spokesman for the U.N.'s World Health Organization said at the time that delivering vaccines ""has to make sense"" in terms of the conditions on the ground, adding that the vaccine doses intended for Yemen would likely be re-routed to places that ""might need them more urgently.""
U.N. officials sent the shipment to South Sudan in central Africa, where the disease had recently erupted. The cholera outbreak in South Sudan left 436 dead but was declared over by early 2018, largely due to the introduction of vaccines during the outbreak's early stages.
The outbreak in Yemen went on unabated.
Hager Taher, a 27-year old mother of two, was one of hundreds who died from cholera in the months after the vaccine delivery into the country had been called off. Taher was in the last days of pregnancy, living in the village of al-Ghareb, an impoverished area in the Houthi-controlled northern province of Hajjah, when she began vomiting and showing cholera-like symptoms.
The only health center in the village of nearly 1,200 people was a building with two rooms and few beds. As the number of suspected cholera cases grew, local authorities used a school to receive patients, who had to lie on the floor in the empty classrooms.
Taher was sent to a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders in the city of Abs. She soon developed complications and was moved to another hospital nearby. It was there, in September 2017, that she died. Her child was born alive but died four days later.
""It's God's will,"" her husband, Mohammed Hassan, told the AP. ""There's nothing to do.""
Taher was one of 16 people reported to have died from cholera in her district in Hajjah. Hundreds more were infected.
""The district was gulped up by cholera,"" said Ibrahim al-Masrahi, a health worker in charge of gathering epidemic surveillance reports.
By the end of 2017, the number of reported cholera cases in Yemen had surged past 1 million, with more than 2,200 deaths. The spread of the disease waned for a time, but rebounded again in the spring and summer of 2018, adding another 370,000 reported cases and 500 more deaths.
U.N. officials continued struggling to find a way to get cholera vaccines into the country.
Houthi officials held a succession of meetings throughout much of 2017 and into 2018 to consider the science and policy questions relating to vaccines. In the spring of 2018, after science panels approved bringing cholera vaccines into rebel territory, Health Minister Mohammed Salem bin Hafez gave U.N. officials the go-ahead to bring in nearly 900,000 doses of cholera vaccine, according to documents obtained by the AP.
Then two of his deputies, both of them well-connected within the Houthi leadership, said the shipment couldn't proceed, asserting that there were still more bureaucratic hurdles before the vaccines' ""safety and security"" could be assured, according to the documents.
As a non-Houthi, bin Hafez didn't have the power to overrule the decisions of the two deputies who supposedly were working under him. He wrote a letter to the prime minister of the Houthi-controlled government, Abdel-Aziz bin Habtour, detailing how the delivery of vaccines had been once again been put off.
""I am washing my hands of the consequences of these irresponsible actions,"" bin Hafez's letter said. He told the prime minister that he was ""putting the matter between your hands"" in the hope the government would ""take the necessary measures to use aid in a proper way and create proper work conditions for international and local aid agencies.""
A month later, bin Hafez left his post and fled Houthi territory.
Abdel-Aziz al-Daylami, one of the Health Ministry deputies that bin Hafez blamed for holding up the delivery of vaccines, denied that he had stopped the shipment.
""No, there was no rejection, but we had reservations,"" he told the AP. ""We thought that the vaccines would be useless"" if they were deployed without more efforts to ensure clean water and reliable sanitation systems.
""We worried that if the vaccine campaigns failed, people would turn against the use of vaccines and that would be disastrous,"" he said.

ONLY ON PAPER
As Houthi authorities debated the use of vaccines in the north, the U.N. was also working to get cholera vaccines into the country via the government in the south.
But this plan was also marred by delays — and by questions about possible corruption.
After the U.N. was able to get a shipment of vaccines into the southern city of Aden in May 2018, the Health Ministry for the U.S.- and Saudi-backed government there put together teams to raise awareness and administer the vaccines.
But some of the vaccination teams existed only on paper and many workers on the teams never received the full stipends budgeted for them under the program, two aid officials told the AP. The two officials said authorities in the south prevented aid workers from visiting the districts where immunization campaigns were taking place, making it impossible for them to monitor what was happening on the ground and verify how aid money was being used.
In the wake the vaccination campaign in the south, the Houthis broke the logjam in the north. They agreed to allow cholera vaccines into some areas under their control. Immunization drives were launched in three rebel-held districts in August and September 2018.
A senior official who worked with the Houthi-run Health Ministry at the time noted the U.N. had agreed to some of the rebels' wish list of additional medical supplies and equipment, including the purchase of 45 ambulances for the ministry. The ambulances were then sent to the front lines for the military's use, the ex-official said.
Beyond vaccine drives, concerns emerged in both the north and south about whether patients who had already contracted the disease were getting medical treatment targeted for them.
Some centers set up to treat cholera victims weren't functional even though UNICEF and the WHO had provided funding to government authorities and nongovermental groups to cover costs of setting them up and running them, according to two aid officials familiar with the centers.
One of those two aid officials said he was told there were nine cholera treatment centers in Aden. He could find only two. ""The rest didn't exist,"" he said.
Another concern in north and south was whether relief organizations were getting accurate counts of the number of people sickened with cholera in various parts of the country. Two aid officials and a former official with the Houthi-controlled Health Ministry said authorities exaggerated the number of cholera cases to increase the amount of international aid money.
A December 2018 study of the Yemen outbreak by researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that some overreporting was likely due to health workers whose livelihoods depended on money paid by the U.N. Many of the workers hadn't received their government salaries in years and believed that the cholera centers where they worked would be closed and aid money stopped if they didn't report enough suspected cases.
Still, even with overreporting, the outbreak of cholera was ""massive,"" Paul B. Spiegel, the lead author of the study and director of the university's Center for Humanitarian Health, told the AP.
Another study, published in December 2018 in the journal BMC Public Health, called the epidemic ""the largest cholera outbreak in epidemiologically recorded history.""
The report said the scale of Yemen's outbreak ""most likely"" could have been avoided or managed if enough cholera vaccines had been deployed earlier in the conflict. It added that even if a large shipment had come into the country early enough, getting the vaccine to those who needed it might not have been possible, given the ""deeply chaotic situation"" across war-torn Yemen.
More than 2.5 million doses of the cholera vaccine have been transported into Yemen by the U.N. since mid-2018. It's unclear how many of them have been administered to people in target populations. Two Houthi officials confirmed to the AP that nearly 1.2 million doses remain stored in warehouses in Sanaa, the rebels' capital. The Health Ministry there plans to distribute those doses soon in two northern districts, one of the officials said.
A senior aid official said the continuing cholera crisis remains a way for the Houthis rebels to cultivate global sympathy for their struggle against the U.S.-backed and Saudi-led coalition, whose bombing campaign has been blamed for helping to create the conditions that caused the outbreak.
""If you resolve cholera, what are the headlines?"" he said. ""They managed to control the narrative because it's easy to blame the coalition and not them and they always show up as victims.""
Al-Hadri, the spokesman for the Houthi-controlled Health Ministry in Sanaa, called that nonsense. It is international aid officials, he said, who are raking in donations and benefiting from disease and suffering inside the Middle East's poorest country.
""They are profiting from the Yemen crisis and begging in the name of Yemen,"" he said. ""They need the Yemeni crisis more than we need them.""

The order issued late Wednesday in connection with the University of California, Los Angeles, and California State University, Los Angeles, requires that affected people stay home, avoid contact with others and notify authorities if they develop measles symptoms. Los Angeles County public health officials issued quarantines of 24 to 48 hours until proof of immunity is established, according to a statement from UCLA. Some people may need to be quarantined for up to a week.
""Please be assured that we have the resources we need for prevention and treatment, and that we are working very closely with local public health officials on the matter,"" UCLA Chancellor Gene Block in the statement.
Measles in the United States has climbed to its highest level in 25 years, closing in on 700 cases this year in a resurgence largely attributed to misinformation that is turning parents against vaccines. Roughly three-quarters of this year's illnesses have been in New York state.
A UCLA student who was diagnosed with measles possibly exposed 500 people on campus to measles in early April, according to a statement from the school.
As of Thursday afternoon, 79 of those students and faculty members had not provided medical records showing that they are immune to measles, the university said.
Meanwhile at Cal State, a person infected with measles visited a library and possibly encountered hundreds of employees, some of whom were students. A total of 156 of them could not provide their immunization records as of Thursday afternoon, according to a statement from the Cal State.
Health officials determined that there is ""no known current risk related to measles at the library at this time,"" Cal State said in its statement.
The orders come as a small outbreak of measles occurs in Los Angeles County involving five confirmed cases linked to overseas travel. The state recorded 38 measles cases as of Thursday; there were 11 around the same time last year, said Dr. Karen Smith, director of the California Department of Public Health.
The state typically sees fewer than two dozen cases a year, she said.
This year, California's cases stretch across 11 counties and affect patients from 5 months old to 55.
More than 76% of patients were not vaccinated or did not receive the recommended two doses of vaccine, Smith said. Fourteen of those infected had traveled overseas to countries including Philippines, Thailand, India and Ukraine.
Measles in most people causes fever, runny nose, cough and a rash all over the body. However, a small fraction of those infected can suffer complications such as pneumonia and a dangerous swelling of the brain.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the vaccine for everyone over a year old, except for people who had the disease as children. Those who have had measles are immune.
The vaccine, which became available in the 1960s, is considered safe and effective, and because of it, measles was declared all but eliminated in the U.S. in 2000.

Cholera causes acute diarrhea, is spread by contaminated food and water and can kill within hours if not treated. The disease is a major concern for the hundreds of thousands of cyclone survivors in the southern African nation now living in squalid conditions in camps, schools or damaged homes.
The Portuguese news agency Lusa quoted Mozambique national health official Ussein Isse for the new toll. Isse declared the outbreak on Wednesday with just five confirmed cases.
Far more cholera cases already were feared. The medical charity Doctors Without Borders told The Associated Press it is seeing around 200 likely cholera cases a day in the Indian Ocean port city of Beira alone. The city of some 500,000 people is the hub of cyclone relief efforts.
The World Health Organization has warned of a ""second disaster"" if waterborne diseases like cholera spread in the impoverished nation. It said 900,000 oral cholera vaccines were expected to arrive Monday and a vaccination campaign will begin late next week.
WHO also has opened seven treatment centers with a total of 400 beds, including 100 in Beira.
""We assume that there are lots of people who will get sick and we want to get prepared,"" spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told reporters in Geneva.
Health workers are treating every case of diarrhea as though it were cholera, Sebastian Rhodes Stampa, the deputy U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Mozambique, told reporters. While cholera is endemic to the region, ""when it does break out, it breaks out fast and it travels extremely fast,"" he said, stressing the need to strengthen disease surveillance.
Cyclone Idai, which stuck March 14, destroyed more than 50 health care clinics in central Mozambique, complicating the work to contain the disease, Radio Mozambique cited disaster management official Rui Costa as saying.
It is not yet clear whether any cholera deaths have been confirmed.
""We're not going to test every single case (for cholera) because it's not difficult to recognize when you look at the diarrhea of a patient. Once you see it once, you always recognize it,"" Gert Verdonck, Doctors Without Borders' emergency coordinator for Beira, told the AP.
Other suspected cholera cases are outside Beira in the badly hit areas of Buzi, Tica and Nhamathanda, he said, but the chance of spreading in rural areas is smaller because people are more dispersed.
In urban areas, however, cholera ""can have a huge impact if not contained quickly,"" Verdonck said. He said the 900,000 vaccine doses should be enough to cover targeted areas but that a second dose should be given after two weeks to strengthen protection.
The speed of the outbreak came as a surprise, he said. Earlier this week workers found 40 to 50 people with acute diarrhea at a health center in Munhava, one of Beira's poorest neighborhoods.
""We had to improvise,"" he said. Without space for the usual treatment setup of beds with holes and buckets underneath, they carved holes in plastic chairs instead for patients with enough strength to sit upright.
Outside, nails were pounded into walls to hand IV drips to rehydrate patients.
""You cannot wait to have a nice five-star tent,"" Verdonck said. ""We tried to go as quickly as possible.""
Cholera is not difficult to treat but the treatment needs to occur as early as possible, he said.
The cyclone badly damaged Beira's water supply, adding to the city's cholera risks. Some people have resorted to drinking stagnant water by the side of the road, increasing the chances of diarrhea. Others are drinking water from contaminated wells.
Some of the hardest-hit communities remain cut off from aid 15 days after the cyclone, and people are relying on heavily polluted water, the International Committee of the Red Cross said.
""You can imagine how much we are sitting on a water and sanitation ticking time bomb,"" the secretary-general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Elhadj As Sy, told the AP after visiting a school where 3,000 survivors had only six toilets to use.
The cyclone death toll in Mozambique inched up to 493 on Friday, with at least 259 dead in Zimbabwe and 56 in Malawi. Officials have warned that those numbers are preliminary and final figures may never be known. Some bodies have been found and buried without being registered with authorities. Others were washed away by the power of the storm.
Officials in Zimbabwe have not announced any cholera cases in the country's cyclone-hit region.
Mozambique President Filipe Nyusi has said the search and rescue phase has ended. He also declared that health care will be free for residents in cyclone-hit areas until the end of the year, Lusa reported.
The United Nations has said some 1.8 million people need urgent help across the sodden, largely rural region. Hunger is another growing concern, as the storm wiped out crops on the eve of harvest.
Officials have found a slender hope in the weather report, which appears free of rain for the next several days.

https://www.deseret.com/2019/6/16/20675738/summer-camp-is-newest-front-in-battle-with-measles-outbreak/,Summer camp is newest front in battle with measles outbreak,Deseret News,2019-06-16T14:55:16Z,"ALBANY, N.Y. — The battle to contain the worst U.S. measles outbreak in 27 years has a new front: summer camp.
Vaccinations have been made mandatory this summer for campers and staff in several counties north of New York City that annually fill up with kids from the Orthodox Jewish communities that have been hit hardest by measles.
Ulster County took the extra step of mandating the measles vaccine or proof of immunity at all day camps and overnight camps, becoming the latest county in the area to issue immunization requirements. Rockland County announced a similar order this month, following mandates from Sullivan and Orange counties.
""We have to make sure our t's are crossed and our i's are dotted in making sure all these vaccination records are in and have been fine-combed through to make sure everything is in compliance,"" said Rabbi Hanoch Hecht, of Ulster County's Camp Emunah, which hosts many girls from a Chabad community in Brooklyn's Crown Heights.
""In the past where we accepted religious exemptions for certain things,"" said Hecht, who is getting his own blood checked for immunity, ""now we cannot.""
The state of New York requires summer camps to keep immunization records for all campers, but doesn't bar children from attending if they haven't gotten a measles shot.
Children are required to get the measles vaccine to attend schools in New York, however, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed legislation Thursday eliminating an exemption for kids whose parents object to vaccinations on religious grounds.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that, as of June 1, more than 1,000 measles cases had been reported in the U.S. since the start of the year, up from fewer than 100 cases a year a decade ago. The bulk of those cases have been diagnosed in ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods in Brooklyn and suburban Rockland County.
The CDC recommends everyone over a year old should get the vaccine, except for people who had the disease as children. Those who have had measles are immune.
The vaccine, which became available in the 1960s, is considered safe and highly effective — paving the way for measles to be declared all but eliminated in the U.S. in 2000. But it has had a resurgence several times, including 667 cases in 2014.
Hecht and others stressed that vaccinations are widely accepted by most members of the Orthodox community, echoing rabbis in Brooklyn and Rockland County who say it is a relatively small group of parents influenced by anti-vaccination propaganda — not religious teachings — who have resisted inoculations.
The Orthodox Union said it has previously required up-to-date vaccinations, including the MMR vaccine, for its 37 summer programs.
""Most of the leaders and rabbis have taken the approach that vaccination is required,"" Hecht said.
Health officials in New York City have taken a tough approach, making measles vaccinations mandatory for everyone living in the Brooklyn neighborhood that is the epicenter of the outbreak, fining people for failing to get inoculated and closing 12 schools for failing to exclude staff and students who couldn't document immunity. The city announced the two most recent closures Thursday.
Now, as schools prepare to close down for the summer, the fight is spreading into the Catskills and Hudson River Valley.
Sullivan County is in the heart of the traditional Borscht Belt, and the lake-laden area still attracts thousands to its camps and bungalow colonies each summer. Of the 170 state-regulated camps in the county, 139 are Orthodox Jewish camps.
""We draw such a population from New York City, where this measles outbreak was,"" Sullivan County spokesman Dan Hust said. ""It was considered prudent and wise.""
Not everyone agrees. The orders from Sullivan and Orange counties were challenged in state courts by parents of various religious faiths. However, civil rights attorney Michael Sussman said Friday he believes those cases will have to be withdrawn given New York's removal of religious exemptions.
Several camp administrators interviewed by The Associated Press expressed no objection to mandatory vaccinations.
""We have no issue with that,"" said Yoel Landau, director at Camp Rav Tov, a camp for Hasidic boys in Monticello. Landau said schoolboys from New York City attending the camp should have already been vaccinated because of the city's order in April.
Rabbi Dovid Teichman, director of Camp Govoah, which caters to Orthodox campers in rural Greene County, said staffers were ""combing through each and every application to make sure that everyone is vaccinated.""
""I can't jeopardize anybody,"" he said. ""So if I find somebody that's on the list that's not vaccinating, I'm not taking them into camp.""",2019-06-16T14:55:16Z,2019,2,3
https://www.deseret.com/2019/6/6/20675020/us-measles-count-surpasses-1-000/,"US measles count surpasses 1,000",Deseret News,2019-06-06T13:02:50Z,"NEW YORK — Health officials say this year's U.S. measles epidemic has surpassed 1,000 illnesses.
It's already the highest in 27 years.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated the count Wednesday, saying 1,001 illnesses have been reported since the beginning of the year. Most are from outbreaks in New York in Orthodox Jewish communities.
The nation last saw this many cases in 1992, when more than 2,200 were reported.
Once common in the U.S., measles became rare after vaccination campaigns that started in the 1960s. A decade ago, there were fewer than 100 cases a year.
Overall vaccination rates have remained fairly high, but outbreaks have been happening in communities where parents have refused recommended shots for their children.",2019-06-06T13:02:50Z,2019,2,3
https://www.deseret.com/utah/2020/3/11/21175208/covid-19-coronavirus-utah-cases-quarantine-epidemic/,Health officials identify Utah’s 3rd and 4th coronavirus patients,Deseret News,2020-03-12T00:38:00Z,"SALT LAKE CITY — The third and fourth patients with confirmed cases of coronavirus were identified in Utah on Wednesday.
One of them is a Utah Jazz player, the other a 60-year-old Summit County man who recently traveled to Europe and had close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case during his trip.
After Utah Jazz player Rudy Gobert tested positive, it prompted the NBA to suspend its season “until further notice.” The Utah Jazz-Oklahoma City Thunder game was canceled shortly before the NBA made the announcement about the season.
Utah’s third confirmed coronavirus case, the unidentified 60-year-old man, has been recovering at home, the Utah Department of Health reported Wednesday.
“It is safe to say, with the patient being at home, that he’s doing well enough to be there and is not needing to be hospitalized,” Dr. Richard Orlandi, an otolaryngologist with University of Utah Health, said during a press briefing. He said the patient had only been home in Utah for a few days before he “correctly” sought medical help on the telephone and was able to arrange for testing without putting other patients at risk.
Because the man knew he might have contracted the coronavirus while away, there are “less than five” people he has come into close contact with and who the local health department is now monitoring, according to Keegan McCaffrey, an epidemiologist with the Utah Department of Health.
Summit County officials say they were ready and prepared for it to happen.
“Residents and visitors of Summit County can be assured that we’ve expected and prepared for COVID-19 in our community,” said Dr. Rich Bullough, director of the Summit County Health Department. “The system of identifying, reporting and now isolating the case has worked flawlessly.”
“We encourage residents and visitors not to be alarmed, but to take regular but important preventive health precautions such as correct hand-washing and staying home when sick,” Bullough said.
Utah Gov. Gary Herbert said in a statement late Wednesday that the rest of the Utah Jazz team was being screened for COVID-19 as a precautionary measure.
“We are working closely with the CDC and the NBA to gather more information on this case. We, along with the Utah Department of Health, are actively working to identify how long the patient (Gobert) has been experiencing symptoms, and are working to identify individuals who have had close enough contact with the player as to have been potentially exposed,” Herbert said.
Orlandi said that symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to that of influenza, including a fever, cough and/or shortness of breath. This novel strain of coronavirus, which leads to COVID-19, seems to be more severe in older people, which is a top concern for the health department, but McCaffrey said anyone is susceptible.
“As we see what’s happening throughout the rest of the world, it’s not surprising to see more cases,” Orlandi said, adding that the state health department is doing a great job of staying on top of Utah’s genealogy of this disease.
“We will continue to see more cases as the weeks roll on,” he said.
The Utah Department of Health has tested more than 136 people for COVID-19 locally, but that number jumps to around 150 when tests done by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are included.
Those numbers are ramping up, said Utah epidemiologist Dr. Angela Dunn, who estimates they are testing as many as 50 Utahns each day now. She said there is no limit on the number of tests available, but there is a short supply of personal protective equipment required by medical personnel to perform the tests.
Testing for the coronavirus includes collecting nasal and oral swabs from patients who not only exhibit symptoms, but have traveled outside of Utah or been in contact with other patients confirmed to have the disease.
Two other confirmed COVID-19 patients are being treated in Ogden, at McKay-Dee Hospital, and in an undisclosed home in southern Davis County. Both patients, older than 60, had recently traveled outside of Utah when they contracted the novel coronavirus, according to the health department.
Mark Jorgensen remains under quarantine at his home in St. George after contracting the illness aboard an international cruise ship. He isn’t counted among the four Utah patients.
State officials, as well as leaders in Salt Lake County, have declared a state of emergency “to ensure we are prepared to respond in the event of a coronavirus outbreak in the community,” Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson said Wednesday.
She has instituted what is called the Unified Command, which is a group of officials appointed to prepare to deal with potential outbreak throughout the state’s most populated county.
“Our community is strong and resilient,” Wilson said, adding that due to the size of the county, as well as its diversified workforce and strong economy, “we are well-prepared to handle this situation.”
“This worldwide outbreak has emphasized that infectious diseases do not know boundaries,” said Salt Lake County Health Department Executive Director Gary Edwards. “They go where people go.”
While there are now these confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Utah, there has yet to be any community transmission, or cases that spread from person to person, though McCaffrey said that is of imminent concern.
Though a similar respiratory illness, influenza doesn’t spread as quickly because a large portion of the population are immunized against it every year.
“There is no immunity for coronavirus,” Orlandi said. “This is a more severe disease as far as the severity of the illness a person can have and even the mortality is higher than the typical flu.”
There has been no official ban on large public gatherings, though many organizations, institutions and businesses in Utah have canceled conferences, restricted nonessential travel and moved communication to online platforms to avoid potential spread of illness throughout the community.
The Utah Legislature has set aside $16.5 million to deal with the potential influx of local patients, and the CDC on Wednesday announced that Utah will receive $6.4 million as part of the $8.3 billion divvied out to states to support COVID-19 response efforts.
“State and local health departments are on the front lines of responding to the COVID-19 outbreak, and we are deeply grateful for their work,” U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said. “President Trump, and his entire administration will continue working to ensure state and local jurisdictions have the resources they need to keep Americans safe and healthy.”
There is no vaccine available to prevent coronavirus disease and the CDC reports “the best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed.”
Utah Poison Control has partnered with the Utah Health Department to field calls at 1-800-456-7707, and answer questions from hundreds of callers each day, Dunn said.
Officials are, however, still asking the public to practice proper hand-washing and avoid touching their face, as well as staying home from work when sick.
“Showing up to work when ill is not proof of dedication to our workplace or to our employer,” Edwards said. “It can be dangerous and it puts others at risk of being infected.”
He said the coronavirus, officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on Wednesday, “is a matter of public health importance, but also personal preparedness.”

https://www.deseret.com/u-s-world/2020/3/24/21193587/virus-rescue-bill-agreement-congress-white-house-schumer-mcconnell-pelosi/,Washington agrees on unrivaled $2 trillion virus rescue bill,Deseret News,2020-03-25T18:16:55Z,"WASHINGTON — The White House and Senate leaders announced agreement Wednesday on an unparalleled, $2 trillion emergency bill to rush aid to businesses, workers and a health care system slammed by the coronavirus pandemic.
It’s the largest economic rescue bill in history. The package is intended as a weekslong or monthslong patch for an economy spiraling into recession or worse and a nation facing a grim toll from an infection that’s killed nearly 20,000 people worldwide.
Underscoring the effort’s sheer magnitude, the bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion annual federal budget.
”A fight has arrived on our shores,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. “We did not seek it, we did not want it, but now we’re going to win it.”
”Big help, quick help, is on the way,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.
But not enough, said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat whose state has seen more deaths from the pandemic than any other. “I’m telling you, these numbers don’t work.”
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said the package “goes a long way.” He said it requires strong oversight to ensure the wealthy don’t benefit at the expense of workers and proposed forgiving at least $10,000 of student loan debt as part of the federal response.
McConnell and Schumer said passage of the legislation was expected in the Republican-led Senate by the end of the day. After a banner day on Tuesday as the package took shape, the stock market rallied even more on Wednesday.
That would leave final congressional approval up to the Democratic-controlled House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the bipartisan agreement “takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people” but she stopped short of fully endorsing it.
“House Democrats will now review the final provisions and legislative text of the agreement to determine a course of action,” she said.
House members are scattered around the country and the timetable for votes in that chamber is unclear.
House Democratic and Republican leaders have hoped to clear the measure for President Donald Trump’s signature by a voice vote without having to call lawmakers back to Washington. But that may prove challenging, as the bill is sure to be opposed by some conservatives upset at its cost and scope. Ardent liberals were restless as well.
White House aide Eric Ueland announced the agreement in a Capitol hallway Wednesday, shortly after midnight, capping days of often intense haggling and mounting pressure. The wording of some final pieces of the agreement need to be completed.
The sprawling, 500-page-plus measure is the third coronavirus response bill produced by Congress and by far the largest. It builds on efforts focused on vaccines and emergency response, sick and family medical leave for workers, and food aid.
It would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home.
One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines. Hospitals would get significant help as well.
McConnell, a key negotiator, said the package will “rush new resources onto the front lines of our nation’s health care fight. And it will inject trillions of dollars of cash into the economy as fast as possible to help Americans workers, families, small businesses and industries make it through this disruption and emerge on the other side ready to soar.”
Five days of arduous talks produced the bill, creating tensions among Congress’ top leaders, who each took care to tend to party politics as they maneuvered and battled over crafting the legislation. But failure was never an option, which permitted both sides to mark big wins.
“That Washington drama does not matter any more,” McConnell said. “The Senate is going to stand together, act together, and pass this historic relief package today.”
The bill would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year, and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child
A huge cash infusion for hospitals expecting a flood of COVID-19 patients grew during the talks at Schumer’s insistence. Republicans pressed for tens of billions of dollars for additional relief to be delivered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the lead federal disaster agency.
Democrats said the package would help replace the salaries of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time.
Schumer said businesses controlled by members of Congress and top administration officials — including Trump and his immediate family members — would be ineligible for the bill’s business assistance.
The New York Democrat immediately sent out a roster of negotiating wins for transit systems, hospital, and cash-hungry state governments that were cemented after Democrats blocked the measure in votes held Sunday and Monday to maneuver for such gains.
But Cuomo said the Senate package would send less than $4 billion to New York, far short of his estimate that the crisis will cost his state up to $15 billion over the next year. More than 280 New Yorkers have died from the virus, a death toll more than double that of any other state.
Pelosi was a force behind $400 million in grants to states to expand voting by mail and other steps that Democrats billed as making voting safer but Republican critics said was political opportunism. The package also contains $15.5 billion more for a surge in demand for food stamps.
Republicans won inclusion of an “employee retention” tax credit that’s estimated to provide $50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50% of workers’ paychecks. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax.
A companion appropriations package ballooned as well, growing from a $46 billion White House proposal to more than $300 billion, which dwarfs earlier disasters — including Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy combined.
To provide transparency, the package is expected to create a new inspector general and oversight board for the corporate dollars, much as was done during the 2008 bank rescue, officials said.
Europe is enacting its own economic recovery packages, with huge amounts of credit guarantees, government spending and other support.
Germany alone, Europe’s biggest economy, has agreed to commit over 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion) in fiscal stimulus and support — roughly 30 percent of that nation’s entire annual output.
France, Spain and Italy have launched similar programs. The European Union has suspended limits it imposes on member countries’ borrowing and deficits, freeing them to spend more.
Some of Europe’s fiscal stimulus kicks in automatically without any new legislation due to social welfare safety nets that are more extensive than in the U.S.
At the White House on Tuesday, even as the public health crisis deepened, President Donald Trump expressed eagerness to nudge many people back to work in the coming weeks and held out a prospect, based more on hope than science, that the country could be returning to normal in less than a month.
Medical professionals say social distancing needs to be stepped up, not relaxed, to slow the spread of infections.
For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.
In the United States, more than 55,000 people have been sickened and more than 800 have died.

https://www.deseret.com/utah/2020/2/15/21137989/coronavirus-outbreak-preparation-emergency/,How can I prepare for a coronavirus outbreak?,Deseret News,2020-02-16T00:00:00Z,"SALT LAKE CITY — As fears over the new coronavirus continue to brew worldwide, multiple U.S. agencies have warned of scammers trying to exploit those anxieties.
Some criminals are taking advantage of people’s fears through websites, emails and texts promising prevention tips, claiming one’s neighbors have the virus, and even asking for donations, according to the Federal Trade Commission. Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warns of investment scams claiming certain companies have found cures and thus their stocks will grow.
According to the Better Business Bureau, as face masks from legitimate sources are selling out, scammers are also marketing and selling low quality and counterfeit masks.
“Others may never deliver anything all. In the worst cases, these sites are actually a way to steal your personal and credit card information, opening you up to identity theft,” the bureau said in a statement.
With misinformation and scammers floating around, how can Utahns prepare for a possible outbreak — and how urgent is it to do so?
“So even if people are using this coronavirus situation to get better prepared, that’s great.” — Wade Mathews, Be Ready Utah manager
Of the more than 10 people tested for the new human coronavirus — now dubbed COVID-19 — nobody in Utah has tested positive for it, and no one else is currently undergoing testing, according to Utah Department of Health spokeswoman Charla Haley. As of now, people should only wear face masks if they’re taking care of someone who has the virus, Haley said.
Though current risk in Utah might be low, it’s a good idea to prepare in case that changes, said Wade Mathews, Be Ready Utah manager. And many of the preparations one can make for the coronavirus match those needed in any emergency that could affect the Beehive State.
“It’s important to understand all of the risks where we live, not just the ones that seem scary,” Mathews said.
Among potential state disasters, Utah also experiences flooding, wildfires and earthquakes.
“Knowing the relative risk is very important and yes, being ready for them all the time. ... Preparedness is just common sense,” Mathews said.
He urged people to prepare with an at least 14-day supply of food, water and medications. N95 masks, or dust masks, are also good to have on hand as they can filter out most harmful particulate matter, Mathews said.
The Department of Homeland Security also urges people to regularly check their prescription medication supply to make sure they have enough on hand should a pandemic occur, as well as other health supplies. The agency also says people should store electronic versions of their health records from doctors, hospitals, pharmacies and other sources.
In any pandemic, the protective action is social isolation — which is already happening through quarantine measures in areas with cases reported, Mathews said.
If an outbreak hits Utah, he said people should stay home and wash their hands — essentially, use basic commonsense hygiene practices. A good communication plan between family members and loved ones is also important in case of any emergency.
“We always need to be prepared. That’s part of just what we’re trying to create as a culture of preparedness here in Utah, and in the country. That’s one of our goals at the state Division of Emergency Management, and one of FEMA’s goals, is creating a culture of preparedness,” Mathews said.
When emergencies or disasters happen internationally, they get many people thinking about whether they’re prepared.
“It’s an eye-opener. Really, what these types of things are, are an eye-opener for us. When an earthquake happens, a major earthquake in Haiti or down in South America, it’s a reminder to us yes, they do happen. They cause damage, they cause injury, and they cause death,” Mathews said.
“So we’ve been very fortunate not to have a lot of those types of emergencies here in Utah, but when they do happen around us in the world, we do need to recognize that they can happen here. And it’s a good reminder to go out and start storing food and water, and medication, and your disaster kits,” he said.
“So even if people are using this coronavirus situation to get better prepared, that’s great.”
One Utahn who was quarantined on a cruise ship in Japan has been hospitalized and confirmed to have coronavirus. Melanie Haering, wife of the man hospitalized, said on Friday that she also hoped to be tested.
Fifteen U.S. cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed, according to the Associated Press.
Mathews encouraged people to visit bereadyutah.gov for more emergency preparedness information. The Be Ready Utah Expo will also take place March 13-14 in Sandy and is open to the public. For more information, including cost, visit utah.gov/beready/prepare-conference.

https://www.deseret.com/utah/2020/5/13/21257451/covid-19-telehealth-consults-to-rural-utah-as-counties-request-fewer-restrictions-quicker-recovery/,Expert says end of COVID crisis requires herd immunity in Utah,Deseret News,2020-05-14T15:47:45Z,"SALT LAKE CITY — Utah’s top coronavirus expert says herd immunity is the only way the current coronavirus crisis will end in Utah.
“We’re not going to be able to prevent disease effectively until 60% to 80% of the population is immune to COVID-19,” Dr. Angela Dunn, state epidemiologist with the Utah Department of Health, said during Wednesday’s briefing at the state Capitol. “They either get infected or they get a vaccine.”
Herd immunity, though, she said, is “far away.”
“We are looking toward that vaccine to provide stability in our ability to respond to COVID-19,” Dunn said.
Dunn said that while Utah has a smaller number of older people — who have been determined to have a greater risk of complications from the illness — “from a public health perspective, we never want to put lives at risk unnecessarily for the sake of multiple people getting back to normal.”
“Those at high risk for severe disease are going to have to be really vigilant until we get that vaccine,” she said.
The Utah Department of Health reported on Wednesday an additional 188 cases of COVID-19 confirmed since Tuesday — a 2.9% growth rate — and that two more Utahns have died of the illness, bringing the state’s death toll to 75.
The agency noted that at least 156,786 people have been tested and 6,620 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed. As of Wednesday, 99 people were currently hospitalized, 18 more than the previous day.
The two additional deaths occurred in Salt Lake County and were males over age 65 who had been living in long-term care facilities. The county has now reported 51 fatalities related to the pandemic.
The numbers come as less-affected areas of the state are still requesting variances to Gov. Gary Herbert’s current public health order indicating the state is in a moderate risk category for the novel coronavirus. That order, as detailed in the state’s Utah Leads Together 2.0 plan, went into effect May 1 and will expire late Friday.
The TriCounty Board of Health, encompassing Uintah, Daggett and Duchesne counties, which has confirmed just 16 cases of COVID-19, one hospitalization and no deaths, voted Monday to move from the orange/moderate risk category to yellow or low-risk level, but such will require approval from the state level prior to implementation.
“It is the responsibility of every citizen in Uintah, Daggett and Duchesne counties to remain vigilant in following all the health and safety guideline as we move to the yellow phase of the Utah Leads Together plan,” said TriCounty Health officer Jordan Matthias. “Everyone’s actions are vital to ensure we can continue to move toward green, and don’t have to move back into orange.”
A yellow risk category still recommends that people wear masks and continue all sanitary precautions, but would allow all businesses to open, as well as schools in those areas, unless previous decisions on seasonal closures have already been made.
Counties in southwestern Utah have also made similar requests for a more swift economic recovery. And Zion National Park reopened its gates to the public with restriction in place on Wednesday.
Dunn said outbreaks are experienced differently in different places throughout the state, some even experiencing a decrease in cases while testing the same number of people. The state as a whole, however, she said, is not ready to make that transition. And that will largely depend on the actions of the public.
“What we’re asking Utahns to do is definitely hard,” Dunn said. “We are asking them to take measures that change our culture in order to prevent disease.”
Utah hasn’t been inundated with disease and people can still get the care they need, which, she said, can make it confusing for people.
But, Dunn said, “we’re not going to go back to ‘normal’ for some time.”
She said no model can predict the future of COVID-19 in Utah, or elsewhere, and because around just 5% have become infected so far here, it is important to maintain capacity and sustain the energy to manage it until a vaccine is available.
“We need to evaluate how we can still do the things we love and enjoy, just in a different way,” Dunn said.
Boost for telehealth services
The Federal Communications Commission announced nearly $800,000 in new grants for Intermountain Healthcare to extend its telehealth services and provide remote visits and consultations regarding coronavirus to more rural areas of the state, as well as in Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Arizona and Nevada.
To date, the FCC’s COVID-19 Telehealth Program, which was authorized by the federal government’s CARES Act, has funded 82 health care providers in 30 states at a total of $33.26 million. Intermountain was awarded one of the largest sums of 33 applicants across the United States on Wednesday.

On Friday afternoon, NBA commissioner Adam Silver spoke to players on a conference call and told them that a decision on returning wouldn’t have to be made until mid-June, that there would be at least three weeks of training time before play resumes and not to expect fans at games until there is a vaccine for COVID-19.
Additionally, Silver said playing games in one or two isolated locations would be safer than trying to play in home markets.
The ‘bubble’ concept
The idea that Silver and most pundits seem to be leaning toward is something that has become known colloquially as a “bubble” concept.
Essentially, every team, player, coach and staffer would be isolated at a specific neutral location. Games would be played at the location and players would live there and stay isolated from the rest of the population until the decided stretch of games is completed.
Locations
Orlando and Las Vegas have quickly become front runners for the NBA to carry out an isolated basketball bubble.
Las Vegas is where the NBA holds its annual Summer League, and of course it has many hotels which include restaurants and accommodations that would be able to house the people necessary for something as massive as an NBA bubble.
The most recent location that has seemed to catch on a little more than Vegas is Orlando, and very specifically Disney World.
Not only has Disney chairman Bob Iger been on board of governors calls with the NBA and been in contact with Silver, but the Orlando retreat is unique in what it offers. It is a private property with hotels, restaurants, accommodations and a sports complex with basketball courts which are broadcast ready. It doesn’t hurt that the Walt Disney Company also owns ESPN.
Logistics
While the idea of a bubble and keeping players isolated — in order to finish the season, complete the playoffs, or both — seems like a decent concept, it is just that; a concept, and it’s just the first step.
Silver has said that in order for the idea to become a reality, the first priority would be to assure daily testing of all players and staff for the coronavirus so that there can be confidence in health and safety. Until testing is widespread and readily available to healthcare workers and those at risk in the general population, Silver is not willing to take tests that could go to others in order to use them for the sake of basketball.
After assuring the safety of everyone involved, there is a litany of details that would have to be ironed out. How would everyone get to Orlando or Las Vegas? Commercial travel? Chartered flights? Would they need to be quarantined and isolated before interacting with each other? Are families going to be accompanying those headed to the self-contained bubble city?
For those not associated with the NBA, there are concerns and logistical problems as well. There would have to be fully staffed hotels and restaurants. If those employees were able to come and go from the bubble, it would defeat the purpose. So, all of the employees would also need accommodations within the bubble.
Then there’s basketball to think about. The players are going to need time to get back into shape. Would they be playing out any regular season games or will they just play postseason ball? Would there be exhibitions? Will teams be playing seven-game playoff series?
The timing of everything matters, and how long the league would spend in a given city completing the 2019-20 season is important because there will be ripple effects that span through the draft, free agency and into the next season.
Concerns
While many support the bubble concept, there are many, including some players, who still have concerns, and rightfully so.
Prior to Friday’s conference call between players and Silver, National Basketball Players Association executive director Michele Roberts spoke to ESPN’s Ramona Shelburne and noted that players were concerned that being isolated at Disney or anywhere else doesn’t mean that someone from the outside couldn’t come in or that someone could shirk the rules, leave and come back and potentially infect those in the bubble.
Those concerns were raised on the call with Silver, who was asked what would happen if someone within the bubble tested positive for COVID-19. Would everything have to be shut down all over again?
While Silver reiterated the need for daily testing available for all players and staff before the bubble concept could become a reality, it still doesn’t take away the fear that many players have.
“The questions have now evolved from, ‘Are we going to play again?’ to, ‘If we play, what are the risks going to look like?’” Roberts said.",2020-05-09T20:26:04Z,2020,2,5

My husband, Grit, and I are being obedient because we have seen these plagues come and go through the years, and are hopeful this one will be contained and there will be a vaccine soon and things can get back to normal.
It’s very different for our children, especially those with young children, trying to keep them content. No one likes to be cloistered unless it’s a life choice. We are missing our grandchildren, which was the reason we moved away from Connecticut in the first place, so I, like you, am hoping people heed the warnings so this chaos will end sooner than later.
I was a child of World War II so I know of panic and rationing. My father served as a radio operator in the Navy on a destroyer in the Pacific, so I know about fear and worry even at 5 years old. When the enemy planes came, their first target was to take out the radio tower. My prayers were filled with pleadings to keep my father safe — and gratefully they were answered.
Next came the polio scare, which was another fearful time coming fairly soon on the heels of World War II. Mothers hovered over their children, warning them with pictures of people in the iron lung machine, filling all with fear. At the height of the crisis, I wasn’t allowed to go swimming all one summer. That was hard, especially as I lived in Farmington, Utah, the “Fun Spot of Utah” with that huge welcoming pool that I wickedly did sneak down to once with my friend Nancy.
Primary was on a weekday in those years. I remember a song we sang every week while we marched around the room to put our pennies and nickels in a jar, hoping to help the cause:
“Five pennies make a nickel, two nickels make a dime, ten dimes will make a dollar, and we’ll make it shine. It’s for the crippled children who cannot walk or run, who have to stay in bed all day and cannot join our fun. So let us all be unselfish and bring our pennies here, to help the crippled children become stronger year by year. Let’s march along and sing our song and pray that they may be, a little stronger every day because of you and me.”
Gratefully a vaccine was developed by Jonas Salk. We received our vaccinations at school, and the polio shot was given to all schoolchildren in America in the early ’50s. We would line up around the room nervous and giggling but would bravely raise our sleeves in compliance. We didn’t want to be the ones with lifelong damage had occurred for so many others.
There have always been illness that swept the world since the beginning of time. In 1918, the Spanish flu could pass so quickly a person could be well in the morning and be dead by nighttime.
1957 brought the Asian flu with a few outbreaks in the summer of 1957. It was spread widely once the students went back to school. I was away at college in my first year at Brigham Young University. I do not remember any panicking about it, people just got sick and some left school, but I don’t remember any deaths. I did not get it, but in the second wave that went through many elderly died. Then there was the Hong Kong flu in 1968, the swine flu in 1976, the Russian flu in 1977 as well as the avian flu in 1997 and A/H9N2 in 1999.
A difference with COVID-19 that stands out to me is that parents in the 50s were worried about their children getting the polio virus. With the coronavirus, our kids are worried about us. They constantly remind us to stay out of stores and practice social distancing, because anyone older than 60 is more subject to serious complications or death.
I worry that we are overreacting this time because it has been such a total shutdown. I fear there will be a lot of economic turmoil for awhile because of it. Can we rise above it? I think that is what we are all hoping will happen, and quickly.
There are some rewards of all this, and for many it is understanding the importance of family. Our son Jim and wife, Shamberlin, invited our granddaughter Andie Wells over for the weekend. They had been together often in the last month, so didn’t feel they were endangering each other. Jim has three boys and two girls ages 14 to 2, and the Wells have two girls, 3 years old and a baby. They held church with everyone participating doing the various responsibilities. Six-year-old Emē was so excited because she was able to lead the singing. Because Andie’s husband Brady is a medical student, they could stay on a few more days, and both mothers were delighted to see their children keep each other happy.
In the meantime I am pining for my family who I only see on social media, and as Grit and I are the family elders, we are hoping to stay well through this current flu siege.",2020-04-10T20:00:00Z,2020,2,5

That vaccine will require scientific discovery and technological innovation. Meanwhile, we can’t just sit back and wait for the vaccine but must apply principles of public health to reduce our risks.
In addition to the formidable coronavirus, we face another crisis: our changing climate. Like COVID-19, we hope for a “cure,” a way of living without spewing CO2 and other heat-trapping gasses into the atmosphere. We hope for innovation to solve the problem, but meanwhile must reduce emissions with the tools we have.
President Donald Trump has created “Operation Warp Speed” to facilitate the development of a vaccine. Similarly, we need policy to facilitate a “warp speed” transition to a zero-carbon economy. HB763, the federal Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, is an important first step. This bill will put a price on fossil fuels and return the proceeds to all Americans. It will stimulate innovation while motivating everyone to make lower carbon choices.
While COVID-19 is taking its toll, the earth is also getting dangerously warmer. Let’s tackle both problems with sound science and effective policy.

COVID-19 has made it bittersweet,Deseret News,2020-06-08T04:00:00Z,"BOULDER, Garfield County — Blake Spalding has been in Boulder for 20 years now. These days, she says there are more tourists passing by her restaurant than ever before.
If only they could come in.
The tiny southwest Utah town, whose population hovers around 300, sits just north of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. With Utah beginning to ease its coronavirus pandemic restrictions, the monument just reopened, bringing a flood of otherwise cooped-up visitors. And if weren’t for the coronavirus, Spalding’s restaurant, Hell’s Backbone Grill & Farm, would be serving those visitors.
Spalding co-owns Hell’s Backbone with Jen Castle. The two have received considerable acclaim during the restaurant’s 20 years, including features in the New Yorker and O, The Oprah Magazine, as well as multiple semifinalist selections by the James Beard Foundation. Spalding defines their menu as “fanciful Four Corners cuisine,” which utilizes organic, locally produced food, much of it grown on their six-acre farm and two gardens.
This year, the James Beard Foundation nominated Hell’s Backbone for Best Chef in the Mountain region, which encompasses Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Utah and Wyoming. The winner will be announced Sept. 25. This nomination is the highest culinary honor Hell’s Backbone has received thus far — “the James Beards are like the Oscars of food,” Spalding explained.
And yet, the nomination is bittersweet right now. Spalding, Castle and their employees have been trying to find a safe path toward reopening. They applied for and received Personal Paycheck Protection loans, but they’re still looking for a good source of bulk gloves, masks and sanitizer for the restaurant’s 40-plus employees. Additionally, some of the Hell’s Backbone employees who moved to Utah from out of state have had friends and extended family members back home die or become seriously ill from the disease. Spalding and Castle not only have to manage logistics, but grief.
“As a human being, the ethics of this … and asking people to work when we don’t have enough information yet, it feels like a really tricky path to walk, and stay in integrity,” Spalding said.
“I will say that in my career, this is the hardest thing I’ve ever done.”
“Fine dining is inherently really intimate. Historically, to serve you, we would pretty much get within four inches of our guests.” — Blake Spalding
While Hell’s Backbone is highly regarded outside Utah, the restaurant is also Boulder’s lifeblood in some crucial ways. It employs a high percentage of Boulder’s population. People have moved to Boulder specifically to work at Hell’s Backbone, and several of them have launched their own businesses and raised families in the town. If the restaurant were to close permanently, the ripple effect would significantly impact Boulder’s economy, possibly its school enrollment numbers, and certainly its infrastructure. Yes, Hell’s Backbone relies on tourism, but the Boulder community relies on Hell’s Backbone.
Luckily, the restaurant has spent years establishing two other revenue streams. Its farm and gardens supply fresh fruit, vegetables and eggs to some other Utah restaurants. Hell’s Backbone also has a retail line that includes two bestselling cookbooks — “With a Measure of Grace” and “The Immeasurable Place” — as well as pancake mix, oatmeal, various spices and cooking supplies, housewares and apparel. Spalding said these other ventures were doing OK before the pandemic, but have since become a lifesaver for them. These days, the staff has pivoted to farm work and retail shipping.
“So we’re currently shipping out a lot of packages a day,” she said. “Which is good, because it also helps the post office — which we rely on very much here, because there’s no UPS or FedEx pickup here. There’s not a solution for Boulder. If the U.S. Postal Service doesn’t get funded again, we are going to be in trouble.”
Hell’s Backbone is attached to Boulder Mountain Lodge, which reopened on May 29, according to the lodge’s website. Spalding said the restaurant is exploring ways to offer room service to the lodge’s guests, which is something it has never done before. Hell’s Backbone will begin offering room service, as well as takeout and expanded open-air dining, sometime in June, but Spalding admits that “the new Hell’s Backbone Grill in the time of COVID is going to look appreciably different than the old one. And I don’t want people to feel let down or disappointed.”
Open-air dining is safer than indoor dining in the current circumstances, but Boulder’s elevation is nearly 7,000 feet above sea level, and southern Utah in the summer gets quite hot. Spalding said the restaurant won’t be doing reservations in 2020, opting instead for first-come, first-serve. It will not reopen its indoor dining space until there’s a safer way to do it for the staff and guests (a COVID-19 vaccine, cure or reliable antibody tests).
Since restaurant service isn’t the only revenue stream for Hell’s Backbone, one infected worker could shut down not just the restaurant operation, but also the farming and retail revenue streams. That would have a huge impact on Boulder. So Spalding and Castle are cautiously and conservatively moving forward right now while trying to reimagine fine dining in the COVID-19 era.
“Fine dining is inherently really intimate,” Spalding explained. “Historically, to serve you, we would pretty much get within four inches of our guests. To set a plate down, … to pour a glass from a beautiful bottle of wine, you have to get very close to the table.”
She’s encouraged by the hordes of people visiting Boulder right now, and the recent James Beard honor. Spalding said Hell’s Backbone gets a ton of phone calls right now, from visitors wondering if the restaurant is open yet. Things are moving in the right direction, even if so much remains uncertain.
“It’s hard not knowing, when there’s a lot of information we still don’t have about the way this virus acts and what’s going to happen,” she said. “I’m just hoping we get more information. But we may not.”",2020-06-08T04:00:00Z,2020,2,5
https://www.deseret.com/indepth/2020/4/15/21222249/coronavirus-covid-19-utah-reopen-economy-social-distancing-church-religion-gathering-ban/,"Poll: Reopening churches tops schools, sports venues as a priority for Americans",Deseret News,2020-04-15T18:36:54Z,"SALT LAKE CITY — If Americans got to choose, houses of worship would be one of the first organizations reopened when social distancing restrictions are scaled back, according to a new poll on reopening society from Scott Rasmussen.
More than one-third of registered voters (35%) said in-person church services and other religious gatherings should be opened as soon as possible. Fewer Americans said the same about schools (31%), bars and restaurants (21%) and large entertainment events, like NBA games and concerts (14%), the survey reported.
In general, Americans seem more interested in regaining opportunities to connect with each other than jump-starting the economy, Rasmussen wrote. Half of respondents said allowing people to gather in small groups at friends’ homes should be a top priority once the threat of spreading the coronavirus has decreased.
This focus on social events is “not surprising,” since many Americans are feeling isolated, bored and depressed right now, Rasmussen said.
However, people’s interest in hosting game nights or attending worship services hasn’t gotten much attention in recent debates over how and when to reopen society. Most policymakers are more focused on getting workers back to their offices than improving people’s social lives.
“The prospect of mass gathering is negligible at best until we get to herd immunity and we get to a vaccine,” said California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday.
The Justice Department issued a statement Tuesday highlighting the value of religious communities during difficult times, but also noting that government officials are allowed to ban large church services for as long as those gatherings pose a public safety risk.
“When the community as a whole faces an impending harm of this magnitude, and where the measures are tailored to meeting the imminent danger, the Constitution does allow some temporary restriction on our liberties that would not be tolerated in normal circumstances,” Attorney General William P. Barr wrote.
Most houses of worship in the U.S. stopped offering in-person services in mid-March, but building closures haven’t prevented religious leaders from connecting with members of their congregations in other ways.
Nearly 6 in 10 church members (57%) say their house of worship is now offering services online, according to a poll released earlier this month by the American Enterprise Institute.
Despite many congregations’ embrace of new forms of worship, state leaders’ efforts to ban large religious gatherings remain controversial. Churches across the country have filed lawsuits challenging restrictions on large events and stay-at-home orders.
In some cases, debates over the rights of churches have become partisan. For example, Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, who is a Democrat, sued state Republican leaders after they attempted to overturn her ban on gatherings larger than 10 people last week and enable Easter services to go on as planned. The Kansas Supreme Court sided with Kelly in a ruling released Saturday night.
The new Rasmussen poll shows that people’s political beliefs seems to affect how interested they are in reopening churches. Nearly half of registered Republican voters (47%) said re-opening churches should be a top priority, compared to 29% of registered Democrats.
The survey was fielded from April 9-11, 2020, and 1,200 registered voters took part. The margin of error for the full sample is 3.0 percentage points.",2020-04-15T18:36:54Z,2020,2,5
https://www.deseret.com/sports/2020/5/15/21259848/tokyo-olympics-paralympic-unconventional-2020-2021-costs/,Tokyo Olympic CEO: Games next year may not be ‘conventional’,Deseret News,2020-05-15T13:10:52Z,"TOKYO — Almost two months after the Tokyo Olympics were postponed, organizing committee CEO Toshiro Muto said Friday he still could not give an estimate of how much the one-year delay will cost.
Figures in the Japanese media have ranged between $2 billion and $6 billion, with most mounting expenses likely to be covered by government entities.
Although he was vague about the costs and who will pay, Muto was very clear about one thing in the online news conference.
“The actual games we will have one year from now may not be the same conventional Olympic and Paralympic Games that we have come to know,” he said, speaking in Japanese and translated through in interpreter.
Muto floated ideas about cuts everywhere, though the only specific target he mentioned was the torch relay.
“We are looking into every possible area,” he said. “It’s time for all of us to review what are the essential things for the games. What are the must-have items? ... I think we might come up with a new Olympic and Paralympic Games, something that is unique to Tokyo.”
Tokyo’s future still has more questions than answers.
How will 11,000 Olympic athletes and 4,400 Paralympians be housed in the Athletes Village? Will the tight quarters be safe? How will they travel to Tokyo? How will they train and qualify? And what about thousands more staff and games officials?
Will there be fans, or will it be a television-only show? What about millions of tickets already sold? Will there be refunds? Will a vaccine be available? Will young, healthy athletes be a priority for a vaccine?
Muto spoke a day after the Switzerland-based International Olympic Committee acknowledged it would have added costs of $800 million because of the postponement. The IOC said $150 million would be made available for loans to national Olympic committees and sports federations, some of which have few sources of revenue outside the games.
But the IOC gave no details of where the other $650 million would go.
Muto said he didn’t know, either. Or at least he wasn’t saying.
“As to the breakdown of how this money will be used, the IOC has said it’s too early to tell,” Muto said. “So we at the organizing committee have no idea of all the details about how this money will be spent.”
Soaring Olympic costs are sure to be a touchy subject as Japan, like most countries, battles a deep recession brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.
Japanese organizers and government bodies are obligated by a Host City Contract signed in 2013 to pick up most of the Olympic costs. When they were awarded the games seven years ago, Tokyo officials said the Olympics would cost just over $7 billion.
Tokyo now says it is spending $12.6 billion to organize the games, but a government audit report last year said it was twice that much.
All but $5.6 billion is public money.
Muto said organizers are still trying to guarantee that 43 venues will be available next year, hoping to keep the same event schedule when the Olympics open on July 23, 2021.
“It’s going to take a bit of time,” Muto said, “and that cannot be helped.”",2020-05-15T13:10:52Z,2020,2,5
https://www.deseret.com/opinion/2020/6/2/21278209/effectively-reopening-schools-this-fall-will-require-herd-immunity-targeted-isolation/,"Guest opinion: Effectively reopening schools this fall will require herd immunity, targeted isolation",Deseret News,2020-06-02T19:00:00Z,"As the next academic year approaches, COVID-19 is forcing schools to wrestle with how to balance safety and learning. Since it is unlikely the COVID-19 outbreak can be fully extinguished, what is the right strategy for students returning to school in the fall?
Safety is a paramount concern. But of the 81,372 U.S. deaths by May 23, only 112 have been in people under 24. And only 1 of the 9 New York City victims under 18 had no preexisting conditions. In fact, patients with preexisting conditions are the majority of deaths across all ages, explaining why 42% of U.S. deaths have been in care facilities for the elderly. Of 12,667 total New York City deaths, only 96 deaths were in healthy individuals. COVID-19 is not a significant health concern for the otherwise healthy. And schools are overwhelmingly populated by the young and healthy.
Should schools use testing, masks and social distancing measures in the fall? Most schools are considering such measures, but masks and distancing communicate fear and stress, affecting learning. Further, some important educational experiences are incompatible with masks and distancing. On the other hand, without such measures, an outbreak is more likely in the close quarters of a crowded class.
How might an uncontrolled outbreak impact schools? Based on New York City’s experience, Utah would expect less than 20 COVID-19 deaths among its roughly 650,000 K-12 students. Meanwhile, a university of 30,000, whose students are older and are more likely to have preexisting conditions, might expect 12 COVID-19 student deaths.
But if students with preexisting conditions are selectively quarantined and use remote learning opportunities, classes will contain primarily healthy students. Most deaths would be prevented. Utah would expect only two K-12 deaths, while a university of 30,000 would expect, on average, less than one death.
Importantly, fewer deaths resulting from targeting quarantine of the vulnerable does not require any masks or other social distancing measures. With a student population that includes the vulnerable, the same reduction in deaths requires that mitigation policies reduce spread by 90% in the K-12 environment and 96% in the higher education environment. That masks and social distancing can be this effective is questionable.
Lack of social distancing measures does increase the likelihood of an outbreak and allows it to spread. But a rise in the number of cases is not fundamentally important if deaths are avoided and hospitalizations are kept within health care system capacity. The goal is to divorce cases from deaths, after which cases can rise without concern.
In fact, widespread exposure to the resilient student population can make schools safe from COVID-19 for the healthy and the vulnerable alike. Once about two-thirds of students are exposed and acquire immunity, outbreaks in schools will burn out before gaining any traction. The vulnerable can stop using distance learning and physically return to school, without fear and without having to rely on any social distancing measures.
Though there are logistical challenges to targeted isolation of the vulnerable, the measures would undoubtedly be more palatable than when applied to an increasingly restive general population. Testing and tracing within a smaller, targeted population is also more manageable. Resources supporting remote learning can be focused on those who really need them. Compared to broad, untargeted lockdowns, the cost of targeted isolation is more sustainable.
Smothering an outbreak with widespread exposure is called herd immunity. One concern is whether exposure to COVID-19 results in meaningful immunity. While this concern is real, results from animal models used in vaccine development are very encouraging. Further, the SARS virus of 2002 yielded immunity that lasted at least three years. Finally, in a study of 160 frontline health care workers in France that developed after being infected with COVID-19, 98% produced neutralizing antibodies that confer immunity. The French study specifically tested patients experiencing mild symptoms, where immunity is less likely.
Selectively isolating the vulnerable while generating herd immunity by allowing COVID-19 to spread through the healthy population is a fast and permanent way to end the current outbreak. While a vaccine would achieve the same outcome, it remains unclear when a vaccine will be ready. But herd immunity by natural exposure can begin immediately. In fact, that COVID-19 is highly contagious nature is a major advantage, since it means exposure sufficient for herd immunity can be reached quickly and targeted isolation of the vulnerable can end.

By congressional resolution, July 16–24 is known as the Apollo Space Observance (the anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon mission, from launch date to splashdown). July 20, the date of the first moonwalk, is known as Space Exploration Day and is an emerging, new holiday.
Space exploration benefits humanity in many areas, including zero-gravity manufacturing, space tourism and mining, aerospace technological spinoffs and astronomy.
The manufacturing of special condition products in zero-G or microgravity benefits any process where convection currents would otherwise be a problem. Some serums and vaccines are difficult to produce on earth, making them extremely expensive for the public. Despite space transportation costs, they can be mass-produced cheaply in zero gravity aboard a space station, making them of higher quality and more affordable to the public.
At present, space tourism is highly expensive ($200,000 a seat for a sub-orbital flight). That transportation cost can be reduced to $15,000 per seat for an orbital flight, using emerging new commercial Scramjet technology. The technology required to make this lower-cost space transportation possible involves engines powered by magneto-electrodynamics, and an emerging new radio frequency-ion containment fusion power. With the proper national commitment, we could have commercial space liners in five years.
With the price of the trip to earth orbit decreasing, the trip from earth orbit to the moon will also be at a lower cost — much less than the cost of climbing out of earth’s gravity well. Right now, the only practical mining on the moon would be for hydrogen 3, to be used in producing fusion power. With much lower space transportation costs, lunar and asteroid mining possibilities will come into play worth trillions of dollars. An underground metals deposit was recently found on the moon, five times larger than the Big Island of Hawaii. Asteroids are rich in nickel, iron ores and many other metals, including some that are rare on earth.
Setting up automated mining and a supporting lunar settlement will be necessary to support lunar industries. Using lunar resources, these settlements can in large measure be self-supporting. Successful lunar activity will make a Mars settlement possible — within a reasonable cost, as well.
Development of new aerospace technologies, to support space exploration, has a long history of spurring new private sector industries and millions of reasonable income jobs. If it wasn’t for advancement in the space program, we wouldn’t have personal computers and the internet would have been limited to the military. It is recognized that substantial advancements in electronics have been made since the days of Project Apollo. I once heard a retired U.S. senator from Utah say that the benefits of space technology are worth 15 times the cost of the space program.
Arguments against progress in space, due to world poverty conditions, are basically either-or paradox-style propaganda. In reality, the world has sufficient resources to make great progress in both areas.
The study of the universe, planets, moons, asteroids and comets help us better understand our place in the universe. Appreciation of these vast wonders contribute to recognizing the hand of the Lord in all things. Elder John A. Widtsoe taught in 1926, “Whoever teaches that any part of the Universe is not for the benefit of man is in error.”
We do have much to be thankful for.

UK scientist predicts virus’ future,Deseret News,2020-08-25T12:00:00Z,"Former British chief scientific adviser Mark Walport said in a recent interview that people may need continuous vaccinations to stay safe from the novel coronavirus.
- Walport — a former scientific adviser to the British government — said COVID-19 will likely be around forever, and that people will need many vaccinations to keep it from spreading.
- Walport told BBC News: “This is a virus that is going to be with us forever in some form or another, and almost certainly will require repeated vaccinations. So, a bit like flu, people will need revaccination at regular intervals.”
- Walport said COVID-19 is not like smallpox, which can be erased with one vaccine. He said people will need vaccinations “at regular intervals.”
Dr. Fauci said something similar
White House coronavirus adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci said in July that the world may never fully end the coronavirus from spreading, as I wrote for Deseret.com.
Fauci said in an interview with TB Alliance that the virus will never fully disappear.
- “I think with a combination of good public health measures, a degree of global herd immunity and a good vaccine, which I do hope and feel cautiously optimistic that we will get, I think when we put all three of those together, we will get control of this, whether it’s this year or next year. I’m not certain.

https://www.deseret.com/opinion/2020/8/6/21356108/utah-schools-pandemic-reopening-education-masks-covid-19/,The right way to reopen school is impossible to find right now,Deseret News,2020-08-06T15:00:00Z,"Now we know — the people who crowded a Utah County Commission meeting several weeks ago to protest Gov. Gary Herbert’s mask mandate for schools this fall represented a minority.
Most of you think it’s right that students, teachers and administrators wear masks right now.
A poll commissioned by the Deseret News and the Hinckley Institute of Politics found 62% of Utahns agreeing with the governor, with 27% opposed and 10% saying they don’t know.
But that’s about all a lot of people know with any surety. Only 48% answered yes to the question of whether their local schools should open for in-person classes, and a whopping 21% weren’t sure.
We are on the precipice of deciding the when and how of school in the fall. It’s a daunting decision because no one has all the facts.
As a Deseret News report wryly noted Wednesday, people in the Davis School District recently marched in protest against a plan to alternate students between in-person and online classes, while a different group further south marched in protest against the Granite District’s plan to give parents the option of in-person or online learning. The Granite protesters wanted the plan the Davis protesters were against.
I’m surprised more people in that poll weren’t unsure.
This is not a multiple-choice question. There is no definitively right answer about how to reopen school. Not yet, anyway.
If we could stand on a distant hill in, say, 2025 and look back, the answer would be there, but not now; not in the middle of it all. We assume everyone wants what’s best for the kids, and that they also want to protect the older, more vulnerable people those kids come home to each afternoon. Children need interaction and they need in-person instruction. Teachers need surety, and they need protection.
But what we all really need right now is for COVID-19 to go away, and despite a recent decline in new cases in Utah, that isn’t happening.
And please, don’t tell me fears of the virus are overblown. Talk to someone who has had it. Talk to someone, like me, who has lost close friends to it.
Meanwhile, after the first day of school this week in the Cherokee County School District in Georgia, CNN reported a second grader tested positive. The district is holding in-person classes, and children are not required to wear masks. In Georgia’s Marietta District, five employees, including teachers, tested positive after some pre-planning sessions.
This is this kind of thing Utah schools need to avoid. A complete shutdown, after school has reopened, would be devastating.
But schools also need to avoid a continuation of the uneven and uncertain instruction that characterized the last part of the previous school year. Children, even those whose homes don’t have the internet or enough computers to go around, need to learn, too.
And looming behind this multifaceted problem is the reality of COVID-19, which hasn’t disappeared and for which no vaccine is yet available.
As Mary Beth Griggs, science editor at The Verge, wrote in April, we’re in this for the long haul. “Victory over the virus will involve a lot of things that we don’t have yet.”
In Japan, a nation where mask wearing is part of the culture and cases have been low, a “formidable resurgence” is underway, to quote Bloomberg. In Melbourne, Australia, officials thought they had the virus licked. Now, a new wave is underway, leading to a new lockdown The New York Times said is among the toughest in the world.
We know from experience that what happens in distant parts of the industrialized world will come here eventually, even with travel restrictions in place.
In the meantime, protesters, school district leaders and everyone else in the fray deserves respect. They are part of a great civic experiment, seeking the best way to forge on with school amid uncertainty, and without all the facts.
An art teacher at a local junior high school may have said it best when she told the Deseret News that she has never felt more unprepared heading into a new school year.
What we do know is that teachers and students in Utah will be wearing masks and will be kept apart from each other as much as possible.
It’s not ideal, but, as most of you seem to agree, it’s the best that can be done until the virus is gone.",2020-08-06T15:00:00Z,2020,3,6
https://www.deseret.com/u-s-world/2020/9/17/21439885/coronavirus-flu-shot-dr-anthony-fauci/,Here’s when Dr. Fauci plans to get his flu shot,Deseret News,2020-09-17T15:00:00Z,"Dr. Anthony Fauci has a specific time of the year when he gets his flu shot — and it’s not until next month.
What’s going on:
Health experts are encouraging people to get their flu vaccinations this year to help limit the amount of flu infections and the spread of coronavirus.
Fauci, an infectious disease specialist, recently told Jennifer Garner in an Instagram interview that October might be the best month to get the shot, CNBC reports.
- He said he gets his shot “toward the middle and end of October.”
- “I wouldn’t necessarily get it now, in September, because there is evidence that, in fact, the immunity might wear off when you get to February and early March,” he said.
He said this is an “unofficial” suggestion on when to get the shot, according to CNBC.
Other experts agree:
Dr. Miriam Alexander, with LifeBridge Health, recently told WBAL-TV 11 that October is a good month to get your shot because the strains often last from October to March.
- “The reason for that is the flu shot seems to only work for about six months and we always have quite a lot of flu in our communities in March. We want to make sure people are protected against the flu in March.”
Alexander encouraged all Americans to get their shot this year to stay safe from the flu.
- “There should be an extra level of urgency that we and all of our friends and loved ones get the flu shot.”
- “We don’t want to confuse the picture when we as a medical community are trying to figure out what’s going on with people. If they know they’ve had the flu shot, then we will think more COVID than we will flu.”",2020-09-17T15:00:00Z,2020,3,6
https://www.deseret.com/utah/2020/8/9/21346229/how-much-does-the-current-coronavirus-pandemic-resemble-pandemic-1918-quite-a-bit/,How much does the current pandemic resemble the pandemic of 1918? Quite a bit,Deseret News,2020-08-10T00:33:00Z,"SALT LAKE CITY — When the new coronavirus began ravaging the world, most people had no idea just how much damage a viral outbreak could do to the world’s health, wealth and social fabric.
But a 2004 book by John M. Barry titled “The Great Influenza” chronicles how the 1918-19 influenza outbreak became the deadliest pandemic in history, and it offers both insight and warnings about how to mitigate future pandemics, which the author concludes are inevitable.
It was the book former President George W. Bush reportedly read that caused him to charge Homeland Security personnel with formulating an ambitious pandemic response plan that included a national stockpile of face masks and ventilators, and a process to fast-track vaccines and other treatments in 2005.
While some of that became a reality, many of those things Barry warned about were not heeded, including allocating resources to vaccine development in U.S. labs and making sure all governments report viral and disease outbreaks accurately to the World Health Organization.
Among the issues he cited was the fact that China’s decision to “initially lie and hide” the 2003 SARS outbreak put the world at risk. He asserted that if WHO, led by the U.S., didn’t find a way to make sure all countries accurately report disease outbreaks, an influenza-like virus would, once again, sicken and kill record numbers of people, despite 100 years of medical advances.
The book provides details into everything from the rise of American medicine to how lingering effects of influenza could have led to President Woodrow Wilson’s abrupt decision to accept the Treaty of Versailles to end World War I when he’d consistently advocated for a much different end to the war.
What is striking about Barry’s book is how many similarities there are between the 1918-19 pandemic and the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. But it is also interesting to look at the differences, and the lessons that Americans didn’t necessarily learn.
Masks
The most notable similarity is the controversy over masks.
In 1918, masks were just as controversial as they are in 2020. The difference is that masks were mandatory during the influenza outbreak, and — with the exception of Salt Lake, Summit and Grand counties plus Logan and Springdale — Utah and much of the country has relied on only mask recommendations.
The rejection of some to wearing masks as a way to slow the spread of COVID-19 is something that has blindsided Utah and national public health officials.
“I don’t think any of us anticipated a mask debate,” said Utah epidemiologist Dr. Angela Dunn. “It seems so simple.”
The reasons for rebelling against mask mandates in 1918 and mandates or recommendations in 2020 are very similar. Most often cited by opponents is that they see the requirement as an erosion of individual liberties. Others suggest masks may cause illness or that they’re ineffective in stopping the spread of any disease, including COVID-19.
Part of the issue cited is the lack of trust some currently have in health officials, governmental leaders and the media.
But officials in 1918 and 1919 actually issued mask mandates, according to Utah news reports, and for those who violated the rules, there were fines and sometimes arrests and jail time, including a Park City man who was arrested at a restaurant for not wearing a mask. He was held in jail for three days before winning his freedom.
Greg Smoak, the director of the American West Center and an associate professor of history at the University of Utah, said the resistance and debate over the efficacy of masks may be similar, but the masks themselves were quite different.
“They were essentially gauze that would be tied behind your head,” Smoak said of the masks used in 1918-19. “They were old-school surgical masks, and there was a huge debate over them.”
In San Francisco, an “anti-mask league” formed in opposition to a city mandate in the third wave early in 1919. Eventually, city leaders ended the mandate.
“There were even bombings in response to mask mandates,” Smoak said.
Also, just like people in 2020 are searching for ways to boost their immune systems and mitigate any impact the coronavirus might have on them, people in 1918-19 shared all kinds of home cures and remedies, some of which are remarkably similar.
Among those, gargling with disinfectant or breathing in eucalyptus oil or camphor oil, the main ingredient in Vicks Vapor Rub, Barry’s book says.
Distrust and fear
Dunn understands why some people might feel like they’re getting conflicting information.
“Anytime we have a new virus circulating, the information and our knowledge about it is going to change over time,” she said. “Some people see that as being dishonest, when in reality, it’s just that we’ve learned new things.”
In 2020, political leaders, both locally and nationally, have attempted to earn public trust with regular press conferences. This is a stark contrast to how the outbreaks in 1918 and 1919 were handled.
In 1918, Wilson was convinced that the public wouldn’t support the war effort unless the newspapers did, Barry wrote. Therefore, Congress enacted laws that punished anyone who spoke against the war effort, and the press was heavily censored. Wilson never actually made a public statement about the influenza outbreak, which ultimately claimed the lives of an estimated 675,000 people.
The inability of the government to give the public honest information bred distrust and fear.
“So the problems presented by a pandemic are, obviously, immense,” Barry wrote in his afterword. “But the biggest problem lies in the relationship between governments and the truth. Part of the relationship requires political leaders to understand the truth — and to be able to handle the truth.”
The undermining of trust isn’t just an issue of trusting one’s own government. It’s an issue of trusting information collected by global groups.
Barry points out that while many governments were prepared for the 2009 pandemic, many political leaders ignored the plans. He said Mexico, Brazil and China all had issues with how they responded to the outbreak because they refused to acknowledge realities. Mexico ended up losing $9 billion because of its mishandling of the 2009 pandemic.
The void of information in 1918 led to many misunderstandings about how it started and how widely it spread. It’s now believed that nearly one-third of the world’s population was infected and 50 million people died.
Smoak points out that the reason the influenza outbreak was dubbed the “Spanish flu” was because Spain was neutral in World War I, and so its government didn’t censor media reports about the illness.
“Because Spain is neutral, there aren’t those controls over the press,” he said. “Information about the virus gets widely reported, hence the name the Spanish flu. It got tagged as the origin (of the outbreak), but it’s not. That’s related to censorship and control of the press.”
Influenza outbreaks among U.S., British and French troops wasn’t reported, and the realities of how it was transmitted around the world weren’t widely known until years later, according to Barry. The influenza outbreak is believed to have actually started in Kansas.
Conspiracy theories
During the Influenza pandemic there were a number of conspiracy theories, including the assertion that the Germans had created the virus to help them in the war, Barry’s book says. There was even suspicion of Bayer aspirin, and in some small towns, people with German surnames or accents were harassed, and one door-to-door salesman was even killed.
In 2020, the conspiracies also abound, starting with the assertion that the virus was made in a lab in Wuhan, China. Some of the theories include the involvement of Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, and former President Barack Obama.
So why do some find conspiracy theories more comforting than scientific theories or facts?
“Conspiracy theories are very comforting to people because they are simple explanations for complicated problems,” Smoak said. “They shift responsibility.”
He said Americans are uniquely susceptible to conspiracy theories.
“We’ve grown up with national mythology that teaches us American exceptionalism,” he said. “If something bad happens, it couldn’t be our fault. There has to be some other explanation for it. And these modern conspiracy theories also play into people’s ideas of science fiction — germs escaping from labs. People wouldn’t have thought about that in the 19th century.”
The truth, however, is often too simple to bring any comfort.
“The more simple answer is that this is a natural process that has occurred countless times throughout human history,” Smoak said, “and it will continue to occur.”
The poor and parades
Just like 2020, the hardest hit were the poorest, including migrant and communities of color. Because quarantine was key to controlling the outbreak 100 years ago, just as it is today, those who live in smaller, more crowded conditions often don’t have a way to separate the sick from the well.
Political unrest gripped the country in 1918, which was caused by Wilson’s decision to enter World War I, and in 2020, it is a racial reckoning. This can create a climate in which the loss of freedom, fear of illness and grief is caused by both human and economic losses.
Smoak said historians cringe when they hear, “Those who fail to study history are doomed to repeat it.”
“We wish that people could learn from history,” he said. “But memories do fade, and people move on.”
There are some marked differences as well. Unlike COVID-19 — which is most deadly to those over 65 and with underlying health problems — the influenza pandemic struck down those in their prime, between the ages of 20 and 45.
The influenza outbreak of 1918-19 brought about many changes, both in the way public health officials learned to handle infectious diseases and in what researchers hoping to isolate causes and cures learned through their work, Barry noted.
“The experience of 1918 put in place certain health care infrastructure,” Smoak said. “Influenza wasn’t a reportable disease in 1918.”
Dunn said despite the fact that officials are grappling with some of the same issues, there were many lessons learned by the medical community that had an impact on containing COVID-19 outbreaks in America.
“One direct parallel is not to allow parades” in Utah this year, Dunn said. “When we were thinking of guidelines, parades came up so much. We just kept going back to 1918, and saying, ‘We cannot repeat this and have a surge because of a parade.’
“Very specific examples like that have helped.”
On Sept. 28, 1918, a parade held to support an effort to sell war bonds caused an explosion of the virus, which made its way to the cities through the movement of U.S. troops, most likely the Navy. Even as Philadelphia health officials were warning that people should avoid crowds, politicians refused to cancel the parade, according to Barry’s book.
Two days before the parade, hospitals admitted about 200 people suffering from influenza — 123 of those were civilians. Three days after the parade, every single bed in the city’s 31 hospitals was filled. Philadelphia would become one of the hardest hit cities, as the epidemic exploded from a few hundred civilian cases to hundreds of thousands of cases, Barry noted. Hundreds died every day, and even as officials were quoted in papers saying the epidemic had peaked, new records of sick and dying were recorded.
But it wasn’t just learning lessons on how the virus spread.
Barry pointed out that the number of people who rely on restaurants for food doubled in the century between the influenza outbreak and the writing of his book. As he points out, if all of those restaurants shut down, which they did during 2020’s COVID-19 outbreak, it would do much more damage to the economy than it did in 1918-19.
Barry also noted that the globalization of the economy means the supply chain could be very easily interrupted, and suggested the U.S. needed to look at producing more medical supplies, including vaccines, in the U.S.
Because hospitals are now run like businesses, there are actually fewer hospital beds per capita than there were in 1918, he said. It is not profitable to have empty hospital beds, so most facilities only have as many beds as they can utilize.
That, he said, could be a problem in a future pandemic, especially when it came to intensive care unit beds — an issue that was illustrated when COVID-19 numbers spiked in New York and New Jersey.
Some of the most ominous warnings had to do with health care, including the development and stockpile of vaccines and viral treatments.
“Of course, if developing a universal vaccine (for influenza types) were easy, it would have been done, but for decades few resources went to such research,” he wrote. Barry said the U.S. government doesn’t always spend its money wisely.
He said prior to the emergence of H5N1 — or bird flu — the U.S. government was spending more money on West Nile virus, which in its “deadliest year killed 284.” Influenza, on the other hand, was killing as many as 56,000 Americans.
That’s changed, but he said influenza deserves even more research money and effort than it receives today.
Dunn said public health is chronically underfunded in most places, in part because it’s easy to forget about how critical it is when there are no major issues.
And 2020 isn’t without its lessons.
Dunn said public health officials and politicians are learning that they have to work together to help people understand how to best care for each other when it comes to infectious disease.
“It reinforced the need to form good partnerships with the public before a pandemic hits,” she said. “When we are faced with a really big health threat, you already have that baseline of trust to build on. You’re not doing it in the middle of a crisis.”
Barry’s closing sentiments underscore why it is so critical that political leaders earn and keep public trust.
“As horrific as the disease itself was, public officials and the media helped create the terror — not by exaggerating the disease but by minimizing it, by trying to reassure,” he said.
“If there is a single dominant lesson from 1918, it’s that governments need to tell the truth in a crisis. ... You don’t manage the truth. You tell the truth.”
Lastly, Barry admonished ordinary people not to let their fear in a pandemic undermine their humanity.
“As Victor Vaughan — a careful man, a measured man, a man who did not overstate to make a point — warned, civilization could have disappeared within a few more weeks,” he wrote. “So the final lesson of 1918, a simple one yet one most difficult to execute, is that those who occupy positions of authority must lessen the panic that can alienate all within a society.
“Society cannot function if it is every man for himself. By definition, civilization cannot survive that.”",2020-08-10T00:33:00Z,2020,3,6
https://www.deseret.com/utah/2020/8/21/21376425/utah-leads-the-nation-with-lowest-jobless-rate-at-4-5/,Utah leads the nation with lowest jobless rate at 4.5%,Deseret News,2020-08-21T19:03:21Z,"SALT LAKE CITY — Despite the economic challenges brought on by the coronavirus outbreak, Utah is leading the way back to employment stability with the lowest unemployment rate in the country.
The state Department of Workforce Services Friday reported that July’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate registered at an estimated 4.5%, down from a revised 5.3% the previous month.
Nationally, July unemployment registered at 10.2%.
“July’s employment assessment is a third consecutive month of Utah employment improvement,” according to Mark Knold, chief economist at the Department of Workforce Services. “While the pace of job gains moderated a bit compared to the prior two months, the Utah economy is rebounding with vigor.”
According to DWS, approximately 72,900 Utahns were considered unemployed last month. The. state’s nonfarm payroll employment for July shrunk by an estimated 1.8%, with 27,500 jobs lost compared to the same month last year. Currently, 1,516,800 Utahns are considered gainfully employed.
But Knold stopped short of describing the state economy as strong, “because the job count is still on the negative side of the ledger.”
“In other words, we have fewer people in jobs now than we did this time last year. In a 12-month (analysis), we still have a lot of room to improve,” he said. “We’ve improved a lot. We had that hit the bottom there in April and we’ve had a pretty strong bounce back since then, but the bounce back still has a ways to go before I would say that we have shaken off the effects of COVID completely.”
He said until there is a vaccine, the state’s employment numbers will likely continue lagging a bit behind the position it was in before the pandemic. In the meantime, he noted that there seems to be three tiers of success thus far among various industries.
“The first category would be construction. It didn’t even really slow down at all because of COVID. That’s because it can social distance and still do its job, so to speak,” Knold said. “An example of industries that were hurt but made some bounce back would be the retail trade sectors. The third category would be those leisure and hospitality jobs. Restaurants are open, but they’re not at the levels they were before. Theaters are still shut down. Some of those other kinds of entertainment activities are still shut down. There’s no (Salt Lake) Bees baseball and so on.”
The monthly report showed Utah’s private sector employment for July maintained its positive trajectory with four of 10 groups measured posting net job gains for the month — up from three in June. The biggest gains were in construction, which added 7,900 jobs; trade, transportation and utilities adding 3,900 new positions, followed by financial services bringing on 3,000 new hires. To the contrary, six industry groups posted employment declines, with the largest drops occurring in leisure and hospitality, which lost 30,000 jobs; education and health care, down 6,800 workers; and professional and business services losing 6,200 positions.
Knold said employment will likely remain fairly stable for the next several months, barring a resurgence of COVID-19 or other unforeseen outside influence.
“I think you’re going to start to get some leveling off here at around (4.5%) as we go through the next couple of months,” he said. “Another way of saying it is over the last four months, the unemployment rate improved quickly and dramatically. The job growth rate improved quickly and dramatically. I don’t anticipate over the next couple of months that it will continue to improve dramatically.”
“What I’m anticipating over 2020 and by the end of 2021, if I go back before COVID, I anticipated the economy (would) probably only have grown about 1 1/2% over the two year time period. So in between you have a bit of a roller coaster — you have 2020 and this decline, 2021 looks like you’re getting some strong job growth because you’re comparing it back against COVID (the year before),” Knold explained. “But when you smooth it all out by the end of 2021 (and compare it) against the end of 2019, we probably will only have about 1 1/2% to 2% job growth — for Utah, that’s low.”
“It’s probably not keeping pace with the labor force growth, but we’ll make it up farther down the road. We generally do, but it’s just a matter of sticking with what generally happens (and) having faith in the economy,” he said. “You have to be patient and give it time to get back on its feet and get caught back up.”

https://www.deseret.com/opinion/2020/9/2/21417242/new-teacher-tiktok-challenge-parents-cyberullying-school-online/,A TikTok challenge that could test how mean some parents are,Deseret News,2020-09-02T15:00:00Z,"I’ve been hearing about increased cyberbullying recently, as children started spending astronomically more time online to do school classes that way amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Among other things, I heard some kids were using the chat feature during class to make fun of other kids. Disappointing, but not a big surprise.
The shocker for me was learning that some of the most cruel behavior online comes from parents.
And they’re high-fiving each other because they think that they’re funny,
The parents have been taking the “New Teacher Challenge” on TikTok, a viral goof-fest that’s supposed to be funny — and might actually be funny if it hadn’t strayed into territory that can only be described as ignorant and unkind.
The challenges goes something like this: As a parent, you pretend to be having a teleconference with your child’s new teacher. Then you invite the child over for a brief online meet and greet. But instead of meeting an actual teacher, the child is confronted with a scary or goofy image. The purpose is to record the child’s reaction and then share it for the pleasure of your social media friends.
The viral challenge got most of its attention, though, because thoughtless parents have been using pictures of real people who have disabilities or who have been burned or injured in ways that alter their appearance.
The key thought here is real people. People just like the rest of us with feelings, who don’t want how they look to be misused. And teaching kids to gasp or squeal or laugh or cry at someone’s appearance is a really lousy thing to do and a poor lesson to offer a child.
It’s hard to fix the problem once it goes online. Years ago, I wrote about a young man who had severe developmental disabilities. Not long after, I was alerted that someone had pirated the photo that ran with the article and it was being used in anti-vaccine memes, making him the inadvertent poster boy for what supposedly happens if your child is vaccinated, though vaccines had nothing to do with his disability, nor did he or his family give permission to use his image in that dishonest way.
Absent great skill with makeup, most of us just look how we look. If I controlled how I look, believe me when I say I’d be taller and more svelte, with thick dark locks and piercing blue eyes. And my chin would look considerably less like a scoop.
We all have features we would alter if we could wave a wand to change them, so I cannot understand two things about this imbecilic challenge: Why would you treat how actual people look with such callous disregard? Especially when it makes you look bad, not the person in the photo.
And why on earth would you want to scare children right now about school anyway? With so much of school’s joy buried — the drudgery part at the fore in this pandemic — with kids maneuvering carefully through the unknown, why make any aspect of it harder? A lot of kids are already so sad about lost activities and the challenges that it seems more-than-petty to add a moment’s burden to their load.
But folks who can’t be dissuaded from scaring kids for kicks could absolutely find other, less cruel ways to do it. Use a photo of a clown and get a shocked laugh instead of tears.

The most common is a raw number of new cases diagnosed daily, which clearly shows a surge since the beginning of the school year. The state reported its highest single-day increase on Friday with 1,117 new cases.
But other measures put Utah in a relatively favorable light. The state may rank 25th nationally in terms of cases per capita, but it ranks 45th in deaths per capita, according to worldometers.info. That reflects a young and mostly healthy population.
The CDC reports that Utah’s hospitalization rate peaked on July 11 at a rate of 8.6 per 100,000 population, then began to fall. It was down to 3.7 as of Sept. 12.
In short, there are statistics to justify almost any point of view.
But people who parse things this way are only kidding themselves. As Gov. Gary Herbert made clear on Thursday, the state’s current surge is a result of people not taking COVID-19 seriously enough, and the consequences for that are unacceptable.
As cases rise, hospitalizations and deaths follow a few weeks later. Those figures lag the daily new-case numbers.
Young people may feel invulnerable. They may look at statistics for their age demographic and figure they can throw caution to the wind with little worry. They may face social pressure to be reckless. But, as the governor said, their mild infections easily spread to older, more vulnerable people whose infections end up much more serious.
Ask yourself, how many more such deaths in Utah are acceptable? If the answer is anything above zero, your priorities are wrong.
If you refuse to wear a mask or are getting tired of all the rules, ask yourself, who are you liable to hurt? How many of your older friends and loved ones are expendable?
Dr. Thomas Tsai, a surgeon and health policy researcher at Harvard University, told CNBC on Friday that following the oft-repeated advice about hygiene, masks and social distancing remains the best way to control the virus, but these measures must be followed over a long, sustained period.
Humans tend to tire quickly. Pandemic fatigue sets in. But this is a long fight.
“We all want to find heroes and villains, and what we’ve learned from this pandemic is that there are no shortcuts,” Tsai was quoted as saying. “The countries that have done well have had sustained surveillance and testing and contact tracing and masking and physical distancing and even intermittent shutdowns for six months.”
He was addressing a recent resurgence in European countries that thought they had the pandemic licked. The truth is that, until a reliable vaccine is available and obtained by a large percentage of people, the best any state or nation can do is to contain it through proper action.
That’s no longer happening in Utah.
Health officials say 40% of Utah’s new cases come from Utah County, home to two large universities. But the surge is evident statewide.
Dr. Eddie Stenehjem, an infectious diseases physician with Intermountain Healthcare, added this warning on Thursday: If Utahns continue as they have been in recent weeks, “There will be a lot of really sick people and that will quickly outpace the resources.”
No one should find the current trajectory acceptable. Utahns need to rededicate themselves to wearing masks, social distancing and frequent hand washing. Until an effective vaccine is available, there is no other choice.",2020-09-19T04:00:00Z,2020,3,6
https://www.deseret.com/opinion/2020/9/8/21420341/guest-opinion-college-students-covid-19-fall-semester-2020-online-classes-gap-year/,Guest opinion: I’m supposed to be a college junior. I’m taking a semester off instead,Deseret News,2020-09-08T19:00:00Z,"For college students across the United States, this summer was wracked by the pressure of tough decisions. Many of us were forced to choose between either returning to an unrecognizable college experience or taking some time off. Facing the cost of tuition for a semester with a high chance of going virtual, I decided to press pause on my college education — and I wasn’t alone.
One in five students in America made the same decision to refrain from enrolling in a fall semester, generally choosing to work full time instead. Colleges with previously abundant sources of revenue from room and board and other on-campus expenses now find themselves fighting to survive the massive financial toll of COVID-19. Pandemic or no, the message is clear: Regardless of whether or not a vaccine is approved, colleges will have to reopen for in-person learning in the spring, or risk continued financial turmoil.
Right now, many colleges going ahead with on-campus learning aren’t doing so well. After all, the smallest rise in cases on campus could send students home at a moment’s notice. UNC Chapel Hill, after only six days of classes, reported that 130 students and five employees tested positive, and undergraduates were sent packing — a burdensome and time-consuming feat, especially for out-of-state students. The University of Alabama, which has over 500 on-campus cases, is facing the same decision. Some schools have already decided to shorten their fall semesters on campus, going completely virtual after Thanksgiving break.
In our yearning for on-campus learning and in our memory of the hasty end to spring 2020, younger college students poll more likely to see this fall semester as less valuable than the past. While there are many positives to online education, they are overshadowed by tuition costs that for many online didn’t see a reduction. In fact, 62% of schools online raised their tuition, a terrifying statistic. The reality is that many students are unwilling to pay full price for college outside of the brick and mortar classroom, or restricted indoors with a high likelihood of shifting to virtual learning.
Colleges would be wise not to overlook this, because there are simply too many other paths that students can take. Students deferring their college education have in overwhelming numbers reverted to working full time, choosing the fiscally responsible approach of saving in hopes of a spring return to regular on-campus learning. Others have chosen online education at a significantly lowered price through online community college courses or think-tank programs. A small percentage has even chosen volunteer work.
While every college student has a different financial situation, and financial aid and scholarships for many limit the ability to defer, the gap semester/gap year is a successful strategy for many college students. For many, the return to college amidst an unpredictable pandemic is a financial gamble, and an unfeasible long-term decision.
The restoration of on-campus learning in the spring is hopeful for many, and while it’s understandable that colleges work to act in the best interest of student’s health, students should be trusted to monitor their own well-being. After all, the fall attendance numbers show they’re certainly capable of monitoring their own financial health. Temporary alternatives to on-campus learning preventing the loss of hard-earned money have blossomed in the face of natural disaster. To win those students back, and to survive the long-term effects of the pandemic, colleges must reopen.

Think again,Deseret News,2020-12-18T05:00:46Z,"As a kid, Jeff Plate had a mean fastball and dreamed of a professional baseball career. Maybe he could become a pitcher for the New York Yankees, he thought.
But the farm boy from upstate New York eventually lost sight of this dream. At age 13, his hip popped out of joint. He underwent surgery and used crutches for months. And he was told to avoid sports for a while.
It was during this recovery period that the life-changing moment happened.
“I saw the band Kiss on television, and then sports didn’t matter anymore,” Plate recently told the Deseret News. “It just blew me into another orbit. They led the way and I followed.”
Now, Plate has been touring as the drummer for Trans-Siberian Orchestra for two decades.
From his seat on stage, he’s watched the arsenal of laser lights and pyrotechnics grow larger each year. He’s seen the bewildered looks on newcomers’ faces as they take it all in (it’s fairly easy for him to tell the longtime fans from the first-timers).
But no matter the reaction, by the time TSO gets to “Christmas Eve Sarajevo (12/24)” — the band’s signature song — Plate knows they’ve gained a new fan.
“That song gets people out of their chairs,” Plate said. “They applaud and next thing you know, we’ve got ’em.”
For years, Plate has marveled at how TSO’s fan base grows each year — to the extent that there’s separate East Coast and West Coast tours that cram eight shows into five days each week.
“We are a touring group like no other,” he said with a laugh.
In fact, since the band started touring in 1999, Plate — who typically takes part in the East Coast tour — recalls only one show that ever had to be rescheduled. A few years ago, a snowstorm in the Carolinas pushed back a performance. But nothing’s ever been canceled.
Until now.
When the pandemic hit, Plate recalls telling his wife: “Expect me to be around this year, ’cause I don’t see this going away.”
Over the following months, the musician roamed around his 85-acre farm in upstate New York. He shifted to teaching the drums to local kids virtually. He revived an original project, having more time to write, arrange and engineer music for his band Alta Reign, which has an album coming out in January.
But all the while, the possibility of a TSO tour lingered in his mind, however faint.
TSO held out as long as it could, hoping for a miracle.
“We were hoping to the last minute that something was going to break — be it a vaccine or be it COVID was just going to calm down for a little bit — and we were going to be able to at least do a tour of some respect,” Plate said. “This is the first time that anything has come along to really put a stop to our tour.”
So when push came to shove, TSO moved on to Plan B.
The band is putting together a 90-minute production of “Christmas Eve & Other Stories,” to be livestreamed from a soundstage in Nashville Dec. 18. Plate didn’t give too much away in terms of what the show will look like — although he did say incorporating fire and snow likely wouldn’t have the same effect as it does in person.
“If Paul was here, he would try to outfit everybody with a snow machine and a flame thrower of some sort,” the drummer said with a laugh.
Finding a way to keep the beloved tradition going in some form during a troubled year is a tribute to Paul O’Neill, the band’s creator who died unexpectedly in 2017. O’Neill’s dedication to the diverse music, stories, themes, special effects and energy of the shows lives on in all the TSO performers who strive to make every note count — even virtually.
“Everybody’s gonna really give it their all,” Plate said. “I mean, I would much rather be on tour, but I know this show is going to be great. Because in the spirit of what we do — in the spirit of Paul O’Neill — it has to be. We’re going to make it as big and as bright as we possibly can. And we’ll be right in your living room. You’ll have the best seat in the house.”",2020-12-18T05:00:46Z,2020,4,7

What’s going on?
Fauci, one of the nation’s top disease experts, spoke at a webinar hosted by think tank Chatham House about the coronavirus pandemic and how the vaccine could help life return to normal, CNBC reports.
He urged caution about celebrating the good news over the vaccine.
- “I think the opposite. ... I really do,” Fauci said. “The cavalry is coming but don’t put your weapons down, you better keep fighting because they are not here yet. Help is on the way, but it isn’t here yet.”
- “So to me, that is more of an incentive of, ‘Please don’t give up. Don’t despair, the end is in sight,’ as opposed to: ‘Hey, we are good to go, don’t worry about anything.’ We are not good to go. We have got to continue to double down on public health measures,” he added.
Vaccine in December:

Fauci said Tuesday that the coronavirus vaccine from Pfizer will likely be available for high-risk Americans in December, as I wrote about for the Deseret News.
- He said those without high risk conditions might need to wait until April.
- They’re going to dot all the i’s and cross all the t’s, but I believe with the impressive nature of the data that it should go through smoothly that by the time we get into December, we’ll be able to have doses available for people who are judged to be at the highest priority to get it first,” Fauci told MSNBC Tuesday.",2020-11-13T12:00:00Z,2020,4,7

“If you want to play sports, this is mandatory,” district spokesman Chris Williams said. “You have to be healthy to play.”
Two of the 168 members of the basketball, swimming, wrestling, drill or drama teams who were tested at Woods Cross High School tested positive on Wednesday. The rapid tests provided by the Davis County Health Department have results within 20 minutes and the two found to be infected were sent home.
Statewide, the Utah Department of Health reported more than 4,000 new COVID-19 cases Wednesday and another 17 Utahns died from the disease.
Williams said the school district’s entire team of 25 nurses is implementing the districtwide testing of student-athletes, making its way through all the high schools. Thursday, students at Bountiful High School will be tested and another on Monday, until all 2,000-plus student-athletes and coaching staff are tested.
Athlete testing will continue every two weeks to comply with Utah public health orders that indicate students must be tested to participate.
“It’s a big job,” Williams said.
Though if they’re following the current rules, students already feeling ill shouldn’t be at school, said the district’s nurse coordinator Margo Hill. She anticipated catching a couple asymptomatic cases.
“I think it would be disturbing to some of the students if they found out they have it through this,” she said, adding that contact tracing might also lead to disappointment among other team members.
“We want to do everything we can to make sure school is a healthy place,” Williams said.
All nine high schools within Davis County have experienced soft closures, which happens when 15 or more positive COVID-19 cases are identified among students who are attending school. Three of the district’s junior high schools have also been directed to online-only learning because of increasing number of COVID-19 cases among students.
Williams said two elementary schools in the district, Bluff Ridge and West Point, both in northern Davis County, will close tomorrow for two weeks.
Research opportunity
Utah’s COVID-19 patients have an opportunity to be some of the first to enroll in a worldwide study that will help determine preventive treatment for potential long-term complications of the disease.
“While there is a lot of excitement out there for vaccines, COVID-19 is not going away from our community anytime soon,” said Dr. Sarah Majercik, a trauma surgeon with Intermountain Healthcare and principal investigator of a study sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and Operation Warp Speed.
Intermountain is looking to enroll at least 700 patients between ages 40 and 80 who have tested positive with COVID-19 within the last two weeks and are willing to take a mild blood-thinning medication for 45 of the 75-day trial.
“The more knowledge we have, the more helpful it will be going forward,” Majercik said, adding that “a substantial proportion” of COVID-19 patients end up having long-term complications and those complications may be caused by blood clots brought on by the novel coronavirus.
“Inflammation in these patients is to a level we haven’t seen before with other disease profiles,” said Dr. Joseph Bledsoe, director of research in the department of emergency medicine at Intermountain Healthcare, who helped develop the study and bring it to Utah first.
Blood clots, he said, are a known complication of COVID-19, including in the brain, heart, lungs and legs, but microscopic blood clots have been found in autopsy reports of people who died from COVID-19, leading researchers to believe they might be worsening the effects of disease for some people.
“These are tiny clots that we can’t detect by traditional imaging methods but when in the lungs they may cause patients who are first seem stable to get much sicker quickly, have breathing difficulties, and potentially need a ventilator,” Majercik said. “Our aim in this study is to see if these drugs can stop clots from forming so patients who are not hospitalized never fall into this severe category of disease.”
She said the majority of Utahns with COVID-19 don’t end up in the hospital, which stands to benefit others, even save lives in the long-run.
To enroll in the new Intermountain study, patients need only email Intermountain clinical investigators at COVIDOutpatientTrials@imail.org. They will be sent a blood-thinning medication (either aspirin, Eliquis or a placebo) and can conduct all study-related business from home. Intermountain is covering the cost of the medications and is offering a $50 Amazon gift card to anyone who enrolls.
These medications were selected because they have already been proven safe and effective and are commonly used to prevent and treat blood clots in millions of patients every day, according to Bledsoe.
Patients are not advised to start taking blood-thinning medications on their own, however, the Intermountain doctors said. Majercik said the safest way to use blood-thinners to prevent problems would be to participate in the trial, which is under a doctor’s supervision.
Most of the ongoing COVID-19 related research looks at “the sickest of the sick,” she said, and this study is unique in that it focuses on patients who were not hospitalized with COVID-19. It is available to patients in an outpatient setting who maybe aren’t yet experiencing severe complications of the disease.
The goal is to see if some of that is preventable.
The knowledge gained from the study, Majercik said, could end up being a positive impact of the pandemic.
“This study is about our community,” Majercik said.
The 700 patients enrolled in the Intermountain study in Utah will make up a portion of the 7,000 enrolled across the United States and Canada.
Cases surge continues
The state health department reported 4,004 new cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday, after testing 9,434 additional people. More than 1.4 million people have been tested for the virus in Utah since mid-March, with 202,220 of them testing positive.
There are also 571 people hospitalized with COVID-19 throughout the state, according to the health department.
The rolling seven-day average number of new positive tests per day is 2,611, with an average percent positivity of 22.6%.
Among the latest deaths in Utah are 13 men and four women, bringing the total number of COVID-19-caused deaths to 906 in the state. Nationwide, more than 271,000 have succumbed to the rampantly spreading disease, with current surging case numbers happening in nearly every state.
Compared with other states, Utah has the 25th highest number of cases, 16,095, in the last seven days, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. California has had the highest, with 99,490 cases, and Vermont has had the lowest, with 493 reported in the last week.

“I forgot what day it was,” she says, as she runs up to join her husband and children, and her fellow townspeople in a circle, near the beginning of the fictional, horrifying short film, “The Lottery.”
“You wouldn’t have me leaving the dishes in the sink now would you Joe,” she says as she is greeted and shares a smile and a chuckle with her friends and those who are running the lottery.
Based on a 1948 short story from Shirley Jackson, this 18-minute film premiered in 1969 and has stuck with me decade after decade since I first viewed it with my classmates as a junior high school student in Northern California. In the film, old-timers in the town are clinging to their traditions, and among those traditions is holding the lottery, believing it’s necessary to ensure a good harvest.
I remember watching as each family drew lots from a black box. Every paper is blank, except for one marked by a black dot. Tessie’s husband drew the dot; each member of the Hutchison family — mom, dad and three young children — each now must draw again to see who among them will be selected.
The prize? The “winner” is stoned to death by the townspeople.
It’s horrifying even writing those words. What’s wrong with these people? Tessie is the unlucky one to draw the black dot. She lost the lottery and her family lost a mother. The movie is fiction, but it helped our young minds consider how wars start, how the Holocaust could have happened, and how behaviors are accepted even when irrational and leading to someone’s death.
The dark story — which was part of the “Short Story Showcase” by Britannica and designed to make people consider, among other things, their inhumanity toward each other, came to my mind earlier this week when Utah topped 1,000 deaths from COVID-19.
Each of those deceased lost the COVID-19 lottery. That sentence also feels too harsh to write. This is no movie. These are real people with real loved ones, and we ache for them. There is an inhumanity displayed by those failing to protect them — failing to make even the slightest adjustment to save their fellow townspeople.
“The number of Utahns who’ve died from COVID-19 exceeded the 1,000-mark Thursday, just two months after 500 deaths were reported. Even with a vaccine, that total is projected to double again in less than 10 weeks, to 2,000 deaths in the state,” wrote Deseret News reporter Lisa Riley Roche last week.
Is it asking too much to protect each other? Some people are yet willing to pick up that rock and hurl it at an unlucky passerby.
The idea appears absurd. But also absurd is getting behind the wheel of a car when you’ve been drinking, or refusing to do something as simple as keeping distance or wearing a small cloth over your face.
Inside the newsroom we have these conversations as we struggle to write stories that will actually influence change. Reporter Amy Donaldson wrote about Navy veteran Victor Hammond, whose family took to the streets to try and convince anti-mask citizens to consider his story.
Deseret News reporter Ashley Imlay and KSL’s Garna Mejia told the story of Charity Montoya, a 41-year-old wife and mother who worked as a study director at a Salt Lake City laboratory.
“It was just bad luck of the draw, unfortunately,” said her husband, Rudy Montoya, when he talked to our reporters. “We don’t know who brought it home, but once it hit, it hit all of us. Her mother had to go to the emergency room, her sister was in ICU for a time as well, and it seemed like we were doing fine,” he recalled.
In March, Utah learned of the passing of Robert Garff, “the chairman of a car dealership conglomerate founded by his father and a former Utah House speaker who died Sunday from complications due to the new coronavirus,” as Riley Roche reported in the Deseret News at the time.
“The new coronavirus.” That’s what it was called then. It’s not new anymore.
There was good news Saturday, following an emergency meeting of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention covered by Sara Israelsen-Hartley of the Deseret News. She’s been our go-to expert on vaccines — the approval process and what it will take to distribute in Utah.
Vaccines will begin to be distributed in Utah and across the nation, on Monday for health care workers and other emergency first responders. Full distribution will take time. So the virus isn’t going away. And some will need to be convinced to do their part for the community by taking the vaccine. Masks will still be required, probably through summer.
The stories we want to tell are those about people doing their part — like the health care workers that have been working nonstop, many isolated from their own families. They are more than doing their part; nearly 6,000 workers in Utah’s health care industry have been infected by COVID-19.
It is not too late to do the right thing. And Rudy Montoya, who lost his wife, said it eloquently in words we can all relate to:

What’s happening?
Fauci said at Yahoo Finance’s All Markets Summit Monday that the coronavirus vaccines developed early on might be made to prevent symptoms rather than block out the entire virus.
- “The primary thing you want to do is that if people get infected, prevent them from getting sick, and if you prevent them from getting sick, you will ultimately prevent them from getting seriously ill.”
- “What I would settle for, and all of my colleagues would settle for, is the primary endpoint to prevent clinically recognizable disease.”
Preventing the coronavirus overall is the primary goal, he said. But that’s a tough call to answer when the entire world is rushing to have a vaccine to get people back to some sense of normalcy.
When will the vaccine be available?
Two government officials recently said at a forum from the Heritage Foundation that the government plans to have hundreds of millions of doses of the COVID-19 vaccine that will be distributed within the three first months of next year, according to The Washington Post.
- “We are on the brink of seeing the fruits of our labor,” said Gen. Gustave Perna, chief operating officer for Operation Warp Speed, according to The Washington Post.",2020-10-29T01:30:00Z,2020,4,7

Mitt Romney said Sunday he sees the recently-discovered cyber hack against the U.S. as a form of cyber warfare that could “cripple us” as a country, and he believes President Donald Trump has a “blind spot” for Russia.
Romney also said in a pair of appearances on network news programs on Sunday that he is “disappointed” in the president for speculating that someone other than Russia is responsible for the cyber hack.
Trump tweeted on Saturday that news reports of the cyber hack have been overblown and that “everything is well under control.”
The president also speculated that the hacks could have come from China, despite federal law enforcement officials and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blaming Russia for the hacks that went on for at least nine months undetected before officials discovered them last weekend.
“Russia, Russia, Russia is the priority chant when anything happens because Lamestream is, for mostly financial reasons, petrified of discussing the possibility that it may be China (it may!). There could also have been a hit on our ridiculous voting machines during the election, which is now obvious that I won big, making it an even more corrupted embarrassment for the USA,” Trump tweeted Saturday.
Romney said Russia’s actions require a response.
“This demands a response, and the response you’d expect to occur would be a cyber response. I don’t know if we have the capacity to do that in a way that would be in the same scale or an even greater scale to what Russia has applied to us, but this is something we have to address as soon as possible,” Romney said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
“But I think we’ve come to recognize that the president has a blind spot when it comes to Russia. And the reality here is that the experts, the people who really understand how our systems work and how computers work and software and so forth, that thousands upon thousands of the CIA and the NSA and the Department of Defense have determined that this came from Russia,” he said.
When asked whether the cyber hack was an act of war or espionage, Romney noted it gave Russia the ability to take out essential utilities in the country.
He likened the move to what the U.S. did during the Iraq War when it disabled communication towers in Baghdad.
“Well, what Russia has done is put in place a capacity to potentially cripple us, in terms of our electricity, our water, our communications. I mean, this is the same sort of thing one can do in a wartime setting,” Romney said on the NBC program.
Through the hack, Russia accessed the agency responsible for the country’s nuclear weapons capacities and research, according to Romney.
Presidential election
When asked on CNN’s “State of the Union” how the Senate will respond to Trump’s recent reported efforts to have the election results overthrown, Romney said: “Well, it’s not going to happen. That’s going nowhere.”
“And I understand the president is casting about, trying to find some way to have a different result than the one that was delivered by the American people. But it’s really sad in a lot of respects, and embarrassing, because the president could right now be writing the last chapter of this administration with a victory lap with regards to the vaccine,” Romney said.
While the vaccine approvals were an “extraordinary success” for the president, he is instead posting conspiracy theories “and things that are so nutty and loopy that people are shaking their head, wondering, ‘What in the world has gotten into this man?’ And I think that’s unfortunate, because he has more accomplishments than this last chapter suggests he’s going to be known for,” Romney said on the CNN show.
The Republican Party has “changed pretty dramatically,” Romney said.
“And by that I mean that the people who consider themselves Republican and voted for President Trump I think is a different cohort than the cohort that voted for me. Not entirely of course, but in many respects,” he said.
He said the party is trying to see “who could be the most like President Trump” for the 2024 race.
“There’ll be some differences in personality, but I think the direction you’re seeing is one he set out and I don’t see a different course being considered by those who are looking for 2024,” Romney said.
“I’d like to see a different version of the Republican Party, but my side is very small these days,” he said, noting he believes the party will eventually “gravitate back to the principles that formed it,” including “pushing back on nations like Russia, authoritarian regimes,” balancing the budget, and welcoming legal immigration.
Despite seeing himself as an outlier in the Republican Party, Romney said he doesn’t plan on leaving it as some others in Congress have done.
“I think I’m more effective in the Republican Party, continuing to battle for the things I believe in,” the senator said on “State of the Union.”
“And I think, ultimately, the Republican Party will return to the roots that have been formed over the — well, the century. So, we will get back at some point. And hopefully, people will recognize we need to take a different course than the one we’re on right now.”",2020-12-20T20:59:50Z,2020,4,7

- “Herd immunity is achieved by protecting people from a virus, not by exposing them to it,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a virtual press briefing.
- He said “herd immunity is a concept used for vaccination, in which a population can be protected from a certain virus if a threshold of vaccination is reached.”
The WHO leader pointed to measles. About 95% of people are vaccinated for measles so the leftover 5% would be protected from the virus, according to CBS News.
- “Never in the history of public health has herd immunity been used as a strategy for responding to an outbreak, let alone a pandemic.”
For the novel coronavirus, 70% to 90% of Americans would need to have coronavirus antibodies for herd immunity to be achieved, according to CBS News.

What does it mean for Disneyland?,Deseret News,2020-10-20T21:10:06Z,"Disneyland and Universal Studios will have to wait a little longer before they can reopen during the coronavirus pandemic.
What’s going on?
- California officials released new guidelines Tuesday that allow large theme parks to reopen in least-restrictive, fourth level, yellow tier counties in the state, KABC reports.
- Capacity in those locations will be limited to 25%.
- Smaller theme parks can reopen in the orange (or third) level tier.
- Ticket sales to outdoor sporting events will be kept to those within a 120-mile radius of the outdoor stadiums, which can reopen when the county reaches an orange tier.
Why it means for Disneyland:
Disneyland is located in Anaheim, California, which is in Orange County.
Dr. Clayton Chau, the director of the Orange County Health Care Agency, said in a statement to the Deseret News that he sees Orange County reaching the yellow tier by 2021.
- “I think for a large county like us, especially a county with institution of higher education where folks (are) coming in from outside the county and outside the state, I think it’s going to be very hard to achieve the yellow tier,” he said.
- “It depends on when the vaccine will come as well as how many doses (are) available for our populations as well as how many of our residents will readily accept the vaccine — those are the three factors that will determine how soon we can get to the yellow tier.”
- “Personally, I think that we can look forward to a yellow tier by next summer, hopefully. Hopefully.”

Ken Potrock, the president of Disneyland Resort, slammed the new guidelines in a statement to the Deseret News.
- “We have proven that we can responsibly reopen, with science-based health and safety protocols strictly enforced at our theme park properties around the world. Nevertheless, the state of California continues to ignore this fact, instead mandating arbitrary guidelines that it knows are unworkable and that hold us to a standard vastly different from other reopened businesses and state-operated facilities. Together with our labor unions we want to get people back to work, but these state guidelines will keep us shuttered for the foreseeable future, forcing thousands more people out of work, leading to the inevitable closure of small family-owned businesses, and irreparably devastating the Anaheim/Southern California community.”",2020-10-20T21:10:06Z,2020,4,7

What’s happening:
Scientists from the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group told reporters this week that children may be more susceptible to the new COVID-19 strain than they were to the original COVID-19 strain, the New York Post reports.
- “There is a hint that it is has a higher propensity to infect children,” said NERVTAG member Neil Ferguson, a professor from Imperial College London, according to The Independent.
Wendy Barclay, a NERVTAG professor and a specialist in virology, told reporters the new mutations have a different way of entering human cells, which means “children are, perhaps, equally susceptible to this virus as adults.”
- “We’re not saying that this is a virus which specifically targets children,” she said. But, she added, it puts adults and children on the same plane as far as being infected, according to the New York Post.
Is the UK variant in the U.S.?
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a release Tuesday that the new COVID-19 variant may already be in the U.S., prompting experts to worry about whether the COVID-19 vaccine will work as effectively against the new mutation, as I wrote about for the Deseret News.
- “Ongoing travel between the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as the high prevalence of this variant among current UK infections, increase the likelihood of importation,” the CDC said in a statement. “Given the small fraction of U.S. infections that have been sequenced, the variant could already be in the United States without having been detected.”",2020-12-23T21:00:00Z,2020,4,7

Lawmakers insist they’ll find compromise before leaving Washington Dec. 21 for the holidays.
White House negotiator Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin offered Democrats a $916 billion package that would include a second round of individual stimulus checks, The Associates Press reported.
Tuesday’s nearly trillion dollar offer, which is $8 billion higher than last week’s bipartisan proposal, also includes liability protection for businesses operating during the pandemic and funding for state and local governments, according to Politico.
What the White House offer lacks, and could be a deal breaker for some lawmakers, is a $300 weekly federal unemployment benefit that was included in the bipartisan proposal, according to the AP.
Referring to the $908 billion bipartisan proposal Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said liability protections and state and local aid could be dropped and renegotiated next year, Politico reported. The article said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., accused McConnell of “sabotaging” negotiations,
Here’s what Congress and the Trump administration are negotiating:
More stimulus checks
Mnuchin’s offer to lawmakers includes funding for $600 individual stimulus checks to Americans.
That’s half the amount provided in March’s Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, which included $1,200 checks, but is more than last week’s bipartisan proposal, which lacked individual payments.
President Donald Trump and lawmakers on both sides of the political divide — like Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders — wanted any new coronavirus stimulus package to include individual checks, Politico reported.
Federal unemployment assistance
While Mnuchin’s offer includes language and some funding for unemployment aid, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, and Schumer both said an aid cut from $180 billion to $40 billion was “unacceptable,” The New York Times reported.
The White House offer also wouldn’t extended the $300 weekly federal unemployment benefit.
The bipartisan proposal “would extend unemployment insurance programs that are set to expire at the end of the month for 16 weeks, and provide a $300 per week federal boost to benefits from the end of December into April,” according to The Hill.
Business liability protections and other government aid
Liability protections for businesses open during the pandemic had been a “red line” issue for McConnell, who previously fought for the language, Politico reported, but the majority leader suggested Tuesday that talks around the issue could begin again next year if it meant passing a new package before the holiday recess.
Leaders from both parties have said that they wouldn’t leave for the holiday recess — scheduled to begin Dec. 21 — until a deal was reached.
State and local government aid is included in both the bipartisan proposal and the White House offer.
According to a summary of the bipartisan proposal obtained by The Hill, liability protections and $160 billion for state and local governments are included. The summary said legislators agreed on the principles of both issues “as the basis for good faith negotiations.”
The Hill’s copy of the proposal summary also includes:
- A second round of Payroll Protection Program loans for businesses that “have 300 or fewer employees and had revenue loss of 30% in any quarter in 2020,” allows local chambers of commerce to apply for PPP, adds business expenses that can be forgiven under the loan and sets aside loans for the “smallest businesses and businesses in underserved communities.”
- Eviction moratoriums though January 2021.
- $25 billion in rental assistance to state, local and tribal governments.
- Student loan forbearance though April 2021.
- Funding for health care and education workers.
- Money for vaccine development, testing and tracing.
- Funds for food assistance.",2020-12-09T20:59:52Z,2020,4,7

Mayors from eight Southern California cities are pushing for Gov. Gavin Newsom to reopen theme parks sooner rather than later.
- Mayors from Anaheim, Los Angeles, Riverside, Santa Ana, San Jose, Bakersfield, Fresno and San Diego sent Newsom a letter asking him to allow theme parks to reopen sooner than the state guidelines allow, according to KABC.
- The mayors suggest that the guidelines mean the major theme parks could be closed for more than a year. Thousands of jobs and economic recovery could be at stake.
- The letter requested Newsom to work with a coalition to discuss reopening theme parks with reduced capacity.
Flashback:
California officials released official guidelines for theme parks to reopen at the end of October, which I wrote about for Deseret News. The guidelines suggest parks can only reopen when the countries they’re in hit the least-restrictive, fourth level, yellow tier.
Dr. Clayton Chau, the director of the Orange County Health Care Agency, said in a statement to the Deseret News that it’s unlikely Orange County — where Disneyland is located — will get there anytime soon.

“Seeing our leaders get vaccinated gives people faith in terms of the science and in terms of the safety of this vaccine. This pandemic has been highly politicized, so it’s great to see people on both sides of the aisle getting vaccinated in a public display,” said Intermountain Healthcare infectious disease specialist Dr. Eddie Stenehjem.
The same day the vice president drew new attention to the vaccine, Utah reported 2,644 new coronavirus cases and 14 more deaths. The rolling seven-day averages for positive tests is 2,494 per day, and the percent of positive laboratory tests is 22.12%.
Pence, wearing a mask, received the shot in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building near the White House Friday. Afterward, he declared “I didn’t feel a thing. Well done,” and called the Pfizer vaccine he received and the Moderna drug that was given final approval later in the day “a medical miracle.”
The vice president said he and his wife, second lady Karen Pence, “wanted to step forward and take this vaccine to assure the American people that while we cut red tape, we cut no corners” in speeding up the development of the vaccine from what usually takes eight to 12 years to just months.
“Thanks to the great work at the National Institutes of Health, and the great and careful work of the FDA and the leadership of our president and Operation Warp Speed, the American people can be confident we have one, and perhaps within hours, two safe and effective coronavirus vaccines for you and for your family,” Pence said.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., both also received the vaccine on Friday.
Utah Sen. Mitt Romney was vaccinated, too.
“The attending physician’s office has now informed all senators that for continuity of government purposes, we are to receive vaccinations, and that there is no reason to delay,” Romney, a Republican, said in a statement Friday.
“In accordance with this directive, I will receive the vaccine. I will also continue to wear a mask, practice social distancing and avoid large gatherings in line with public health guidance,” Romney said, later tweeting a photo of himself receiving a shot while wearing a mask.
Earlier this week, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, tweeted that he looks “forward to getting it after those most vulnerable and the heroic front line workers have the opportunity.”
Rep. John Curtis, R-Utah, also tweeted earlier this week about the vaccine, saying he has “full confidence and will gratefully take it when it’s my turn — after healthcare workers such as my wife Sue, and other essential workers who have made sacrifices and carried our country on their backs this year.”
Curtis told KSL Newsradio’s Lee Lonsberry Friday that it’s “a shame” the vaccine has become political.
“What could be more crazy than to get to this point and have the remedy, the cure, for this, and people not being willing to take it? It just adds to the craziness of this year,” Curtis said, adding that he’s encouraging people to be vaccinated because “there’s too much at stake not to do it.”
Fewer vaccine doses than expected are headed to Utah as part of the initial allocation, the Utah Department of Health said in a tweet Friday. A number of other states have already said they’ve been told their upcoming shipments would be reduced but federal officials have said that’s not correct.
“Like many other states, this afternoon we learned we will be receiving fewer doses of the Pfizer vaccine next week than we were planning for. 16,575 doses instead of the 23,400 we were planning for. Working now to figure out why,” the Utah health department tweet stated.
The first vaccine doses arrived in Utah Monday, at two Intermountain Healthcare hospitals, and the immunization of the most at-risk front-line health care workers there and at University of Utah Health began a day later. Both hospital systems publicized the first shots given to employees.
Stenehjem, who treats COVID-19 patients, said he was vaccinated Thursday.
“I’m feeling actually pretty well,” he told reporters during a virtual news conference, describing some muscle fatigue and tiredness, but not enough to keep him from shoveling snow Friday morning. He said his colleagues who have been vaccinated have not reported any serious side effects.
“From our standpoint, the reason that we wanted to be vocal about us being vaccinated is that we’re the people that know the most about the trials and the science behind this vaccine. We’ve looked under the hood. We’ve pored over the data,” Stenehjem said, and believe both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are safe.
“As a way to demonstrate that to people, we wanted to be very vocal and visual about us getting the vaccine. I certainly don’t want to take an unsafe vaccine and so if I thought it was unsafe, I wouldn’t take it. This is a safe and effective vaccine. I’m hoping this is one way for us to demonstrate our faith, and our faith in science.”
Even before the first of what will be two vaccine doses 21 days apart were administered, he said national surveys were showing an increase in the number of Americans who say they’ll be vaccinated, from about half of the country to around 70%.
Stenehjem said he hopes seeing people getting the shots will boost those numbers even more.
Utah reported a record 30 deaths Thursday from the coronavirus, the result of a pre-Thanksgiving surge in the state, Stenehjem said. While the state has not seen that rapid climb in cases from Thanksgiving, the doctor urged Utahns to avoid gatherings outside their homes over Christmas and other holidays in December and January.
That, combined with ramping up vaccinations to include nursing home patients and staff, then teachers, should help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the most vulnerable populations and ease the strain on already overcrowded hospitals as well as reduce the number of deaths.
The state has not yet spelled out who will get the vaccine after teachers.
But it could take months for the vaccine to be widely available so that enough Utahns can be vaccinated to reach the 70% threshold for herd immunity and stop the virus from spreading, Stenehjem said, calling between April and July “a realistic time frame.”
A total of 1,347 Utahns have received the vaccine as of Friday, nearly 1,000 more than the day before, according to the state. Currently, 539 people are hospitalized in the state with COVID-19 bringing the total number of hospitalizations since the outbreak began in March to 9,883.
There have been 246,562 positive COVID-19 cases in Utah and a total of 1,140 deaths. The deaths reported Friday are:
- A Carbon County man, between the ages of 65 and 84. Officials said it was unknown if he was hospitalized when he died.
- A Davis County woman, 65-84, hospitalized at time of death.
- An Emery County man, 65-84, not hospitalized at time of death.

https://www.deseret.com/utah/2020/11/18/21573379/coronavirus-covid19-vaccine-priority-program-daily-cases-deaths-hospitalizations-salt-lake-city/,"Most Utahns can expect COVID-19 vaccines by July, health official says",Deseret News,2020-11-18T20:54:32Z,"SALT LAKE CITY — Utah Gov.-elect Spencer Cox is optimistic that Utah “can get back to normal soon” with COVID-19 vaccines performing better than expected amid ongoing approval processes.
“All Utahns can anticipate a June or July time frame when they can start receiving the vaccine,” said Rich Lakin, director of immunizations at the Utah Department of Health.
That is, however, if everything goes as expected, he said.
Vaccines from major pharmaceutical manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna Therapeutics are approaching the final stages of approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and states have already submitted distribution plans, prioritizing who will get the first doses that become available, when they do.
Utah’s plan is “based on the honor code,” aside from the most in-demand hospitals, which will get the first doses that come to the state, Lakin said.
The plan is divided into phases, with waves of vaccine distribution based on the number of vaccines received, which is initially based on Utah’s share of the entire population of the United States.
The fact that both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses to be fully effective — 21 and 28 days apart, respectively — will also impact the number of people vaccinated.
“We’re estimating somewhere around 100,000 doses will come to Utah,” Lakin said during a meeting held Wednesday at the state’s Emergency Operations Center at the state Capitol.
Cases still surging
Meanwhile, another 3,071 new cases of COVID-19 were reported in Utah on Wednesday, bringing the state’s total number of known infections since mid-March to 162,028, the health department reports.
It estimates the rolling seven-day average number of new cases daily to be about 3,161, with a 24.1% positive test rate.
More than 1,278,951 people have been tested, including an increase of 13,251 from Tuesday.
Another nine deaths were reported by the health department on Wednesday, putting Utah’s COVID-19 death toll at 740 lives lost.
There are also 541 people currently hospitalized with COVID-19 throughout Utah, with 201 in intensive care units.
The health department reports that nearly 85% of all hospital beds are now being used, treating COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, indicating “major strains” on the health care system in Utah.
Hospital officials have said the greatest strain is on caregivers, many of whom are working extra shifts and extended hours to provide for the elevated demand for care.
Public health orders have been issued, including a mask mandate in effect statewide, until the surges in new cases can be calmed, particularly to avoid overwhelming the health care systems in the state.
More than a week into the latest provision, though, the numbers don’t appear to be letting up.
Hospitals first
Vaccines — most likely Pfizer’s will be available first — will first go to the five hospitals in the state that are experiencing the greatest burden from COVID-19, including LDS Hospital, University of Utah Hospital, Intermountain Medical Center, Utah Valley Hospital and Dixie Regional Medical Center.
It will be up to those health systems and hospital administrators to decide how the doses will be distributed within those hospitals.
Lakin said those doses should start to arrive in Utah before the end of this month, but won’t be able to be administered until FDA approval is granted. Pfizer’s vaccine also requires highly technical ultra-cold storage, minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit, to maintain its quality.
“It is very difficult to plan when we don’t know how much vaccine we will have,” Lakin said, adding that teams of people have met for months to determine the best path. “With limited doses, it will obviously impact how fast we can move the vaccinations to get everybody vaccinated.”
Once those high-risk hospital personnel are inoculated, and more vaccines become available, doses will be distributed to other hospitals, long-term care facilities and first responders.
At that point, Walgreens and CVS pharmacies will begin to receive vaccines as part of their partnerships with the federal government to help administer them to long-term care facility residents and others not previously vaccinated.
Lakin puts that happening in about February or March. He said long-term care facilities will be a top priority, as they’ve seen the highest number of cases and ongoing outbreaks.
From there, a coalition of community partners will have prioritized a list of occupations based on their risk levels and ability to work from home. Members of the general public will begin to have access to the vaccine, based on where they fall on that spectrum of risk.
Getting Utahns vaccinated
From March to July, Lakin estimates people over age 65 and those with underlying medical conditions, as well as harder-hit tribal entities and ethnic groups, will have access to the COVID-19 vaccine, depending on how many doses are available.
And after the greatest risks have been taken care of, then all Utahns will have the opportunity to be vaccinated against the novel coronavirus that has been impacting nearly every aspect of life since March.
“There will likely be sufficient supply in July of next year,” Lakin told members of the media. “I’m confident that all Utahns could start receiving the vaccine in July.”
Reports that the highly scrutinized COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective — Pfizer has reported 95% efficacy and Moderna 94.5% — have only heightened anticipation of their arrival, said Cox.
“This is really good news,” Lakin said.
Regardless of when COVID-19 vaccines become available, Lakin said it won’t mean face mask and social distancing recommendations will become obsolete.
“It doesn’t mean that the disease burden is eliminated,” he said. “Even though we’ll be vaccinating from December through July, we will still see a high rate of COVID-19 cases.”
“This is a marathon, not a sprint,” Lakin said, adding that probably 60% of all Utahns would need to be vaccinated to begin to see a difference.
Health department surveys have indicated that as many as 70% of Utahns are either very likely or are planning to get the vaccine when it becomes available.
“By the time we reach July, into this time next year, we should start to see a reduction in the disease burden ... but we still have to practice the same recommendations,” Lakin said.
The pending COVID-19 vaccines are intended only for people 18 and older at this point.

The Utah Department of Health said Thursday that 14,822 vaccines have been administered in the Beehive State. The news comes as the number of positive COVID-19 tests continues to climb, with the agency reporting 2,892 new cases on Thursday, bringing the state's overall number of infections to 260,589 since the pandemic arrived.
Another nine Utahns have died of the novel coronavirus, putting the state’s death toll at 1,204. One previous death has been removed from the total and is under further investigation, the health department said in its news release.
The first doses of COVID-19 vaccine produced by Pfizer arrived in Utah on Dec. 14, with the initial wave of medical personnel receiving inoculations the following day. Earlier this week, hospitals began receiving the Moderna vaccine as well.
Intermountain Healthcare began administering the COVID-19 vaccine at Heber Valley and Park City hospitals Wednesday — the first rural hospitals to administer the vaccine in Utah. Intermountain has vaccinated about 6,000 caregivers, it reported in a news release Wednesday.
Tessa Vasquez, Heber Valley Hospital medical-surgical nurse manager, was among the first recipients of the inoculation. She was optimistic about the impact the vaccine could have on the community, she said in a video released by Intermountain showing vaccinations being given.
“The vaccine for COVID is so important,” she said. “We have a lot of caregivers that are exposed to it on a daily basis, and this helps to keep them safe, helps to keep it from getting to their family in the community, and it helps them to be able to be here and not have to miss work because of being sick so that we have enough people to care for the community when they need it.”
Heber Valley Hospital emergency room physician Dr. Doug Vogel said he was very excited about this significant step in helping to mitigate the spread of the virus.
“I just think how often in the community we social distance, we wash our hands and we wear a mask. I can just think of how much fatigue there is in that,” he said. “Then I come to the emergency department where more and more the majority of patients I’m seeing are having cough, shortness of breath and fever, and I wear all the protective gear as do my colleagues. Getting the vaccine is just another line of defense so we can stay vigilant and continue doing what we’re doing, but at the same time just have the security that we’ve got another thing going for us.”
For Brittany Badeau, a pediatric intensive care unit nurse at Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City, being able to be vaccinated is a morale-boosting moment for herself and her colleagues.
”Watching all these other nurses lined up for something like this, the energy is great in here today and I feel like it’s hopefully the start of an end for us,” she said. “I feel really grateful to have this even available to me, and I highly encourage everyone else to get it as well.
“To just have something like this shows us the light at the end,” she added.
In Tooele County, the first group of medical professionals are expected to receive the Moderna vaccine beginning next week, a Mountain West Medical Center spokeswoman said.
The statewide rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine to other groups, beginning with long-term care facilities, will continue throughout the coming months.
Thursday’s numbers
The rolling seven-day average for positive tests is 2,379 per day, while the average for percent of positive laboratory tests registered at 24%.
There are currently 561 people hospitalized with the virus, increasing the total number of hospitalizations from the start of the outbreak to 10,406.

- Appointments have already begun to fill up across Utah, the Deseret News reported.
- The decision to open up vaccination will add about 1 million people to a list of those eligible for the vaccine.
Utah Department of Health spokesman Tom Hudachko told the Deseret News there’s no indication about how long it will take to vaccinate all of Utah.
How to book a vaccine appointment
You can look for appointments through links on Utah’s coronavirus.utah.gov website Tuesday.
- Booking an appointment can be done in multiple ways. You just need to contact your local health department to schedule your vaccination or you can book an appointment online through the coronavirus.utah.gov website. You can also ask any vaccination questions to your health department.
Things to know before you book a vaccine appointment
- People must schedule your appointment ahead of time.
- Don’t show up without an appointment.
- “Please understand we have limited vaccines and that appointments will fill up quickly. It may take a few tries to get an appointment,” according to the Utah coronavirus vaccine page.
What if you can’t find a vaccine appointment in Utah?
Hudachko, the spokesman for the Utah health department, told the Deseret News that those who can’t find an appointment should remain patient.
- “Each time we’ve opened eligibility to additional groups we’ve created more demand than we have supply. If somebody can’t find an appointment today, keep trying,” he said.
Davis County Health Department spokesman Trevor Warner said more vaccine opportunities may come soon.
- “If we somehow fall into extra vaccine, then appointments will be added and people could get in sooner, but that’s a big if.”

What’s going on?
Besser recently spoke on the “Today” show about the COVID-19 vaccine, suggesting that it’s a backup plan to stopping the virus.
- “We have to up the conversation on what is going to turn the tide on this pandemic this winter, and it’s not vaccine — the vaccine is the long game.”
He told “Today” that people should focus on wearing masks, washing their hands and staying away from others in order to stop the coronavirus right now.
- “If we don’t get people to double down on wearing masks and keeping apart and washing their hands and waiting their turn for when they should be getting vaccinated, we’re going to be at real risk, especially as this UK variant starts to spread more around the country. Any lapses in those public health recommendations, in our following of those, is going to cost us in a really big way.”
Dr. Birx had similar advice before
Back in August, Dr. Deborah Birx — one of the advisers on former President Donald Trump’s White House Coronavirus Task Force — said waiting for the COVID-19 vaccine wasn’t a great idea, either, as I wrote about for the Deseret News.
Birx said Americans can work now to stop the community spread of the coronavirus through public health measures.
- “Do the right thing today. Because if we do the right thing today, we go into the fall with much fewer cases.”
- “Right now, we gain freedom through wearing our masks and socially distancing.”",2021-01-28T03:15:00Z,2021,1,8

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox tweeted the announcement, calling it “an incredible milestone.”
It “speaks to the dedication of our public health teams and private partners. Thanks to everyone who stepped up in a historic way. We are just getting started,” he said.
Cox has been pushing hard to get more people vaccinated against COVID-19, but the state has struggled to get enough supply from manufacturers and the federal government to keep up with growing demand. Appointments for vaccines fill up quickly with Utah’s local health departments and partnering agencies, including grocery stores and pharmacies throughout the state.
The governor believes there will be enough vaccine in the state for every adult to be vaccinated be the end of April, which is a month earlier than the previously reported end of May availability.
Ramped up production and manufacturing processes have accelerated the delivery and administration of COVID-19 vaccines across the country, with a nearly 40% increase over February rates, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is tracking every dose. The first doses were given in mid-December in Utah.
Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson said 1,015,380 doses had been administered in Utah by Saturday.
“Hope is on the horizon!” she said.
The Utah Department of Health reported on Saturday that 1.16 million doses of vaccine have been delivered to Utah. More than half of those have gone to Salt Lake County, Utah’s most populous county. Doses are ordered and received based on population numbers.
At least 993,168 doses have been administered in the state, according to the health department, which said on Saturday that the governor’s office gets real time information, whereas the health department released updates daily. The report includes 25,687 doses administered since Friday’s report.
Two of the three available vaccine formulations, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, require at least two doses to achieve full efficacy. The health department reports 358,195 people have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 using those, and a total of 658,970 people in Utah have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine.
The health department reported 491 new cases of COVID-19 on Saturday, which brings the total number of known infections in the last year to 377,983. The number of new cases has been gradually declining since earlier this year, following a massive surge of cases during the holidays.
Nearly 2.3 million people in Utah have been tested for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the state has processed more than 4 million tests, according to the health department.
There are 144 people currently hospitalized with COVID-19 throughout Utah, down from 194 reportedly being treated at hospitals last Saturday.
The health department reported four new deaths on Saturday, including a Davis County man between the ages of 65 and 84 who was a long-term care facility resident; a Washington County woman between 65 and 84 who was hospitalized; a Davis County man between 65 and 84 who was hospitalized; and, a man between 45 and 64 who was not hospitalized and whose residence is unknown.

What will you do differently now?,Deseret News,2020-12-31T19:27:59Z,"How has 2020 changed you? Has it changed your perspective on life? Have you found that life and family are more precious? Are you unchanged?
As we embark upon a new year, this moment begs for a brief rear-view reflection. Look at who you used to be. Look at who you were in 2020. You overcame some hurdles. You prevailed over obstacles. You made it through some rough patches. You’ve got a few scars and bruises. You also have new insight about yourself. You are stronger, more resourceful and resilient than you thought you were.
We lived through it, 2020. We made it. Now that we are on the other side, what are we going to do differently? Let’s agree that the following aren’t options: ignoring issues, sticking our head in the sand, kicking the can down the road and deferring to the government.
We have experienced a social juggernaut which devoured decency, victimized the vulnerable and mercilessly manipulated morality. As we collect and cling to the vestiges of what is good, right and just, 2021 is beckoning us to be more socially and culturally conscious to respond to the past and future social tremors, traumas and tragedies. There is a whole world of new needs and obvious opportunities.
We experienced things in 2020 that should influence our purpose and perspective in 2021. We learned that hate is a virus and knowledge is a vaccine. Food insufficiency is everywhere and sharing is abundant. Some of our neighbors are hurting and love is a remedy. Problems and tension abound and so does concern and care. Allow a docent’s virtual guide through 2021 needs and opportunities, starting with a few questions and recommendations:
- How will people in underserved poor rural countries in Africa get the vaccine? Further, they don’t have refrigeration systems to store the COVID-19 vaccine. We can’t be vaccinated, while they die? Right? This an opportunity for advocacy, giving or a mission trip.
- Some families could afford tutors and private teachers while their children were in online school from home. What about the African American and LatinX children who have fallen behind in their studies, because they did not have a laptop, internet or tutor? This is an opportunity to develop and launch mentoring programs to help students catch up.
- What can we do for the children who were bullied in virtual school because of the way their home looked? How do we as adults, leaders, Christians, parents and humanitarians change this dynamic?
- What about the homes that did not have internet service for their child’s online studies before COVID and will have the subsidized service discontinued in 2021? This is an opportunity to pay it forward. This is an opportunity to make sure every child has access to online educational resources, when their school or library is not open or accessible.
- How do we help the former essential workers who were laid off and are now Uber, Lyft, DoorDash or EatStreet drivers? We can use these services more often and tip them very well — above 20%.
- How are we going to help Native Americans who live on reservations and desperately need water, hand sanitizer and food? This could be an opportunity for legislative advocacy, donating services to build infrastructure, giving and training.
- What are going to do to build or rebuild trust with law enforcement? This is an important issue, but defunding the police can’t be the only answer. Do we host town hall meetings with police superintendents? Do we ask for more transparency of officers’ records? Do we ask for different training, like de-escalation, for officers? Should we advocate for mandated body cams and the retention of video footage for 5–10 years? What can you do as a tax-paying citizen to make this situation better?
- What are we going to do about racism in this country? We may need a national czar to shape and show the priority of this issue, but this particular issue needs all of us — all in — all the way. More to come on this topic in February.
Let’s go into 2021 with our new found strength, resiliency and purpose. Let’s do it together.",2020-12-31T19:27:59Z,2020,4,7

Spencer Cox’s job approval ratings are already climbing,Deseret News,2021-02-21T04:58:04Z,"SALT LAKE CITY — He’s not even two months into the job, but Utahns are already giving Gov. Spencer Cox higher job performance approval ratings than the month before.
A new Deseret News/Hinckley Institute of Politics poll shows a healthy majority — 63% — of Utahns approve of Cox’s job performance so far, with 24% saying they strongly approve and 39% saying they somewhat approve. That’s while only 22% say they disapprove, with 15% saying they somewhat disapprove and only 7% strongly disapprove.
For about 15% of Utahns, they’re still unsure how they feel about the new governor.
The new poll shows Cox in just a matter of weeks increased his job approval ratings, up from 55% who said they approved in a Deseret News/Hinckley Institute of Politics poll from mid-January.
The new poll released Friday, conducted by pollster Scott Rasmussen, was of 1,000 Utah registered voters from Feb. 10-16, less than two months after Cox took office in January. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.
That January poll was “promising” for Cox, said Jason Perry, director of the University of Utah’s Hinckley Institute, but the new poll results released Friday bode even better for the new governor.
“It’s a good sign for Gov. Cox,” Perry said. “He has to be pleased with these numbers.”
Cox, when asked about how he himself feels about his job performance as governor so far in a virtual media availability on Friday, was sheepish in his answer.
“I don’t know, we just put our head down and go to work,” he said, smiling. “I think we’re doing OK. ... I feel good.”
Cox pointed to the state’s vaccination rollout, noting that while there have been “some bumps along the way,” he said he’s “really proud of everyone that stepped up ... to get us from the bottom of the country to the top of the country.”
“I’m really excited about the direction our (COVID-19 case) numbers are headed,” Cox added, pointing to the state’s declining coronavirus positivity rate. “I think in judging what we’re doing it has to be around the pandemic.”
Cox said his time these days is split 50% between the pandemic and the Utah Legislature’s 2021 session. “That puts a lot on the plate of the rest of my team,” Cox said, thanking them for their hard work.
Ultimately, Cox said, “I’ll leave it up to Utahns to judge how we’re doing,” he said. “We’re giving it everything we’ve got.”
Asked specifically about the poll numbers Friday, Cox spokeswoman Jennifer Napier-Pearce told the Deseret News the ratings are encouraging.
“We’re working hard to get as many Utahns vaccinated as soon as possible, so we’re heartened the majority of Utahns recognize the governor’s efforts,” she said.
The poll shows Cox’s ratings are all “trending in the right direction,” Perry said, noting that the new governor appears to have won hearts from a fair share of those Utahns who were undecided about him a month ago.
Cox’s management of the pandemic is likely “at the heart” of Cox’s high approval ratings so far, Perry said.
“Right now at the top of everyone’s mind is how can we take care of the vaccinations in the state of Utah,” Perry said. “And the reality is the majority of Utahns feel like Gov. Cox is doing a very good job.”
The poll shows Utahns’ ratings of Cox break out more modestly when they were asked specifically about his job performance handling the COVID-19 pandemic. About 53% gave him more favorable ratings, including 20% saying his handling has been “excellent” and 33% labeling his management “good.” About 23% rated Cox’s performance “fair,” while only 12% rated it as “poor.” About 13% said they aren’t sure.
Those slightly lower ratings aren’t surprising, Perry said, when considering how politically tricky emergencies can be for governors to navigate. But he noted that Cox’s numbers are “still high in comparison to other states where governors across the country are facing huge backlash” on their handling of the pandemic, including vaccine rollout plans.
“The reality is, most people in the state of Utah feel like Gov. Cox is leading us in the right direction,” Perry said.
What’s also noteworthy, Perry said, is Cox appears to be maintaining favorability from across party lines.
His approval ratings are fairly similar from both Democrats and Republicans, with 40% of Republicans and even a slightly higher 41% of Democrats saying they “somewhat approve” of Cox’s job performance, according to the poll.
About 29% of Republicans say they “strongly approve” of Cox’s performance, while 18% of Democrats say they “strongly approve.” Disapproval ratings are also similar by party affiliation, with 11% of Republicans and 18% of Democrats saying they “somewhat disapprove,” while only 8% of Republicans and 6% of Democrats say they “strongly disapprove.”
About 13% of Republicans and 17% of Democrats say they’re undecided.
“Gov. Cox seems to be finding that right balance,” Perry said, noting that that’s likely related to the reality that the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting everyone, regardless of party. “And so Republicans and Democrats both feel like Cox is doing a good job handling the COVID-19 pandemic.”
Like January’s poll, Friday’s survey results show Cox’s critics remain in the minority — including those from within his own party. That’s even though anti-mask mandate protesters last year showed up outside of Cox’s Fairview house and lined the street to Cox’s inauguration ceremony near St. George. The poll continues to show those Utahns are a part of a vocal minority.",2021-02-21T04:58:04Z,2021,1,8

- The new bill — which Democrats hope to pass sometime this week — includes stimulus checks and methods for providing more money for COVID-19 vaccine distribution.
- “The plan would offer direct payments to households, extended federal unemployment benefits, aid to state and local governments, and other steps,” according to Reuters.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said she plans to have the House vote on the bill by the end of the week, Reuters reports.
Will it pass?
There’s one point of controversy in the bill — it includes a proposal that would raise the minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 an hour by 2025, according to Reuters.
- Republicans oppose the idea. Senate Democrats mostly approve of the measure, but there has been some dispute.
- CNN reported last week that Democrats would need all of its members to approve the bill for it to pass. So far, Sens. Kyrsten Sinema, of Arizona, and Joe Manchin, of West Virginia have opposed elements of the plan, according to Fox News.

Here’s where we know it exists,Deseret News,2021-01-28T20:48:44Z,"The novel coronavirus variant that originated in South Africa has found its way to the United States, officials in South Carolina said Thursday morning, according to The Associated Press.
What happened?
South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control said the two cases don’t look to be connected, according to the AP.
Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, an infectious diseases physician at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, told The Associated Press that there could be undetected cases in the community since the cases aren’t linked.
- “That’s frightening,” said Kuppalli. “It’s probably more widespread.”
Details on the South African variant
According to The Washington Post, the South Africa variant led to “an enormous spike of new cases and deaths” because it is more transmissible.
The new variant has “not yet proved to be more lethal than others, including similarly highly transmissible variants recently detected in Britain and Brazil, but mutations that make it around 50% easier to catch have allowed it to stage a takeover of what was already out-of-control community transmission in South Africa,” The Washington Post reports.
Response
President Joe Biden ordered COVID-19 travel restrictions on most non-U.S. travelers from Brazil, Ireland, the United Kingdom and South Africa, The Associated Press reports.
- “This isn’t the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, according to The Associated Press.
Pfizer said its COVID-19 vaccine works against the South Africa mutation, which I wrote about for the Deseret News.
The COVID-19 vaccine developed by Moderna can protect people against the COVID-19 variants discovered in Britain and South Africa, too, according to my report for the Deseret News.
Moderna said it will create an upgrade to the COVID-19 vaccine that will help protect against the variants, too, according to The New York Times.
- “We’re doing it today to be ahead of the curve should we need to,” Dr. Tal Zaks, Moderna’s chief medical officer, told The New York Times. “I think of it as an insurance policy.”
- He added, “I don’t know if we need it, and I hope we don’t.”
What does Dr. Fauci say?
White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said earlier this week that the COVID-19 vaccine can be adapted to end mutations, according to CNBC.
- He said “booster” shots can be made to target the South Africa variant, for example.
- “We’re already trying to stay one or two steps ahead of the game so that if, in fact, we have a situation where the South African strain is prevalent here — it’s here, but it’s certainly not dominant — you want to really get ahead of it from a protection standpoint,” Fauci said, according to CNBC. “You’re going to want to have a vaccine that specifically addresses that strain.”
Bigger picture
Dr. Brannon Traxler, DHEC Interim Public Health Director, told The Associated Press that the new vaccine shows “the fight against this deadly virus is far from over.”
- “While more COVID-19 vaccines are on the way, supplies are still limited. Every one of us must recommit to the fight by recognizing that we are all on the front lines now. We are all in this together.”",2021-01-28T20:48:44Z,2021,1,8

Is there a COVID-19 vaccine pill?
Pfizer announced Tuesday it has already started the first phase of trials for the drug PF-07321332 — say that 10 times fast — in the United States.
- Per The Hill, the drug “is a potent protease inhibitor, the same kind of technology used to treat HIV and hepatitis C. Protease inhibitors bind to a viral enzyme and prevent the virus from replicating in the cell.”
Pfizer said some preclinical studies showed the pill could protect against the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and future viruses, too.
- “Tackling the COVID-19 pandemic requires both prevention via vaccine and targeted treatment for those who contract the virus. Given the way that SARS-CoV-2 is mutating and the continued global impact of COVID-19, it appears likely that it will be critical to have access to therapeutic options both now and beyond the pandemic,” Mikeal Dolsten, Pfizer chief scientific officer, said in a statement.
Is anyone else making a COVID vaccine pill?
Pfizer’s decision comes days after Oravax announced it is working on a COVID-19 vaccine pill, as I wrote for the Deseret News.
According to Business Insider, the Oravax pill will enter the first phase of its clinical trials later in 2021. That would be the first step in determining whether or not the pill can work as a vaccine. Right now, the vaccine is given through an injection in the arm.
- “There is no guarantee of success, and even if it works it could be a year or more before it is authorized for use,” according to Insider.
Will a vaccine pill work?
Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said in an email to Business Insider that there’s no guarantee a vaccine pill would work.
- “We would need properly conducted studies to prove (oral vaccines’) worth,” he said. “But they may also be of value in people who are severely needle phobic and may be easier and more rapid to administer.”",2021-03-29T00:00:00Z,2021,1,8

What’s going on?
Jennifer Nuzzo of Johns Hopkins and Michael Mina of Harvard’s Kennedy School of Public Health spoke at an Axios virtual event about coronavirus.
The experts agreed more rapid testing needs to be done before the pandemic can end.
- “Testing informs our understanding of what’s going on at all levels, from the personal — knowing that today is not the day to go and visit my vulnerable relatives because I’m infected — to the national, trying to understand, is the situation in the U.S. getting better? Is it worse?” Nuzzo said.
- “We need rapid tests that are ubiquitous, that we can use in lots of different places, and at a volume that will enable repeat testing. And we also need them to be much more inexpensive than they are right now,” Nuzzo said.
The experts agreed that tests could be used to monitor the community levels of the virus, rather than as a diagnostic exam.
- “(I)n the midst of a pandemic, we can switch the purpose of testing from just purely a diagnostic test to actually a test that is going to help mitigate spread at the community level. ... The only way to make that a reality is to get the tests away from being prescription-use only, make them smaller, simpler and tests that people could be using at home,” Mina said.
Bigger picture:
Dr. Anthony Fauci said Wednesday that he isn’t ready to declare the pandemic over yet either, The Associated Press reports.
- “We are at the corner. Whether we or not we are going to be turning the corner remains to be seen.”
Fauci’s concerns come as experts worry about a potential new surge of cases due to COVID-19 variants and loosening of restrictions, which I wrote about for the Deseret News.

Dr. Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told CNN on Tuesday night that the COVID-19 vaccine will continue to be effective against the coronavirus if people keep cases low.
- “The best thing we could possibly do to improve the chances that the vaccine will continue working as we’re hoping it will, is to reduce cases as much as possible without having those reductions occur as a result of vaccine-derived immunity,” he said.
Mina said that wearing masks and staying socially distanced can keep the coronavirus from spreading at a high level. Soon, it will become likely that you’re interacting with someone who is already vaccinated.
- “The more opportunities we give the virus to come in contact with somebody who is immune, the more opportunities there are for the virus to find a way around that level of immunity and those antibodies,” Mina said, per CNN.

They can’t figure out how many sites to roll out, they can’t figure out how many vaccinators that they need, and they can’t figure out how many appointments to make for the public,” Walensky told “Fox News Sunday.”
Walensky said the lack of knowledge is due to “the challenges we’ve been left with” — which appeared to be a shot at the Trump administration, according to CNBC.
- Walensky said vaccine distribution will increase by March, though.
Out of context?
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on NBC’s “Today” show that Walensky’s comments may have been taken out of context.
- “What she was trying to say is that there are multiple steps, producing the vaccine, getting it into the viles, getting it shipped, getting it distributed, and getting it into people’s arms. There are vaccines at each one of those steps.”
- He added, “But Dr. Walensky was right, there is confusion at any given stage, but we can get our arms around that and get the information quickly.”
February will be grim
Walensky predicted on “Face the Nation” in mid-January that the U.S. will see 500,000 total deaths from COVID-19 in February, as I wrote about for the Deseret News.
“That doesn’t speak to the tens of thousands of people who are living with a yet uncharacterized syndrome after they’ve been recovered, after they’ve recovered,” she said. “And we still yet haven’t seen the ramifications of what happened from the holiday travel, from holiday gathering in terms of high rates of hospitalizations and the deaths thereafter. So, yes, I think we still have some dark weeks ahead.”",2021-01-25T20:00:00Z,2021,1,8

What happened:
Gottlieb told CBS’ “Face the Nation” over the weekend that the United States’ plan needs to be rebooted in order to be effective.
- “We need to acknowledge that it’s not working,” Gottlieb said. “We need to hit the reset and adopt a new strategy in trying to get that out to patients.”
He added that getting the vaccine out quickly is the only hope to stopping COVID-19.
- “We really need to get this vaccine out more quickly, because this is really our only tool,” he said.
What’s the problem?
Across the country, states have started to distribute the COVID-19 vaccine. But distribution isn’t meeting projected numbers given by the Trump administration. There have been reports of COVID-19 vaccines just sitting in shelves — which is one reason why Utah Gov. Spencer Cox decided to speed up the process for vaccinations with an executive order.
Gottlieb said distribution is the main issue with the current vaccination plan. There is plenty of supply — but there’s no way to distribute the vaccine in mass quantities out to the people.
- “A lot of senior citizens aren’t going to want to go to a, you know, a stadium to get an inoculation. They’re going to want to go to a pharmacy, a local pharmacy or a doctor’s office. So, we need to provide more opportunity for people to get a vaccination where they’re comfortable getting it. But we do need to get these out more aggressively. Right now, you’re right, it’s a distribution issue. It will become a supply issue once we get the logistics down, right. And we don’t have that right now. We aren’t doing a good job getting this to patients.”
A solution?
Gottlieb said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” last weekend that CVS, Walgreens and other locations should start giving out vaccines, as I wrote about for the Deseret News.
- “Make the vaccine more generally available through the retail pharmacies, through Walmart and Walgreens and CVS to a broader population, to a general population starting with age,” Gottlieb said in an interview on “Face the Nation.” “We can walk it down the age continuum, make it available for 75 and above first, then 70 and above and 65 and above. There’s 50 million Americans 65 and above, a large percentage of them probably want to be vaccinated. At some point, we need to allow supply to meet demand here and get the shots into the arms of the people who really want to get vaccinated and are going to go out and seek out the vaccination.”",2021-01-12T12:30:00Z,2021,1,8

- Per Business Insider, the pill form of the vaccine could enter the first phases of a clinical trial this year, which is the first step in developing such a vaccine. There are currently no pill versions of the COVID-19 vaccine.
What’s going on?
Oravax said in a statement it hopes to start clinical trials on the coronavirus vaccine pill by June.
- “There is no guarantee of success, and even if it works it could be a year or more before it is authorized for use,” according to Insider.
- The pill would be a “second generation” vaccine, which are often used for widespread distribution, according to Insider. A vaccine in pill form would be easier to administer as well.
Will it work?
Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said in an email to Business Insider that there needs to be caution with this idea.
- “We would need properly conducted studies to prove (oral vaccines’) worth,” he said. “But they may also be of value in people who are severely needle phobic and may be easier and more rapid to administer.”
- Hunter said a pill could do better than injections to stop future infections.
For now, you’ll have to get the COVID-19 vaccine through an injection.

Carano — who previously played Cara Dune in “Star Wars” — told Deadline:
- “The Daily Wire is helping make one of my dreams — to develop and produce my own film — come true. I cried out and my prayer was answered. I am sending out a direct message of hope to everyone living in fear of cancellation by the totalitarian mob. I have only just begun using my voice which is now freer than ever before, and I hope it inspires others to do the same. They can’t cancel us if we don’t let them.”

- “We could not be more excited to be working with Gina Carano, an incredible talent dumped by Disney and Lucasfilm for offending the authoritarian Hollywood Left. This is what Daily Wire exists to do: provide an alternative not just for consumers, but for creators who refuse to bow to the mob,” said Daily Wire co-founder Shapiro.
- “We’re eager to bring Gina’s talent to Americans who love her, and we’re just as eager to show Hollywood that if they want to keep canceling those who think differently, they’ll just be helping us build the Xwing to take down their Death Star,” he added.

https://www.deseret.com/utah/2021/3/17/22336094/harmons-will-keep-mask-requirement-after-statewide-mandate-lifted-for-now/,Harmons will keep mask requirement after statewide mandate lifted — for now,Deseret News,2021-03-17T19:40:06Z,"SALT LAKE CITY — A Utah grocery store chain will continue to require masks be worn to protect customers and employees against COVID-19, even after the April 10 scheduled lifting of the statewide mask mandate.
In an email sent Tuesday to customers titled, “Wearing Is Caring,” and featuring a drawing of a face mask, Harmons top executives, Bob Harmon and Mark Jensen said, “For now, Harmons will maintain its current COVID-19 safety practices, including the wearing of masks.”
Jensen, Harmons CEO and president, told the Deseret News Wednesday nearly all of the reaction to the decision has been positive so far, including from employees who’ll have to turn away customers refusing to comply with what will be store policy once the state government mandate ends.
“It only makes sense for us to continue to see this through to the end. We really believe our customers want us to do that, too,” Jensen said, adding that Harmons anticipates more business as a result of continuing to take precautions against the spread of the virus.
Out of the more than 250,000 customers Harmons serves daily, he said several hundred typically take the time to thank the store for its efforts and only a few complain about wearing a mask. “We don’t think that will change after April 10,” Jensen said.
The email said the company started in 1932 is “very proud of how far we’ve come in our efforts to keep everyone safe and we intend to continue on that pathway,” pointing out that a majority of employees have not yet had an opportunity to be vaccinated against the virus.
The Utah Legislature passed a bill expected to be signed by Gov. Spencer Cox ending the mask mandate on April 10 and relaxing other restrictions put into place to stop the spread of the virus as soon as the state has received 1.63 million vaccine doses, as long as case counts and hospitalization rates stay low.
Currently, vaccinations are available only for Utahns 50 and older as well as those with specified medical conditions, health care workers, first responders, long-term care facility residents and staffs, and K-12 teachers and school staffs.
The state’s vaccine eligibility list is expected to expand to all Utahns on April 1. Unlike some other states, Utah has not prioritized grocery store employees, who tend to be younger, as essential workers who need to be vaccinated quickly.
The Harmons executives cited the upcoming changes and said they wanted “to reiterate our approach to keeping our associates and customers safe,” but stopped short of criticizing lawmakers. They said Harmons has “closely followed guidance from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention” throughout the pandemic.
“Like you, we are excited to see the light at the end of the tunnel as vaccinations roll out and cases continue to drop, but we aren’t quite at the finish line yet,” they said, adding they “look forward to removing masks and barriers at an appropriate time. We still have a ways to go, but together we can get there.”
Harmons helped an effort that led last year to lawmakers repealing a massive tax reform package that included an increase in the sales tax on food, by allowing their stores to be used to collect signatures for a citizens referendum to put the issue on the ballot.
Other supermarket and large retail chains around the country, including Kroger, the parent companies of Smith’s, Albertsons and Target, have said they will continue to require masks be worn, even as Texas, Alabama, Mississippi and other states are removing mandates, CBS News has reported.
A Kroger spokesperson said in a statement that the company “will continue to require everyone in our stores across the country to wear masks until all our front-line grocery associates can receive the COVID-19 vaccine” as well as continue to encourage social distancing, frequent hand washing and using grocery delivery or pick-up services.
“The Kroger Family of Companies’ most urgent priority throughout the COVID-19 pandemic has been to provide a safe environment for our associates and customers while meeting our societal obligation to provide open stores, e-commerce solutions and an efficiently operating supply chain so that our communities have access to fresh food,” the statement said.
Utah’s latest COVID-19 numbers
Wednesday, the Utah Department of Health reported 699 new COVID-19 cases and five additional deaths.
The number of vaccine doses administered in the state has hit 1,054,727, a daily increase of 27,654 shots.
The rolling seven-day average for positive tests is now 499 per day, with another 8,666 Utahns taking 19,892 tests since Tuesday. The rolling seven-day average for percent positivity of tests is 4.1% when all results are included and 8.3% when multiple test results from an individual over 90 days are excluded.
Utah has 180 people hospitalized with COVID-19, bringing the total number of hospitalizations in the state since the pandemic began just over a year ago to 15,198.
Utah’s death toll is now at 2,037 with the five deaths reported Tuesday, including four that occurred before Feb. 17. They are:
- A San Juan County man, between 45 and 64, long-term care facility resident.
- A Salt Lake County woman, older than 85, long-term care facility resident.

https://www.deseret.com/2021/1/29/22256100/covid-19-vaccine-travel-dr-anthony-fauci/,Can you travel after you get the COVID-19 vaccine? Here’s what Dr. Fauci says,Deseret News,2021-01-29T23:07:49Z,"Getting the COVID-19 vaccine doesn’t necessarily mean you have a free pass to travel as much as you want, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci.
What’s happening?
A number of infectious disease experts gathered together for a virtual CNN global town hall hosted by Anderson Cooper and Dr. Sanjay Gupta earlier this week.
What’s going on?
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, spoke at the event. He was asked about whether or not people can travel once they get the COVID-19 vaccine. Here’s what he said:
- “Getting vaccinated does not say you have a free pass to travel,” Fauci said. “Nor does it say you have a free pass to put aside all the public health measures that we talk about all the time.”
- “You can get some degree of protection that isn’t durable 10 days to 14 days after the first dose, but you can’t rely on that,” said Fauci. “The maximum immunity begins about 10 days to two weeks and beyond following the second dose. That goes for anyone, regardless of whether you want to travel or not.”
Fauci said even after the second dose, you may not have his full permission to travel, according to Forbes.
- “That would give you as a group about a 94% to 95% efficacy and a good safety profile,” he said. “It is not a good idea to travel, period. We don’t want people to think that because they got vaccinated that other public health recommendations just don’t apply.”
Research says something similar
A study recently published in JMIR Public Health and Surveillance found wearing face masks “could lead to more COVID-19 spread” without the right messaging, as I wrote about for the Deseret News.
The study said people who wore masks still had contact with other people, including adults and seniors, which led to more coronavirus case numbers among those who wore masks. Essentially, people saw their masks as a free pass.
- “When you wear a mask, you may have a deceptive sense of being protected and have more interactions with other people,” said Eline van den Broek-Altenburg, an assistant professor and vice chair for Population Health Science in the Department of Radiology at the Larner College of Medicine, said in a statement.
Local reaction
University of Utah Health Division of Infectious Diseases associate professor Dr. Emily Spivak told the Deseret News in January that the first dose isn’t a free pass, either.
- “The whole point of the second dose is to boost the sort of the amount of antibody and the amount of immunity that you have and hopefully the length. We just don’t even know how long the protection is after two doses,” Spivak said.",2021-01-29T23:07:49Z,2021,1,8
https://www.deseret.com/utah/2021/2/2/22260459/company-behind-test-utah-gets-state-vaccination-contract-nomi-health/,"Utah contracts for vaccine distribution help, signs company behind ‘Test Utah’",Deseret News,2021-02-02T16:23:05Z,"SALT LAKE CITY — Utah has signed a contract for COVID-19 vaccination distribution with Nomi Health, an Orem-based health care company behind taxpayer-funded coronavirus testing that state auditors found initially had a much higher price tag than expected.
“They had some bumps, for sure, and some hard knocks that they’d been through because of trying to do it so fast and be so responsive. So I think everyone acknowledges that there were some hiccups along the way,” Utah Department of Health Interim Executive Director Rich Saunders said.
But Saunders said he’s “had a lot of interaction” over the months with the company that continues to be behind the state’s “Test Utah” program under a new contract, and is confident in Nomi’s ability to “be agile and responsive to what we need them to do” —especially vaccinating large numbers of Utahns quickly and safely.
Josh Walker, Nomi’s co-founder and chief operating officer, said, “We are very dedicated to being good stewards of public dollars and public programs. We are Utahns ourselves and we’re very interested in making sure that we are being very effective there. We are also applying all the learnings we have had.”
The contract awarded Jan. 26 allows the state, Utah’s 13 local health departments and other public entities to use Nomi Health to set up and run vaccination sites for a monthly price of $90,000 or $125,000, depending on capacity, plus an average of $22.67 for administering each shot. A vaccination van is available for $75,000 a month.
When that happens has yet to be determined, Saunders said, adding it could be as early as this week “or it could be as late as we never use them.” He said the contract is intended to help augment local health department vaccination programs as the state’s weekly allotment of doses increases.
Walker, however, said the company is already in “late-stage” conversations with two Utah health agencies he declined to name about providing services. One is looking for “immediate support,” he said, and the other, for help once the state’s vaccine supply increases.
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox announced last week that allotments may triple to around 100,000 doses a week in March and April, thanks to the Biden administration’s purchase of 200 million additional doses of the currently approved Pfizer and Moderna vaccines as well as the anticipated authorization of new vaccines for distribution.
Already, Utah is set to receive about 7,000 additional first doses a week over the next six weeks or so, up from around 33,000, the governor said on KSL Newsradio’s “Live Mic” Monday. Once the new Johnson & Johnson vaccine is approved, that should climb beyond 70,000, he said.
When a fourth vaccine is added to the list, likely hitting 100,000 doses a week, Cox said help will be needed.
“That’s what we’re working on now. In fact, last week we started this conversation of now that we know that we have, the potential for that kind of increase, who are the partners that we need to bring on? We can’t do that with local health districts on their own. They’re close to maxing out,” the governor said.
As the state’s current distribution capacity is reached, that’s when Utahns will see “local pharmacists, the grocery stores, clinics, all of those. And then mass vaccination sites, the stadiums and others, so we can just move as many people through as quickly as possible,” Cox said, without mentioning the Nomi contract.
Saunders said, “In the end we may just use the existing infrastructure,” which includes West Valley City-based Community Nursing Services, already vaccinating some teachers and school staffs, and pharmacies including CVS and Walgreens, administering doses in long-term care facilities.
Assistance in providing at least 1,000 shots a day at mass vaccination sites — Vivint Smart Home Arena has been mentioned as a potential location — could come from Intermountain Healthcare or University of Utah Health, state health department spokesman Tom Hudachko said.
Shots became available in Utah in mid-December for front-line hospital health care workers and eligibility has since expanded to all health care workers, emergency services personnel, first responders, long-term care facility residents and staff, teachers and school staff and, most recently, all Utahns 70 or older.
Once older Utahns were added to the list, local health districts have had difficulty keeping up with the demand. In Salt Lake County, servers and phone banks crashed at the start of the sign-ups earlier this month, and all available appointments were almost immediately booked through the coming weeks.
Saunders said the health department is also working with another, existing state contractor to create a new online platform that will make it easier for Utahns to make vaccination appointments that would be operated by the state but available to local health departments.
Nomi is offering specialized technology, including software and server capacity, Walker said, that can handle making online appointments during demand peaks that he compared to a post-Thanksgiving “Black Friday,” along with a call center staffed by nearly 1,000 nurses for those who need additional help or don’t use computers.
The company’s contract with the state is for five years. Walker said whether Utah will need Nomi’s vaccination services that long is “anybody’s guess. We hope not ... although COVID will now be part of our lives sort of forever.”
The state’s initial multmillion-dollar contract with Nomi for the private testing initiative known as Test Utah that continues today was part of an audit of the $108 million spent by the state in response to the pandemic released in September by Utah Auditor John Dougall.
The audit concluded that while the company’s per-test costs were “reasonable,” the “actual per-test costs were unreasonable.” The state’s original 60-day, $7.6 million contract with Nomi, anticipated up to 3,000 COVID-19 tests a day, which would have cost about $44 each.
But because “the actual tests processed per day was substantially lower than projected, resulting in a cost per test of over $235,” the audit said, pointing out the price turned out to be “significantly higher than other established testing services, which list their price at $125 or less per test.”
Dougall said Monday he has not reviewed Nomi’s current contract for coronavirus testing or the company’s new contract for vaccinations. Neither are slated for review, he said, because his office is focused on a new audit for the federal government of the coronavirus relief funds sent to the state.
He said the issue with the original Test Utah contract was that the state overestimated how many Utahns would get tested at a time of “uncertainty” about the process. With vaccines, Dougall said, there is more demand than doses, so if there are people hired to administer vaccines “sitting around idle,” that could be cause for concern.
“It really comes to, how much are we paying and for what are we paying. That could be good, appropriate, reasonable. I just don’t know the details of the latest contract,” the auditor said. “At the end of the day it really depends on, here’s the performance.”
Chris Hughes, state purchasing division director, said only one other company, Florida-based Red Tag-19, participated in the bidding process but was excluded based on responses during the technical evaluation before reaching the cost phase.
Hughes said Nomi was “flagged” over the publicity from last year’s audit, but no one suggested rejecting the bid.
Dr. Lata Shintre, the head of Red Tag-19, a COVID-19 staffing and management company, said she didn’t know enough about Nomi to comment on the state’s choice. But she said states should be hiring medical professionals to oversee vaccinations, because “we are not going to be the cheapest bid but we are going to be the safest.”
Nomi and other Utah tech companies initially volunteered to help the state deal with the virus outbreak, a stance that shifted as the scope and the scale of the crisis escalated. Asked Monday if Nomi would make money from vaccine distribution, Walker said, “Yes, we are a for-profit organization.”",2021-02-02T16:23:05Z,2021,1,8

What’s going on?
Italian researchers recently discovered in new data that health care workers with obesity produced about half the antibodies from a second jab compared to healthy people, The Guardian reports.
- “Although it is too soon to know what this means for the efficacy of the vaccine, it might imply that people with obesity need an additional booster dose to ensure they are adequately protected against coronavirus,” according to The Guardian.
Obesity has led to increasing risk of death from COVID-19 — which is one reason why it’s one of the medical issues that allows you to get the vaccine in Utah.
Per The Guardian, obesity’s risk with COVID-19 might be one reason why the vaccine could be ineffective.
- “Some of this may be because people with obesity often have other underlying medical conditions, such as heart disease or type 2 diabetes, that increase their risk from the coronavirus, but excess body fat can also cause metabolic changes, such as insulin resistance and inflammation, which make it harder for the body to fight off infections.”
Still, get the vaccine
Experts still encourage those with obesity to get the COVID-19 vaccine if they qualify in their state. Dr. Fatima Stanford, an obesity medicine physician, told NPR that obesity is “a good measure” to assess potential risk factors.
- Those with obesity who don’t get vaccinated are at an increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19.
- “We’re talking about two inflammatory conditions. We have chronic inflammation associated with obesity, the disease, not playing well with the acute inflammatory process of COVID-19,” said Stanford, who works at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital.",2021-03-02T15:00:00Z,2021,1,8

What’s going on?
Garcetti recently spoke on CBS program “Face the Nation” about COVID-19’s spread through California, which has seen record case numbers and hospitalizations this fall.
Garcetti said the recent vaccine rollout “has made everybody so hopeful” that they relax on their behaviors, which has caused an increase in cases.
- “We cannot. We cannot let up,” the mayor said. “This is a virus that preys off of our weakness, preys off of our exhaustion.”
Garcetti said cases are spreading so fast that there’s a new case every six seconds, and it’s likely due to household spread, according to The New York Times.
- “This is something now that really is spreading in the home,” Mr. Garcetti said, adding: “It’s a message for all of America: We might not all have the same density as L.A., but what’s happening in L.A. can and will be coming in many communities in America.”

https://www.deseret.com/indepth/2021/1/14/22214491/religious-leaders-object-to-unequal-distribution-of-covid-19-vaccine-inequality-israel-palestine/,Religious leaders speak out on unequal vaccine distribution,Deseret News,2021-01-15T05:00:00Z,"As the head chaplain at Los Angeles County + University of Southern California Medical Center — a public hospital in downtown Los Angeles — Father Chris Ponnet spends his days at the epicenter of the pandemic, tending to the spiritual needs of those who are sick with or dying from COVID-19.
The facility is overflowing, he says, adding that, “We have hospital beds now in what used to be a waiting room and all of our ICUs are almost exclusively COVID patients.”
As a frontline worker, Father Ponnet received the COVID-19 vaccine at the end of December, which makes him feel privileged, as well as conflicted.
On the one hand, he understands that he’s at higher risk of catching the virus than others; on the other, he knows that many other Americans who are vulnerable to infection are slipping through the cracks.
“The (vaccine) distribution has to include people who are not considered front-line people,” he says. “So many of our patients live in that reality.”
He points out that the pandemic has disproportionately impacted minorities and Americans from lower socioeconomic backgrounds who lack access to health care and often live in crowded conditions that facilitate the spread of the virus. Vaccine distribution needs to take those conditions into account, he says.
“How do we get this out to the most vulnerable?” he asks.
As the COVID-19 vaccine rolls out, Father Ponnet is far from the only religious leader raising questions about its distribution. Many have decried the decisions made so far, arguing that unequal access to the vaccine will only exacerbate existing racial and economic inequalities — both nationally and globally.
“The distribution of the vaccine is throwing a spotlight once again on racial inequality. ... We just need to open our eyes to see it and create models that will address it” both in the short term and long run, says Bishop Thomas Bickerton, who oversees hundreds of United Methodist churches in eastern New York and western Connecticut.
He and other religious leaders believe the vaccine rollout is a stark reminder of the need to address injustice in everything from health care to housing and an opportunity to begin to right systemic wrongs.
“We can see very clearly how inequitably resources are distributed — in this case, lifesaving resources,” says Rabbi Brant Rosen, who is the founder of the non-denominational Jewish synagogue Tzedek, which is Hebrew for justice. “If saving life isn’t sacrosanct then what right do we have to call ourselves people of faith?”
First in line
While CDC recommendations have specified that front-line workers, many of whom are minorities, should be prioritized in the vaccination process, some religious leaders believe this doesn’t go far enough.
Because Black and brown communities have been disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus, they should get the vaccine first — regardless of their occupation or age or whether or not they have preexisting conditions, says the Rev. Myra Brown, a Black woman who leads Spiritus Christi, an Independent Catholic Church in Rochester, New York.
“If you’re a person of color, this virus has told us you are at risk,” she says. “If I was getting the vaccines in a particular area I’d vaccinate people of color regardless of what the guidelines say.”
At the very least, health officials should not let privileged people cut to the front of the line, says Bishop Bickerton, pointing to the politicians who have been vaccinated ahead of the population they serve.
He intends to follow in the footsteps of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has said he won’t get the vaccine until it’s available for Black, Hispanic, and economically underprivileged Americans in his age group.
“I continue to be very concerned about a distribution model that is not effective and especially for Black and brown communities who live in marginalized communities and don’t get quick access,” says Bishop Bickerton. “It’s time to relook at the distribution model.”
Bishop Bickerton is also troubled by the fact that doses of the vaccine have been shipped but not distributed.
“When you’ve got x amount of vaccines available and a very small number of those vaccines have been administered — we have a problem on our hands,” he says.
He points to Israel as an example of a country that is leading the world in administering the vaccine to its citizens. The United States, he says, can learn from the way the Israelis prepared ahead of time to get the vaccine out.
“The question is: what is the model that needs to be put in place that will increase our effectiveness?” he says.
But a leader of Chicago’s Jewish community sees Israel’s experience a bit differently.
“The term health apartheid has been used to describe what’s going on in Israel and Palestine (the occupied Palestinian territories),” says Rabbi Rosen. While Israel “is going to great pains to vaccinate citizens ... it is prioritizing them over the millions of Palestinians under their control.”
Just as minorities in America have struggled with the effects of the pandemic, so has the already-struggling Palestinian economy been pummeled in recent months. And, in the past few weeks, Israel has wrestled with a debate around its responsibilities to help vaccinate the Palestinian populations that live under its military rule.
Who is essential?
Reflecting on the similarities to minorities’ treatment in America, Rabbi Rosen says he is heartened by CDC recommendations that essential workers be prioritized in vaccination efforts. But he and other religious leaders also worry that the term “essential” means different things to different people.
“I think the definition of what is essential work and what is an essential worker is relatively subjective,” Rabbi Rosen says.
Reflecting on the recommendation that “essential workers” get the vaccine before other parts of the population, the Rev. Brown also raised concerns.
Such language, she says, replicates “the ways in which we are socialized to think about each other’s groups so that we maintain the inequalities that we have.”
In order to avoid that trap, people of faith “have to be thought leaders on this,” the Rev. Brown says. “We can’t let someone tell us who is essential and who is not essential, who is deserving and who is not deserving.”
Her remarks echo the sentiment expressed by Pope Francis in his Christmas Day speech. Likening the COVID-19 vaccine to a light of hope, Pope Francis said, “But for these lights to illuminate and bring hope to all, they need to be available to all.”
The “law of the marketplace and patents” should not “take precedence over the law of love and the health of humanity,” Pope Francis continued, as he called on “government leaders, businesses, international organizations to foster cooperation and not competition, and to seek a solution for everyone.”
If done well, the vaccine rollout could be the beginning of a more equitable approach to distributing all kinds of goods and services, religious leaders said.
“As we move towards a just recovery, we must ensure that immediate cures for the crises become stepping-stones to a more just society,” read a joint statement from the Vatican COVID-19 Commission and the Pontifical Academy for Life released last month.
Past pandemics helped inspire the creation of community-oriented institutions like hospitals, Father Ponnet says. The COVID-19 crisis is a similar opportunity to reexamine how we’re caring for the marginalized, in general.
“How do (we) encourage policies at a local level as well as a national and international level that address how we’re going to take care of the most vulnerable?” he says.",2021-01-15T05:00:00Z,2021,1,8

Hospital praises care he received,Deseret News,2021-03-06T19:28:18Z,"SALT LAKE CITY — The first COVID-19 patient treated at University of Utah Hospital said he wasn’t scared to die, but he was hoping to pull through after his lungs quit working.
Neal Murphy, 75, believes he contracted COVID-19 on a Feb. 27, 2020, flight from California to Salt Lake City to visit his son, who is a doctor at University Hospital. He said was “too tired” to go to dinner that night and by morning, his temperature had reached 104.5 degrees.
“I said to my wife, ‘This is not a cold.’ A day later, they said, this is COVID,” Murphy recalled in a U. video production created to commemorate the anniversary of Murphy’s survival of COVID-19.
“It was the worst possible scenario,” he said, adding that he was immediately isolated at the hospital. Murphy was given supplemental oxygen and was ultimately intubated and put on a ventilator for five days. At one point, he was given a 3% chance of survival.
“I’ve beat odds like that, that’s no problem,” he said. Murphy said he posted a picture of the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., on his hospital bed railing. “If he can survive five years of torture, I can go through this.”
Murphy’s son, Dr. Ryan Murphy, said that in his dad’s situation, “there’s nothing he could do ... either he was going to survive or he’s not.”
“He’s all about the fight, the struggle — never give up, never surrender. That’s his ethos,” the younger Murphy said.
In all, the elder Murphy, a professor of dentistry in Cleveland, was hospitalized in Utah for 13 days.
“I wasn’t scared. I’m 75 years old. I’ve been around the block a few times,” he said. “There’s a point where you have to say, ‘I can do no more.’”
Murphy said he felt “reassured” by the U. staff.
“Miracles are helped along by the dedicated people in health care, that cannot be denied,” he said. “They really are heroes. I would be a dead man without them.”
The Utah Department of Health reported 570 new COVID-19 cases on Saturday, as well as five new deaths.
The number of new cases has been gradually declining since after the first of the year. The rolling seven-day average of people with confirmed cases is now 9.5% with the average percentage of tests sitting at 4.6%.
The state administered nearly 26,100 doses of COVID-19 vaccine since Friday’s report, bringing the total number of people who have been fully vaccinated to 304,168 in Utah. A total of 843,032 doses of vaccine have been administered in the state, according to the health department.
Utah has tested 2.24 million people for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including 7,052 since Friday’s report was issued midday.
There are 194 people currently hospitalized with COVID-19, 29 fewer than was reported a week ago.
The deaths reported on Saturday include a Salt Lake County woman older than 85 who was not hospitalized at the time of her death; a Salt Lake County woman between the ages of 45 and 64 who was hospitalized; a Weber County man between 45 and 64 who was hospitalized; a Salt Lake County woman between 25 and 44 who was hospitalized; and, a Uintah County woman between 45 and 64 who was hospitalized.
The total number of lives lost to COVID-19 in Utah is at 1,975 since the pandemic hit here a year ago.",2021-03-06T19:28:18Z,2021,1,8

In a statement, Adams said K-12 educators will be eligible for COVID-19 vaccines starting Monday.
“The excuses need to end at once,” he said.
Adams’ statement notes that the Salt Lake District is the only school district statewide that has not implemented in-person learning options with precautions to protect educators, staff and students.
“It is time to step up,” the Layton Republican said.
The district’s instruction has largely been delivered remotely since the start of the school year, but teachers have met in schools with small groups of students who need services such as special education or English language instruction.
Under current plans, schools will offer an in-person learning option to elementary schools on a phased-in basis starting Jan. 25.
Late Tuesday, the Salt Lake City Board of Education voted to tie the return to the classroom for students in grades 7-12 to the availability of vaccines for teachers, but the board chose no specific date. The board also did not act on a request by interim Superintendent Larry Madden that all teachers work from schools starting on Jan. 25.
Adams noted that teachers have done an “amazing job” with the resources they have been given, “but students should have the opportunity to learn in the classroom. It has been reported that in Salt Lake City School District there is a 600% increase in students failing all classes, despite teachers’ best efforts. The increased failure rate among students is proof that remote learning, while a good option for some, is not a perfect solution for all.”
Adams said schools provide more than just academics.
“K-12 students learn social skills, receive meals, exercise and have access to other support services,” he said. “Vulnerable and low-income children are particularly affected by lack of contact with classmates. Additionally, it serves as a safe place for many children while parents are working.”
Earlier, legislative leaders announced that the Utah Legislature will provide a $1,500 bonus to all school teachers for their efforts during the pandemic. But the stipend was conditioned on teachers performing a combination of in-person and remote learning.
In a statement issued earlier this week, House Speaker Brad Wilson, R-Kaysville, also called on the district to resume an in-person instruction model so Salt Lake educators will qualify for the bonus.
“I hope the board members who are charged with caring for their students will choose to start in-classroom instruction by Feb. 8 so Salt Lake City teachers can receive their stipend and their students can get back to school,” his statement said in part.
According to two members of the Salt Lake School Board, educators said they prize their health above the bonus and prefer to return to school when it is safe to do so.
The district has been under mounting pressure to reopen schools, with Gov. Spencer Cox, legislative leaders and a group of Salt Lake parents who filed a civil rights lawsuit calling for a change in course. The parents’ lawsuit demands the option of in-person learning for their children.
Recent reports that some 4,000 middle schoolers and high schoolers received at least one F grade or incomplete grade during the first quarter of the 2020-21 school year have heightened concerns locally and at the state level.
School district spokeswoman Yándary Chatwin said the school district had no comment.
Most Wasatch Front school districts have offered learners in-person and remote instruction options in an array of configurations since the start of school this fall. According to the districts, transmission of COVID-19 has been low in elementary schools and highest in high schools, which officials attribute to students’ mobility and tendency to socialize more outside of school but not necessarily use precautions that help reduce spread of the virus such as masking and social distancing.
Cox announced Friday that the state’s K-12 educators will be eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccines starting Monday.
State Superintendent Sydnee Dickson said in a statement that she is pleased that educators had been prioritized for vaccination.
“By allowing teachers to be a priority for the COVID-19 vaccine, we are giving them the necessary extra layer of protection to feel safe inside of their classrooms. This step allows school communities to continue to excel in meeting student needs by allowing for quality in-person instruction. I am proud to see Utah succeeding and leading in the nation by highlighting the importance of getting teachers vaccinated early,” Dickson said.",2021-01-08T23:29:32Z,2021,1,8

There was the woman who came to the Davis County Health Department offices in Clearfield last summer who had been exposed to COVID-19 and needed to be tested.
“She was physically shaking. She was just so frightened, so fearful, so afraid she was going to die,” remembers Wendy, a registered nurse who is the Davis County division director for family health and disease control.
That’s a bureaucratic way of saying she’s the person in charge of pandemics.
When the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in Utah, it was Wendy who took the call from the Utah Department of Health confirming that the infected person resided in her jurisdiction.
“Congratulations, Davis County is the first county in Utah to have a COVID case,” she was informed.
It was 5:30 p.m. on March 6, 2020.
Quitting time. Supposedly. But no one went home that day until one the next morning.
It was just the beginning of 70-hour workweeks filled with testing, treating, contact tracing, quarantining, social distancing and, finally, vaccinating.
“It’s been a very difficult and tough year; I can say that with conviction,” says Wendy. “Just exhausting. Like being on the front lines at the battle field.”
That first case, of course, morphed into dozens, then hundreds, then thousands, placing Wendy and her staff — which quickly grew from seven in the beginning to more than 70 at the pandemic’s height — at the tip of the spear, as it were.
To find out if you had it, or didn’t have it, and what you should do if you did or didn’t, you needed to talk to them.
Which brings us back to the trembling woman in the examination room last summer, a person so unnerved she could not control her body.
It didn’t help, Wendy adds, that she and her health department colleagues were dressed head to toe in gloves, masks, face shields and gowns — your basic hazmat suit.
“First thing we said was ‘Please don’t worry.’ We explained that what we were wearing was for her protection as well as ours. Then we talked about the procedure about to take place.”
If she were to test positive, it certainly didn’t mean she was going to die. The odds for a full recovery were very much on her side.
Wendy and her staff saw a lot of scared and fearful people like that over the past year. People who were imagining the worst; people who had to be talked in off the ledge.
A year later, she’s still seeing trembling.
But now it’s the good kind.
Just a few days ago, she was at the Davis County vaccination clinic when she saw a woman who was visibly shaking as she stood in line waiting for her shot.
“I went up to her and asked if she was OK,” says Wendy. “She said, ‘Oh, I’m not scared. I’m just so overwhelmed with joy and excitement that this day is finally here.’”
By no means is the COVID-19 threat over, Wendy quickly adds. “We know this is a disease that is going to be here forever. But with our vaccine and the intervention methods we’ve refined over the past year, we’re going to have more control over it going forward.”
Her workweeks are now in the 60-hour range, and dropping.
“We were seven days a week for a long time. Now we do not work on Sundays, so we’re making improvement,” she says, smiling.
“We have some wounds that need to heal, because it has been very, very hard. I know I prayed nightly asking for this to go away, it was just too much. But in the long run, now that you can look back, we all have grown as a result. We are better people in public health, we are better people as a community, we have better systems in place, we have an overall better response capability. I think whenever you go through things like this you often come out a little bruised and battered, but you also come out stronger than you ever realized you could be.”",2021-03-27T03:41:01Z,2021,1,8

Here are the details,Deseret News,2021-01-18T18:00:00Z,"A new COVID-19 variant has been discovered in Brazil following the discovery of two new variants in the United Kingdom and South Africa.
- The discovery raises concerns about public health experts, who are issuing warnings about new strains developing across the world.
What we know
Japan’s National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) said it found a new COVID-19 variant among four travelers from Brazil back on Jan. 2, according to CNBC.
- The NIID said the variant belongs to the B.1.1.248 COVID-19 strain and has 12 mutations in the spike protein, which are used for the virus to enter cells within the body, according to CNBC.
- Little data exists about whether or not the new variant is more infectious. And it’s unclear if any vaccine is effective against it.
Hopes on the vaccine
Brazil — one of the worst affected countries by COVID-19 — has placed hopes for stopping the pandemic on a COVID-19 vaccine from China that only has a 50.4% effective rate, The Washington Post reports.
- “The underwhelming results are a setback not only for Brazil, where more people have died of the virus than anywhere else outside the United States, but also for countries everywhere that have pinned their hopes on a vaccine that’s cheap, easily transported and ready for mass production,” according to The Washington Post. “It also clarified anew the role of global inequality in the spread of the disease.”",2021-01-18T18:00:00Z,2021,1,8

“I immediately laid everybody off,” she said. That meant all but one of her 15 employees.
Surviving the coronavirus pandemic as a small business has been particularly challenging. For those that were able to make it, that survival didn’t come without a lot of angst and at least a bit of help.
For longtime Salt Lake business owner Rasmussen and others, that good luck came in the form of the Paycheck Protection Program that was part of the federal government pandemic relief package last year. Now, many of those same business owners are hoping to access a few more of those federal dollars approved in another aid bill passed in December to keep their enterprises going a little while longer as the COVID-19 outbreak continues to wreak financial havoc throughout the state and the country.
Starting this week, small businesses hit hard by the pandemic have been able to apply or reapply for the Paycheck Protection Program — a forgivable loan program established by the 2020 Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act.
Rasmussen said she will be among those seeking another infusion of federal help.
“When (the government) first decided to shut down, my business fell off the cliff. (All my) corporate accounts except one — there were 43 of them — restaurants and hotels that do flowers every week,” Rasmussen said. “I lost 13 weddings. We had probably nine conventions set up and those slowly canceled throughout the year.”
Fortunately, the layoffs weren’t permanent.
“We came in as an essential business because we do funeral flowers, so me and my daughter-in-law ran it until I got the PPP and the minute I got (the money) I brought everybody back,” she said.
Since then, she has seen her business slowly recover though not to pre-pandemic levels. She estimated that she’s lost 20% of her revenue over the past year and is just making enough to get by at this point.
“I’m paying my bills and paying my employees but I’m not making any money,” Rasmussen said. “My profits are not staying the same. (But) I’m truly blessed because I’ve been around long enough that I’ve made it through three different recessions.
“I started in a recession. I always have backup,” she said. “I keep money in the business. If my business has money in it, I don’t take the money (in profits) I leave it there.”
She plans to apply for the same $70,000 amount she received during the first round of funding, believing it should be enough to sustain the business until vaccines allow life to become more normalized.
Meanwhile, local lenders are preparing for the new wave of of applicants when the new round of PPP funding becomes available. One difference expected for this round is a focus on involving community development financial institutions that serve small businesses rather than larger lenders that serve big companies and corporate clients, which is what drew criticism the first time around.
“Only the (community development financial institutions) are able to (accept applications) right now ... they were able to open up their portals and they were able to start accepting applications for first draws. (This week) they’ll be able to open up for second draws,” said Tom Morgan, executive vice president of retail banking at Zions Bank. The smaller local lenders can take first-time applicants and those like Rasmussen who will be applying a second time, having received money during the initial CARES Act funding.
The program will soon open to all other lenders at a date to be announced by the Small Business Administration, he said.
This time around, loans will be capped at $2 million, as opposed to $10 million previously. However, loans will cover additional expenses not previously allowed by PPP, such as for operations, property damage, supplier and worker protection expenditures.
The program’s eligibility is also expanding to include 501(c)(6) nonprofits, housing cooperatives and destination marketing organizations, among other types of entities.
“What this is doing is really spotlighting the idea that the SBA and the federal government really want to get the money to these small organizations, these smaller companies,” Morgan said. “They’ve even specifically set aside money for institutions that are very small — 10 employees or less — and in doing that, opening up to the small institutions first. That’s really targeting to get that money right to where they want it to go first.”
“It’s targeting the small small businesses. These are the ones that are at most risk. Since the spring of last year, these are the kinds of businesses that have gone out of business,” he said. “What (the SBA) wants is for those businesses that are still there is to get the lifesaving funds to those guys first.”
The new PPP provides greater flexibility for seasonal employees, according to Ryan Shaw, Zions Bank’s director of business banking. For first-time loan applicants, businesses with up to 500 employees are eligible, he added.
Some businesses and self-employed individuals can apply for a second PPP loan. However, to qualify, these businesses must have fewer than 300 employees and show a 25% loss for at least one quarter in 2020.
He said applicants will need documents to verify payroll costs and revenue loss, such as tax forms or bank statements.
Additionally, administrators have implemented new rules that will increase the time it will take to receive funds due to more stringent policies to prevent fraud.
“They have changed the way in which we’ll submit and apply and receive our authorizations,” Shaw said. “We don’t know exactly the time frame, but we know that it will take a little longer to get the authorizations from the SBA this time, and hence the funding might be a little slower than it was.”
Shaw noted that last time, some businesses received funding within 24 hours, but this round the timing will likely be just a few days rather than an extended period.
“By doing that they’ve also expanded the uses of funds that are eligible for this round. While 60% of the funds still needs to be used for payroll in order to receive the full forgiveness, they’ve expanded the other uses,” he said. “(It includes) rent mortgage interest, you can now pay for supplies and materials that your company purchases. You can buy (personal protective equipment) for your employees.”
“You can also pay for any damage to physical property that might have been caused by riots or unrest that might have happened in your area,” Shaw said. “The main goal obviously is to still have employees actively employed and paid, but they also realize there were other expenses that were being incurred by businesses.”",2021-01-16T18:30:00Z,2021,1,8

The Salt Lake Chamber is releasing its list of legislative priorities for the upcoming 2021 Legislature scheduled to run Jan. 19 through March 5. While the state’s economy has fared better than most, there are still lingering issues that need to be addressed before Utahns can begin to recover fully from the impact of the COIVD-19 outbreak, according to the organization’s top executive.
“We are still in the middle of the pandemic. We see the light at the end of the tunnel, the light is real,” said chamber President and CEO Derek Miller. “The vaccine is the real deal and we’re going to get through this pandemic, but for now that light is still just a pinpoint and we still have a long, dark tunnel to walk through.”
He said the most important thing that can be done for the economy has very little to do with traditional economics, but everything to do with combating the coronavirus.
“The No. 1 battle, right now, is vaccine distribution. The policy priority for us as it relates to getting through the pandemic is making sure that government works hand in hand with the business community ensuring that we have a well-thought-out and well-executed vaccine distribution,” he told the Deseret News. “Business, I believe, has an important role to play in this by communicating and developing confidence in our employees and being able to take the vaccine. Of course, the vaccine has to be available to them, so that’s on the government side.”
He said this year the chamber is dually focused on short-term recovery related to health care and equally focused on long-term prosperity regarding its legislative and business advocacy agenda.
“We’re really pleased to work closely with the Utah Department of Health, for example, on the ‘stay safe to stay open’ campaign,” he said. “We hope that we’ll be able to continue to work with state officials on the vaccine distribution.”
“Our message to the Legislature and this new governor administration in Utah had going into the pandemic the best-performing economy in the country. That was due to having the best business climate in the country,” Miller said. “Relatively speaking, our economy overall is still doing well. But let’s not do anything that would (harm) the very strong business climate that was built over the last 10 to 15 years.”
To that point, he said the group will ask for a moratorium on new business regulation.
“These businesses — especially small businesses — they’re spending every single day focused on keeping their doors open and keeping their people employed in jobs,” he said. “To add new regulatory burdens in that environment would just be a distraction. It would require them to take their eye off the ball and it would not be good for this fledgling economic recovery that we’re in.”
He added that infrastructure spending is really important in the category of bolstering economic recovery. There can also be tax incentives given to businesses that provide child care opportunities for employees, he said.
“That’s going to help more people be able to come back into the workforce,” Miller said. “It’s going to be especially important as some telecommuting opportunities change with people going back into actual offices.”
He said improved mass transportation is also a key ingredient to providing opportunities for low- and moderate-income individuals to get to and from work, which will enhance their ability to advance economically and have a positive impact on the environment.
Among the other high-priority issues are workforce development and education.
“We’re asking the Legislature and the governor’s office to help the business community work more closely with K-12, higher education, and to have specific programs that are again targeted to meet workforce shortages in specific industries,” he explained. “That’s going to mean more investment in some of our trades in our community colleges and focus on computer science training in every high school. Everything that we can do to help increase a skilled workforce is going to pay dividends for a long time to come.”
Lastly, Miller said the chamber is prioritizing efforts to address the issue of the growing affordable housing shortage along the Wasatch Front that is also spreading throughout the rest of the state.
“Housing affordability issue has been a priority of the chamber for several years,” he said. “To make an investment in more public transit, that’s going to help on the housing side because it’s going to help people to be able to access their jobs.”
“(Also), the construction industry throughout the pandemic — especially in multifamily housing — has been one where we’ve seen an uptick, so that’s probably a good sign and something that we need to keep going,” Miller said.",2021-01-12T16:55:45Z,2021,1,8

What’s going on?
Fauci spoke on the “Today” show on March 11 — the one-year anniversary of the day everything changed — about what went wrong with the pandemic and how the United States failed to stop the virus from mutating so much.
- “We had such divisiveness in our country that even simple commonsense public health measures took on a political connotation (with) people.”
Fauci said he would have been “shocked” if someone told him 500,000 people would die in the U.S. from COVID-19.
- “I did not — think that much worse was going to be 525,000 deaths.”
But Fauci said the pandemic has had a high point — the development of the COVID-19 vaccine.
- “If we really turn on the afterburners and get a lot of people vaccinated … by the time we get into the mid- to late summer, early fall, we’re going to start seeing a big, big difference.”
Flashback
Fauci testified before Congress on March 11, 2020, about the approaching storm of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Business Insider. It featured a key moment you may have missed.
- Chairwoman Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., asked Fauci: “Is the worst yet to come, Dr. Fauci?”
- Dr. Fauci responded: “Yes, it is.”
- Fauci then added: “Whenever you have an outbreak that you can start seeing community spread, which means by definition that you don’t know what the index case is and the way you can approach it is by contact tracing, when you have enough of that, then it becomes a situation where you’re not going to be able to effectively and efficiently contain it.”
Fauci said in March 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic would kill 100,000 to 200,000 Americans and infect millions, according to NPR.
- “I just don’t think that we really need to make a projection when it’s such a moving target, that you could so easily be wrong,” Fauci told CNN at the time.",2021-03-11T21:00:00Z,2021,1,8

- The coronavirus vaccines currently available require two doses for full effectiveness. The second shot happens about 21 days after the first shot.
What happened to Fauci
Fauci said Thursday that the second round of the COVID-19 vaccine knocked him out for an entire day, something that he wished hadn’t happened, according to The Hill.
- “I had it on the 19th. I was hoping that I wouldn’t get too knocked out. I did for about 24 hours. Now I’m fine,” Fauci told reporters Thursday.
- “Fatigued. A little achy. You know. Chilly. Not sick,” Fauci added.
Why the second dose matters
University of Utah Health Division of Infectious Diseases associate professor Dr. Emily Spivak told the Deseret News that it’s important to get both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine so you can be fully protected against the virus.
- “The whole point of the second dose is to boost the sort of the amount of antibody and the amount of immunity that you have and hopefully the length. We just don’t even know how long the protection is after two doses,” Spivak said.",2021-01-24T14:00:00Z,2021,1,8

When will third COVID-19 shots come out?
Both CEOs from Moderna and Pfizer — the two developers of the common COVID-19 vaccines — told Axios that recent data suggests the “booster” shots will be available (and needed) by the fall.
- “The data that I see coming, they are supporting the notion that likely there will be a need for a booster somewhere between eight and 12 months,” Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said, according to Axios.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House chief medical adviser on COVID-19, told Axios that the third shot will likely be necessary.
- “I think we will almost certainly require a booster sometime within a year or so after getting the primary (shot) because the durability of protection against coronaviruses is generally not lifelong,” Fauci said, according to Axios.
Who gets the third COVID shot first?
Pfizer’s chief scientific officer, Mikael Dolsten, told CNBC in May that the third shot will be given out to those in need first.
- Dolsten predicts “those with chronic diseases that make them more vulnerable to severe illness and hospitalization, such as cardiovascular disease or asthma” will get the third booster shot first, CNBC reports.
Per CBS News, U.S. officials have started figuring out how to roll out the third vaccine shot to those who already got two shots of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.

https://www.deseret.com/2021/6/8/22463193/keep-your-proof-of-vaccinations-handy-digital-apps-track-vaccinations/,Opinion: Keep your proof of vaccinations handy and digital,Deseret News,2021-06-08T20:00:00Z,"Nearly half of all Americans age 12 and older are now fully vaccinated for COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That means hundreds of millions of people are in possession of white vaccination cards that are too big to fit in a wallet or phone case.
Which begs the question, do you desire to have proof of vaccination with you at all times? I do, for the same reason I always have a current passport: just in case. But as someone who does not carry a purse or wallet, I have decided to carry my immunization record with me digitally.
Of course the easiest, quickest way is to simply take a photo of the card. But digital apps are a good solution for those looking for ways to keep track of all their vaccinations, not just those for COVID-19.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last month that the private sector will take the lead in creating digital ways to store that information, Reuters reported.
“There will be no centralized universal federal vaccinations database, and no federal mandate requiring everyone to obtain a single vaccination credential,” she said.
Which means local governments, businesses and other organizations will decide whether to use a digital immunization app for proof of vaccinations, and which one to use.
U.S. News and World Report points out many states, including Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Texas, South Carolina and others that “have issued executive orders prohibiting vaccine passports/requirements in some regard,” according to James Nash, press secretary for the National Governors Association.
But other state and local governments have already put immunization apps into action.
New York State is using the Excelsior Pass app for residents to have quick access to immunization records. Fans can already use the app for entry to the KeyBank Center for National Hockey League games.
Alaska is launching MyIR Mobile for people to keep track of vaccination records. Alaska Public Media reports tens of thousands of people in several other states have been using the platform for years for access to their records.
I received my second COVID-19 shot in May. The Utah state health department handed me a flyer afterward with information about an immunization records app right at the top. My state has partnered with the Docket app to allow Utahns access to the state’s immunization registries.
To sign in to the app, you need to give your name, birth date and legal sex. It quickly found my records but wanted to verify my identity by sending a code to a phone number. The problem was that they had some old home phone number of mine that no longer exists. My only other option was to say that the phone number didn’t look familiar. Although that wasn’t true, I clicked it. The app then told me to contact my health care provider, pharmacist, health department or school nurse to get a PIN I could input instead.
If you run into this same situation, here are helpful hints when you make that phone call.
- Tell the person to whom you inquire that the app is looking for your Utah Statewide Immunization System (USIIS) PIN.
- Once I received that PIN from my local health department and entered it into the app, all my immunization records popped up. It will tell you when you received each immunization and whether you have one due.
- Users can add the records of any children under age 18 to their account as well.
The app is encrypted and HIPAA compliant.
Docket says on the app that you can use the app “to provide proof of immunizations as needed (e.g. back to school season).”
But there’s no guarantee the app will be accepted anywhere, including your school. Although the app does allow you to print out or share useful immunization forms with all of your info.
Jenny Johnson with the Utah Department of Health told me the app is most useful as a simple way for consumers to have access to their records.
“Just because you can use this app, if someone is requiring proof of vaccination, I’m not sure a school would accept someone showing a mobile app for verification,” she said.
She pointed out it is up to individual companies or destinations or organizations to decide whether they will accept certain types of vaccine verifications, including digital ones.
I have yet to go anywhere where proof of a COVID-19 vaccination is necessary, but for now I will keep my Docket app handy with the records it has from my state’s immunization registries. I will also keep a photo of my COVID-19 vaccination card in my camera roll.
And I will rejoice that I no longer have to dig through my filing cabinet for those yellow immunization cards ever again.

https://www.deseret.com/u-s-world/2021/4/6/22369811/stimulus-check-update-fourth-payment/,Will there be a fourth stimulus check?,Deseret News,2021-04-06T21:30:00Z,"Millions of Americans received their third stimulus check already, and many more are starting to see them float into their bank accounts.
But is there a chance of a fourth stimulus check? It remains unclear, but the seeds are already there for a fourth stimulus payment.
The political battle over a fourth stimulus check
A group of lawmakers has called for another stimulus check payment. For example, Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont all sent a letter to President Joe Biden that requested Americans receive “recurring direct payments and automatic unemployment insurance extensions tied to economic conditions.”
Similarly, 53 representatives sent a letter to President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris that requested more payments.
- “Recurring direct payments until the economy recovers will help ensure that people can meet their basic needs, provide racially equitable solutions, and shorten the length of the recession,” the letter said, according to Politico.
But, according to CBS Detroit, it’s unlikely there will be a fourth stimulus check because the United States is making progress against the novel coronavirus.
- Vaccinations are improving across the country, which could lead to improvements for the economy, which is already being helped by the third stimulus check.
- “The ongoing vaccinations, which will eventually allow hard-hit parts of the economy to safely reopen, certainly help,” according to CBS News. “All that additional spending, along with the release of pent-up demand, should lead to more jobs as companies hire to address consumer needs. With the economy opened up, a fourth round of stimulus checks becomes less necessary.”
You might have received a fourth stimulus check, sort of
Some Americans did receive a new “plus-up” payment in their bank accounts, as I wrote for the Deseret News. These people received the payment because they filed their 2020 income taxes, which might have changed their earnings, making them qualify for more money under the stimulus check qualifications.
- “That includes those who received a stimulus check based on their 2019 tax returns, but who are eligible for more money now that their 2020 returns have been processed,” according to CNBC.",2021-04-06T21:30:00Z,2021,2,9

Utahns say they’ll take the money, but they don’t really need it",Deseret News,2021-04-08T04:00:00Z,"Are Utahns experiencing COVID-19 stimulus fatigue?
Maybe not, but data from a new Deseret News-Hinckley Institute of Politics poll shows over half of residents don’t consider the latest, and most generous, round of stimulus checks to be that big a deal.
The survey, conducted by Scott Rasmussen on March 26-31 of 1,000 registered Utah voters, found that 54% of respondents rated the third round of stimulus checks/direct deposits that started going out last month as either “not very” or “not at all” important to their current financial situations. The poll has a 3.1% margin of error.
So far, the federal government has disbursed three rounds of checks to individuals with the goal of stimulating spending amid recession conditions wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Last March, following passage of the nearly $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, many U.S. taxpayers became eligible for payments that provided $1,200 for each eligible adult and $500 for each dependent child.
In December, another round of “economic impact” payments went out, this time granting $600 to each eligible adult and $600 per dependent child. And, most recently, the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan provided funding for $1,400 checks to adults and another $1,400 to children. Each plan came with earnings caps on full stimulus payments that ranged from $80,000-$99,000 for single filers and $160,000-$198,000 for those filing joint returns.
And even though a solid majority of Utahns may not be in dire need of the most recent wave of federal assistance, 46% of those polled said the money was going to be “very” or “somewhat” important to their personal financial affairs.
Among those was Bree Robinson of Beaver.
Robinson, 43, said even though pandemic restrictions resulted in a severe slowdown of her family’s collision repair business, they were able to navigate the hardships through frugality and tightening up the budget. And while she has yet to see the latest round of stimulus money, it’s expected and the money will go into savings, as have the first two payments of federal assistance they’ve received.
Robinson works as a teacher’s aid, but is also part of the family repair business, which is headed by her husband and also includes two of their teenage daughters among the staff.
Robinson said she’s grateful to have the money as backup, particularly as rising gas prices are impacting company expenses. She is also anticipating business tax rates could go up under the new administration.
“Being self-employed changes things,” Robinson said. “When taxes fluctuate and fuel fluctuates it has a really big impact on our business.”
Robinson said that while business volume at the repair shop is almost back to where it was before the COVID-19 outbreak, she and her husband are happy to have the backup savings the stimulus funding has provided to help ensure “we can come out of this in good shape.”
Personal saving habits have skyrocketed amid COVID-19 conditions, a fact noted by JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon in a panel discussion earlier this week. Dimon, who runs the largest financial institution in the world when measured by market capitalization, said in a conversation with former Utah Gov. and U.S. Ambassador Jon Huntsman Jr. that Americans had grown their personal savings and checking account balances by some $2 trillion over pre-pandemic levels, and that’s even before the latest round of stimulus cash.
When pollsters asked Utahns who had received stimulus checks how they’d used or planned to use the cash, savings came in third with 20%, just behind paying down debt (23%) and paying bills including rent or utilities (21%). Home improvement projects also made the top four responses with 10% of respondents saying they planned to plough the money into their abodes.
Utah results were very similar to national data collected by the U.S. Census Bureau in February that also asked how people were planning on putting stimulus money to work.
The Household Pulse Survey allowed respondents to make multiple choices, but of the sample set of 110 million Americans, some 52% said paying down debt would be among their top priorities, followed by 44% prioritizing paying household-related expense and 19% saying it would go into savings.
Murray resident Jay Lalik, 40, was at ground zero of the early COVID-19 economic impacts, losing his restaurant job amid statewide restrictions on public gatherings. A follow-up gig with Amazon wasn’t a good fit, but Lalik is now with a private security firm.
He said the stimulus checks he’s received were not unappreciated but he isn’t a fan of handouts. And, he also felt compelled to bank the money as a hedge against cost-of-living increases, which he said are already becoming apparent in Utah.
“The money wasn’t vital, and I’m usually kind of averse to this type of thing,” Lalik said. “But with all the money that’s just being printed right now, I felt like I had to have it just to keep up with inflation.”
Lalik said he believes the economy will continue to pick up as restrictions are reduced and vaccination rates continue to rise, and he sees a positive road ahead for his personal financial outlook. But he is also concerned by indicators, like recent gas price increases, that may portend higher prices on everything in the not-too-distant future.
“I know the (Federal Reserve) has a lot of tools to keep inflation at just a few percentage points,” Lalik said. “But watching how fast fuel prices are going up seems like a sign that we’re going to see ... even more price increases.”",2021-04-08T04:00:00Z,2021,2,9
https://www.deseret.com/2021/5/11/22431273/broadway-reopening-when-is-it-what-broadway-shows-will-return/,A new ‘Harry Potter and the Cursed Child’ is coming to Broadway,Deseret News,2021-07-12T22:30:37Z,"“Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” is one of the latest productions to announce a return to Broadway — although the show will look a little different than it did before the pandemic.
“Cursed Child” opened on Broadway in 2018 and is a sequel of sorts to J.K. Rowling’s “Harry Potter” series, according to People. The story takes place 19 years after the original “Harry Potter” series and follows the children of Harry, Ginny, Ron, Hermione and Draco Malfoy as they embark on studies at Hogwarts, Entertainment Weekly reported.
The production was originally performed in two separate performances, but upon its Nov. 12 reopening, it will be condensed into one play, People reported. The original version will continue to run in London, according to Broadway.com.
“Given the challenges of remounting and running a two-part show in the U.S. on the scale of ‘Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,’ and the commercial challenges faced by the theater and tourism industries emerging from the global shutdowns, we are excited to be able to move forward with a new version of the play that allows audiences to enjoy the complete ‘Cursed Child’ adventure in one sitting eight times a week,” the show’s producers said in a statement, according to Entertainment Weekly.
“The Book of Mormon” musical also recently announced its return to Broadway.
Deadline has reported that “The Book of Mormon” musical will return to Broadway on Nov. 5 — and that there could be some changes to the production. Following Black Lives Matter protests last summer, the musical came under scrutiny for its depiction of Africans.
Last year, Josh Gad — one of the original cast members — said the musical needed to “adjust with the times,” the Deseret News reported.
In light of Gad’s comments, Cheryl Hystad, a retired attorney who wrote an opinion piece about the musical’s “blatant racism” for The Baltimore Sun, told the Deseret News she believed the pandemic shutdown would be a good time for Broadway producers to “really look critically at the racist aspects of it and try to figure out a way to really counter that narrative.”
“I think the show’s going to die out at some point soon if they don’t do something to kind of address some of these issues,” she told the Deseret News.
According to Deadline, “The Book of Mormon” musical writers resume rehearsals with the cast in the fall and have agreed to possibly adjust parts of the show “deemed racially problematic.” Any changes made would also apply to productions of the musical elsewhere.
Other Broadway updates
Broadway also recently announced that a limited engagement of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s improv-rap musical “Freestyle Love Supreme” will run Oct. 7 through Jan. 2, 2022.
In early June, Broadway announced that Bruce Springsteen’s autobiographical show, “Springsteen on Broadway,” would officially mark the industry’s return from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The production, which is primarily a solo show by the “Born in the U.S.A.” singer, will now be the first to open on Broadway since the pandemic shut down performances in March 2020, The New York Times has reported.
“Springsteen on Broadway” intertwines the singer’s hits with stories about how the songs came together. The production, which premiered in 2017, re-opens on June 26 and will have performances through Sept. 4, according to The New York Times.
Audience members are required to show proof of full COVID-19 vaccination, according to Broadway World.
When is Broadway reopening?
In early May, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Broadway would reopen to full capacity beginning Sept. 14, 2021, according to the New York Theater Guide website.
At the time of reopening, Broadway will have been closed for a year and a half. The closure — which came after a year when Broadway earned $1.8 billion from ticket sales — forced a temporary end to 31 plays and musicals, including popular productions like “Hamilton” and “The Lion King,” the Deseret News reported.
The shutdown also affected the debut of new musicals — 16 openings alone were scheduled between March 12 and April 23, 2020, according to The New York Times.
“We had such a good year before the shutdown, but now we need the ability to reignite the energy that we were sailing on,” Tom Hulce, a lead producer of the Temptations musical “Ain’t Too Proud,” told The New York Times. “We basically are starting from zero advance, as most shows are, and now we need time to reach out and build back up.”
What Broadway shows are coming back?
Approximately 30 shows are currently planning to resume before the end of 2021, with half opening as soon as September, The New York Times reported.
On May 11, three of Broadway’s biggest shows announced they will be ready for the Sept. 14 curtain rise. Stars from “Hamilton,” “The Lion King” and “Wicked” appeared on “Good Morning America” to announce the return.
- “That moment already in ‘Circle of Life’ is an iconic moment, and from pride rock I have a different special viewpoint,” “Lion King” performer L. Steven Taylor told “Good Morning America.” “From Rafiki’s opening call, it’s really a call for the community to come together, and I feel like that’s what this is symbolic of, Broadway coming back is it’s really a community coming back and making New York really start to go.”

https://www.deseret.com/2021/4/30/22380466/movie-theaters-return-box-office-numbers/,The box office is back,Deseret News,2021-06-02T04:02:22Z,"“A Quiet Place II” has absolutely smashed the box office so far this weekend with a $57 million debut, which is about in line with what a movie would make before the pandemic even began.
Why the film’s earnings are “particularly notable is that they are roughly in line with what the movie was projected to make prior to the pandemic. That, of course, never played out according to plan,” according to NBC News.
Not to be outdone, “Cruella” — Disney’s new live-action film that was also released (for a price) on Disney+ — earned $26.5 million over the weekend, too, according to NBC News. It’s unclear how many people downloaded it on the streaming service, though.
And then there’s “Wrath of Man,” the R-rated action film with star Jason Statham that drew $22.8 million in its own right.
So it seems, in short, people are returning to movies.
Now let’s not forget — movie theaters have been open for a while. It was last summer when we started to see the major chains — from AMC to Cinemark to Regal — begin opening their doors to customers who wanted to watch a movie during the pandemic. Only a few major new movies have come out — from “Tenet” to “Mulan” to the recent ones like “Godzilla vs. Kong” and the upcoming “Mortal Kombat.”
The United States is at an odd point in the coronavirus pandemic. As vaccinations continue, about one-third of the country has been vaccinated against the novel coronavirus. Some people are taking off their masks and spending time with friends indoors, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends. Others still wait for their COVID-19 shots. We also don’t know who has or hasn’t been vaccinated.
The American movie theater is open, but there are almost no new movies to see. And the movies that are available are either local films, religious holiday spectacles or some low-end blockbuster films that didn’t get the luxury of the big-time release.
Right now, summer blockbusters — the Marvel films, the “Fast and the Furious” saga and so many other big pictures we’d see right now — remain hidden behind studios’ film reels.
Soon, those films will be back. “Black Widow” comes out in July. “F9” is scheduled for next month. Major productions will soon be back in the box office. And, assuming millions are vaccinated and the coronavirus had been defeated, people will come back en masse to the theaters.
What it’s been like during the pandemic
Megaplex Theatres — a movie theater chain that had its beginnings in Utah but has expanded to Idaho and Nevada — has been one of the few movie theaters to remain open during the entire pandemic. The theater chain has done things outside of just showing movies. It’s hosted food and toy drives, became a polling place during the 2020 election and most recently, has used its theater locations as vaccination sites for the coronavirus vaccines.
But at the end of the day, the theater chain is still a theater chain. And lately, Megaplex has seen more and more people filter into showings.
“Our team at Megaplex enjoys watching movie fans reenter the theater for the first time since coming out of quarantine,” said Blake Andersen, Megaplex Theatres president. “We’ve seen guests tear up as they see the flashing lights surrounding the movie posters or catch a whiff of freshly popped popcorn. We appreciate the comments as guests tell us how much they have missed coming to Megaplex and consider the theaters a ‘home away from home.’”
Should we go back to the movies?
Megaplex understands navigating the waters of a post-pandemic world will be difficult. When do you get rid of masks? Do you require vaccination cards? So many questions surround the return to the movies. Megaplex plans to work with the state of Utah as it makes its decisions.
“We’ll continue to work closely with state and local experts, as well as industry sources, to help us identify the best time to expand our capacity. Our goal is to provide guests the best and safest entertainment experience possible,” Andersen told the Deseret News.
The theater chain will still follow the guidelines set out from the National Organization of Theatre Owners (NATO), which announced the Cinema Safe pledge early in the pandemic. It also follows the guidelines created by the Utah Cinema Promise. These promises aim to create a clean and safe environment for people to see movies in theaters.
There are still questions about whether movie theaters are safe. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House medical adviser on the coronavirus, said he wouldn’t attend movie theaters yet, according to Yahoo News.
“I don’t think I would — even if I’m vaccinated — go into an indoor, crowded place where people are not wearing masks,” Fauci said.
That said, there’s an argument to be made that movie theaters — especially with reduced capacity — are safer than restaurants. In a movie theater, you wear your mask and you don’t talk. Maybe you take it off for popcorn or soda. But you’re not making noise, for the most part. At restaurants, you’re talking, laughing, slobbering all over your food. There’s more of a chance for the virus to get out there. This is the basic version of the argument that Derek Thompson of The Atlantic has made for quite some time. The risk is low at a movie theater, and yet there’s a constant fear about going to see a movie there. Maybe we’re not ready for a packed theater like we would have seen for “Avengers: Endgame.” But a quiet movie on a Sunday where there are maybe three other people? Seems safe enough if you’ve been vaccinated. Of course, science needs to be considered.
The future of movie theaters
Safety aside — there’s also a huge storm cloud looming over movie theaters right now, almost literally. Streaming has taken a turn for the better since movie theaters closed. We’ve known about the coming battle between streaming and movie theaters for years. Netflix has tried to release new movies on its platform, and movie theaters have kept an eye on streaming to make sure the releases weren’t exclusive to those platforms.
The pandemic changed all of that. Now, we have new movies released directly on streaming platforms for those who don’t want to watch in a movie theater. Disney+ released “Mulan” through streaming — for an additional $30 fee — and plans to do the same for “Black Widow.” Meanwhile, Warner Bros said it would release all of its biggest films on HBO Max and in theaters at the same time. We’ve seen this already with “Godzilla vs. Kong” and “Wonder Woman 1984.”
So what happens next? Movie theaters will bring people back, sure, But it’s anyone’s guess what this means for the streaming platforms. Will the current status hold where films are released on streaming and in movie theaters? Or will streaming be held back and studios will go theater-exclusive?
The future remains wide open for what’s next.
But the return to the movies might not happen until 2022. Sure, movies will continue to hit the box office for the rest of 2021. But the uncertainty of the virus and its variants, as well as the vaccination rollout, might mean there won’t be a full return until next year.
B. Riley’s analyst Eric Wold told Deadline he doesn’t see a huge boom for the box office until 2022. It’s at that point that people will feel comfortable returning to the theaters.
People feel similarly. About 46% of people surveyed by MKM Partners said they’d return to the movies within the next three months. But close to 72% said they’d prefer returning to the theaters in six months (clearly there are some people who said both three and six months work for them), according to ComicBook.com.
Is there something for theaters to take away from all of this? Of course. The movie theater will always have demand. It offers something different than your couch and your home. For the last year, people have been cooped up in the small confines of their homes, waiting for the pandemic to end.
The movie theater will be one escape for people that won’t end on a cliffhanger.
“At Megaplex Theatres, we’re more determined now than ever before to ensure the best guest experience possible,” Andersen said. “People continue to have a variety of entertainment options.

Experts are concerned, as more than double the expected number of mosquitoes hatched north of Salt Lake City this May. A recent survey by the Salt Lake City Mosquito Abatement District measured 960 mosquitoes in the rural zone — a sharp deviation from the 400 expected from an average of the last five years.
This sharp increase is likely due to the melting snow from mountains around the Salt Lake Valley that is trickling down into marshier areas at their base. The water stays there, impounded and stagnant, and becomes a perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes as temperatures warm.
The industrial surveillance zone, housed between Salt Lake City International Airport and state Route 201, also saw a 75% increase in mosquitoes over the average. Any of these mosquitoes could be carrying West Nile virus, and the only way the Department of Health can tell this is through population surveillance and testing.
Unlike last year, when COVID-19 complicated the process of testing for West Nile in mosquitoes, testing is anticipated to continue as usual throughout the summer, as more broods hatch and more of the department’s employees get vaccinated.
As of Thursday’s West Nile testing update, no cases have been reported in mosquito pools or in humans.
“We don’t want people stressing out and staying indoors all summer,” said Hannah Rettler, zoologist and vector-borne epidemiologist with the Utah Department of Health. “We just want people to be aware of mosquito areas. It’s about knowing what your risk is and knowing how to protect yourself. Then there’s no need to sit and actively worry.”
This year vs. last
Though West Nile only infected two Utahns in 2020, Ary Faraji, executive director of the Salt Lake City Mosquito Abatement District, said that due to the nature of both West Nile virus and the mosquitoes that carry it, one year of few cases means little for the next year.
“A lot of these viruses are cyclical in nature,” Faraji said. “Some years may have a lot of positive cases, and in some years, by natural ecological cycles or intervention, we see reduced activity. But these pathogens are never going away.”
In fact, the cyclical tendency of the disease is one of the main reasons it seems to be “forgotten” come summer. Residents may remember a slew of good years, trek out into nature as the temperature rises, and keep mosquitoes in the back of their mind until they’re faced with one, Faraji said. By then, it’s too late to go back and grab repellent, and one bite can be enough for a potentially dangerous infection.
West Nile virus is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito, but the disease itself isn’t in a state to infect most humans right now. It has to be maintained between bird-biting mosquitoes and birds; an infected mosquito bites a bird, which amplifies the disease, and then another noninfected mosquito contracts the amplified disease from that same bird, amplifying it again in turn. This positive feedback loop means that it will take a few months before the virus builds up in mosquito pools. According to Faraji, we likely won’t see infected pools until the end of June.
This isn’t to say that the virus cannot be circulated before then, however, especially in high-risk groups. The point of testing in the early months of May is to see the field infection rate of transmission, or how fast the disease is spread among mosquitoes. If they reach a threshold of infected pools of mosquitoes, the abatement districts will need to increase control efforts to stop transmission. These efforts can include setting traps, managing water drainage systems to remove standing water, and physical screens on rain barrels to control the amount of larvae and pupae gestating in them.
What’s the harm?
Unlike the novel coronavirus, there is no vaccine to prevent West Nile virus, nor are there medications designed to pinpoint the disease itself. Some symptoms of the infection, like a fever or headache, can be treated with bedrest, intake of fluid, and over-the-counter pain relievers.
However, about 1 out of 150 infected people develop serious symptoms, which can include muscle weakness, convulsions, vision loss, numbness and death. Individuals above 50 are at greater risk, along with those who have certain medical conditions or have received organ transplants.
“We may experience reduced transmission or reduced cases,” Faraji said. “But because of the fact that it’s still out there, we need to be vigilant, have an established control program, and educate the public on what they can do to reduce personal risk.”
Tips for avoiding mosquito bites and potential exposure to West Nile virus:
- Avoid areas with high mosquito sightings. If you’re planning an outing during dawn or dusk, check the mosquito surveillance map and see if your location is at risk.
- Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants, and apply a repellent approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to exposed areas of skin, especially during dusk and dawn, when mosquitoes are more likely to bite.
- Run a pump on your private swimming pool or pond. If you do not have a pump, call your local mosquito abatement district, which can provide pumps and mosquito-eating fish to naturally reduce the population.
- If you have a bird bath, dump out its water at least every five days.
- Fix your screen door if you see a tear or puncture.
- Put containers that accumulate water through rain or a sprinkler system inside, especially during peak mosquito hours.
- Report bodies of stagnant water in your neighborhood to a local mosquito abatement district.",2021-05-30T02:12:15Z,2021,2,9

Per CNN, the model predicts that 618,523 people will die from the novel coronavirus by Aug. 1.
- However, if 95% of Americans wore masks when they’re around other people, the number would drop down to 604,413 deaths.
- That suggests wearing masks would save close to 14,000 lives.
How fully-vaccinated impact COVID-19 numbers
The projection said the number of deaths would jump up to 697,573 if “fully vaccinated people return to pre-pandemic levels of mobility,” according to CNN.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the country’s top infectious disease experts, told Business Insider that vaccines aren’t perfect, and fully vaccinated people should still wear masks and follow public health guidelines.
- “I don’t think I would — even if I’m vaccinated — go into an indoor, crowded place where people aren’t wearing masks,” Fauci told Business Insider.
Dr. Todd Vento, an Intermountain Healthcare infectious diseases doctor, told the Deseret News in March that vaccinations don’t matter. We’re still in a pandemic and people should act as such.
- “You should continue to say, ‘If I’m out in public, I should probably be careful,’” he said.
- “I know we’ve changed a lot, like we’ve accepted a lot more tolerance because folks want to get back to work and want to have normal. The reality that is in front of us is the reality we have to address, not the reality we want it to be. We have to work toward that reality,” he said.",2021-04-13T14:00:00Z,2021,2,9

- The free rides — which will start in the next two weeks — are a part of Biden’s plan to get 70% of the United States vaccinated with at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, according to Axios.
- The Biden administration will offer information on 80,000 vaccination sites to Lyft and Uber so they can bring people to those locations, according to The Wall Street Journal.
How do you get a free ride to the vaccination site?
Uber and Lyft will have a new feature that will allow people to “simply select a vaccination site near them, follow simple directions to redeem their ride, and then get a ride to take them to and from a nearby vaccination site free of charge,” according to a White House briefing.
Lyft said it would send out a code for people to get a ride to a vaccination site, according to CNBC. The codes would cover the $15 cost of the ride each way.
Statements from Uber and Lyft
- Lyft co-founder and president John Zimmer: “The vaccine is the key to getting us all moving again, and we’re proud to do our part to move the country forward. We’ve always believed transportation has the power to improve people’s lives, and this initiative makes that truer than ever. Helping more Americans get vaccinated helps the Lyft community of drivers and riders, and we’re grateful to the Biden administration for prioritizing access.”
- Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi: “Vaccines are our best hope to beat this pandemic and soon everyone in America will be able to take a free Uber to get their shot. We are honored to deepen our previous global commitments, and partner with the White House and Lyft to provide free rides to vaccination sites across the U.S. This is a proud moment for me, for Uber, and for our country. More and more Americans continue to get vaccinated every day — let’s keep moving forward, together.”",2021-05-11T18:30:00Z,2021,2,9

Cox: State incentives to get COVID-19 vaccine still possible as delta variant spreads in Utah,Deseret News,2021-06-17T19:07:03Z,"State incentives for Utahns who get the COVID-19 vaccine may yet happen, Gov. Spencer Cox said Thursday.
“I think there is a possibility,” the governor said during the taping of his monthly news conference on PBS Utah, confirming that discussions with the Utah Legislature’s Republican leadership are continuing despite their initial reluctance to support the type of giveaways that at least 24 other states are offering to encourage vaccinations.
Cox also raised concerns about the spread in Utah of what’s now known as the delta variant of the coronavirus, first detected in India. The variant, causing rises in cases in other parts of the world, was first identified in Utah late last month, and 42 cases have been found so far, according to the Utah Department of Health.
“The delta variant is here. We believe that the delta variant is growing,” the governor said, adding he expects more cases to be reported Friday, but not among those who have been vaccinated against the deadly virus, even as overall COVID-19 cases are increasing slightly and younger, healthier Utahns are being stricken.
“Scientists have found it is a more contagious variant that is easily spread and also lasts a little longer and can be a little more damaging to people,” he said. “The good news is, the vaccines work against the delta variant, they work just as well against the delta variant as the other variants, so we really can protect people.”
But without the shots, Utahns are vulnerable to hospitalization and even death, the governor warned.
“The answer, as always, is to get vaccinated. There are people younger than age 50 in our hospitals right now on oxygen. These are people with no prior health conditions and they can’t breathe well enough on their own and are requiring hospitalization because they were not vaccinated,” he said. “It’s very sad.”
Then there are the conversations Cox said he’s had “multiple times” in recents weeks with people whose loved ones are hospitalized “in dire circumstances” or have even died “because they’ve refused to get vaccinated. Completely preventable.”
The goal, the governor said, is for 70% of the state’s adults to have gotten at least one dose of vaccine by July 4. Currently, 63.4% of all Utahns 18 and older have met that mark, and 55.6% are fully vaccinated, meaning it’s been two weeks since their final dose.
“It’s looking like we’re not going to get there unless we have a big surge of vaccinations over the next couple of weeks. We’re hoping that will happen. We’re pulling out all the stops to make that happen,” he said. So far, however, that does not include offering state incentives, although those are still in the works.
“We have had conversations with legislative leadership around the potential for some sort of incentive or inducement for people to get the vaccination. There hasn’t been much interest in that, but it is correct that we continue to have those discussions,” Cox said.
That would not be a violation of state law or the Utah Constitution, which prohibits lawmakers from authorizing “any game of chance, lottery or gift enterprise under any pretense or for any purpose,” the governor said, adding, “I don’t think there are any legal issues around that.”
Utah Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, however, has said he believes a lottery would violate the state constitution. Cox had wanted Utah to follow the trend started by Ohio’s “Vax-a-Million” lottery that’s giving away $1 million cash prizes and full-ride state college scholarships in weekly drawings.
Now, though, the talks between the governor and legislative leaders are focused on some other type of giveaway, such as gift cards or discounts. Although the Biden administration has said vaccine incentives could be paid for out of federal COVID-19 relief funds, Cox said Thursday he’d like to see Utah’s business community offer more.
“We’ve seen that nationally to some extent,” the governor said, with companies like Krispy Kreme giving away donuts to vaccinated customers. “I would love to see more of that locally. If we can help just those people who are kind of on the fence right now, to get them closer” to choosing to be vaccinated against the virus.
The state, along with the Salt Lake Chamber, have contacted 10,000 businesses around Utah, urging them to offer opportunities and incentives to get the shots. Derek Miller, the chamber’s president and CEO, has said he hopes lawmakers will consider using some of the federal dollars to boost Utah’s vaccination rate.",2021-06-17T19:07:03Z,2021,2,9

Concerns over COVID-19 Delta variant
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House chief medical adviser on the coronavirus, recently warned that the Delta variant, which was first discovered in India, could present the biggest danger for a return to normal.
Per CNBC, Fauci said the Delta variant has been spreading wildly in the U.K. But letting it spread in the U.S. would not be a good idea.
- “In the U.K., the Delta variant is rapidly emerging as the dominant variant. ... It is replacing the B.1.1.7,” Fauci said, according to CNBC. “We cannot let that happen in the United States.”
Fauci recommends people get vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to stop dangerous variants from spreading.
COVID-19 vaccine concerns
Misinformation has been spreading wildly about the COVID-19 vaccine. Dr. Jonathan Reiner, who works as a CNN medical analyst, told CNN it’s not great that people are hearing misinformation about the vaccine.

So how do experts feel?
Is Disneyland safe?
Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a professor in the UCSF Health Division of Infectious Diseases, recently told SF Gate that the park is relatively safe for most people.
- “Given the social distancing and especially the mask mandates, people will be generally safe,” he said. “The burden of COVID-19 in the state is very low right now, so chances of transmission events happening is low.”
Chin-Hong said the constant COVID-19 tests for cast members help stop cases from spreading throughout the park. Some of the other measures that Disney has added — like temperature checks — don’t really help too much.
- “Temperature checks and enhanced cleaning are nice, but less important from a disease transmission perspective,” he said.
Disneyland is currently only open to California residents, too, in order to keep people safe and away from the virus.
Changes to Disneyland COVID-19 rules
California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s new “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” plan could allow for people outside of California to visit events and theme parks like Disneyland, according to the OC Register. Disneyland would need to change its own rules to make it happen.
The California Attractions and Parks Association, which represents California theme parks like Disneyland, said the California theme parks might change their rules, as I wrote for the Deseret News.
- “This addendum now allows fully vaccinated persons from out of state to visit or attend activities or events that were previously restricted to in-state visitors,” the CAPA said in a statement, according to the OC Register. “As vaccinations become more widespread and state guidance evolves, individual parks may update their own responsible reopening plans in accordance with state and local public health regulations.”",2021-04-27T13:00:00Z,2021,2,9

National Institutes of Health director Dr. Francis Collins recently told CNN that there are still tens of millions of Americans who haven’t been vaccinated yet against the coronavirus.
- Collins told CNN that “a lot of those folks are still not sure that they want to take part in this amazing opportunity to put this virus behind us.”
- “We have to really figure out how to get the messages out there so that those who are still undecided get the information they need to see why this is really something they would want to do.”
Vaccine supply and demand
Collins’ comments come as a new report from the Kaiser Family Foundation suggested the U.S. will soon reach a “tipping point where vaccine supply will outlast demand,” meaning everyone who wants the vaccine will have gotten it and focus will turn toward encouraging those who are hesitant to get vaccinated.
Collins told CNN the U.S. will have a better shot of ending the pandemic if more people get vaccinated.
- “If we’re going to get past this terrible pandemic, it’s going to take most of us being immunized. Otherwise, the virus can just keep going on and on,” Collins said, according to CNN.
Vaccine wall, explained
Earlier in April, an analysis from Surgo Ventures — a global health foundation that provides data for health policies — suggested that the United States might soon meet demand for the COVID-19 vaccine, as I wrote about for the Deseret News.
The Surgo Ventures analysis suggested that the “the supply-demand shift for the vaccine will happen earlier than expected — as early as the end of April — and before the nation reaches the 70-90% threshold for achieving herd immunity.”
Axios reported that the United States would hit a “vaccine wall,” where there’s plenty of vaccines but little demand for it. This is why the “focus will abruptly shift to convincing holdouts to get vaccinated.”
- “This analysis shows that despite the general vaccine enthusiasm we are seeing now in the United States, things are going to get really difficult really soon,” said Sema Sgaier, Surgo’s CEO, according to Axios.",2021-04-23T16:39:12Z,2021,2,9

These vaccines were developed on his watch, with considerable support from his administration, in a time frame never before accomplished. Why not give Trump kudos for this accomplishment and move on to your own critical agenda?
For the Republicans, why not agree on a plan to set the 2020 election in the rear-view mirror? The party of Trump is in charge in Arizona and Georgia, so spend the next six to 12 months evaluating every potentially fraudulent vote and every potentially corruptible voting mechanism in those states, using teams of the best auditors, fraud investigators, information technology gurus, etc. If, in that process, you can find and prosecute the perpetrators of 10,000 or more fraudulent votes in each state, stick to your guns that the election may have been stolen.

Nearly 2.5 million people have been tested in Utah, utilizing more than 4.3 million tests, since the pandemic began in late 2019. The first cases of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Utah were identified in March of last year, with the first reported death in April.
To date, 2,159 people in Utah have died from COVID-19, the health department reports. There have been 390,104 COVID-19 cases identified in Utah, resulting in a 0.5% mortality rate in Utah.
The death toll across the United States, however, is much higher, with more than 31 million cases of COVID-19 identified and 561,000 deaths caused by the disease, resulting in a 1.8% mortality rate — meaning that 1.8% of people who contract the disease have died because of it, according to the Coronavirus Research Center at Johns Hopkins University.
The United States has experienced the highest concentration of COVID-19, surpassing disease counts anywhere in the world, while additionally experiencing the highest death toll, the center reports.
About 3.6% of COVID-19 tests administered in Utah are resulting in diagnoses of disease, the health department reports, with a rolling seven-day average number of positive tests now at 396 per day. The state reached as high as a 27% test positivity rate in December.
The state has administered 1,703,065 vaccines since they became available in December, including 19,328 since yesterday. That includes 1,099,828 people who have received at least one dose, and 679,331 people who are fully vaccinated.
The health department reported 43 people currently hospitalized because of COVID-19 in Utah on Sunday, though the low number is due to a reporting issue with one of the state’s health care systems. That number may be updated later in the day, according to the health department.
On Saturday there were 143 people hospitalized with COVID-19 in Utah, up from 129 a week ago.
In all, 1,570 people have been hospitalized in Utah since the pandemic began.
COVID-19 cases and deaths have been trending downward in Utah since the end of January, with peaks occurring in August and September of last year when schools and universities reopened to students, and then again around the winter holidays.
Highly populated areas throughout the state still have moderate to high transmission rates, with more rural counties exhibiting lower disease rates and lower incidence of transmission. Salt Lake and Utah counties have the most incidence of disease, but also the most people.
A new law passed by Utah lawmakers earlier this year ended the statewide mask mandate on Saturday, though masks are still required at schools and in groups of 50 or more. Businesses and local governments are able to enact mask mandates as they see fit, according to the law.",2021-04-11T19:37:54Z,2021,2,9
https://www.deseret.com/opinion/2021/4/4/22364150/covid-19-restrictions-prohibition-era-coronavirus-vaccine-passport/,Opinion: Continued COVID-19 restrictions could take us back to the Prohibition era,Deseret News,2021-04-05T04:00:00Z,"As the end of the pandemic is finally in sight, a lesson from America’s Prohibition era provides important insights about upcoming regulatory battles.
It’s a story of how bootleggers and Baptists worked together early in the 20th century to prevent the sale of alcohol on Sundays. The story was first told in 1983 by Bruce Yandle, a man with firsthand experience in the world of government relations. Among other roles, he served as executive director of the Federal Trade Commission.
Yandle noted that many regulations come about through an alliance of true believers and people who will make money because of that belief. In the early 20th century example, Baptists were true believers in the virtue of eliminating the sale of alcohol on Sundays (and in the larger cause of Prohibition). Bootleggers would naturally be seen as their enemy.
The bootleggers, on the other hand, loved what the Baptists were promoting. After all, if legal drinking was outlawed, there was a lot of money to be made by selling illegal spirits. As a result, even though the bootleggers might sneer at the alcohol fighting true believers, they were happy to fund their campaigns and activities.
For a politician, this dynamic created a golden opportunity. They could pretend to take the moral high ground by publicly supporting the true believers. But, behind the scenes, bootleggers found other ways to persuade those same politicians behind closed doors.
What does this have to do with the pandemic?
In 2021, there are many true believers who want strict health protocols imposed until the coronavirus is defeated. There is talk about requiring vaccine passports to attend public events. In New York, that approach has already been implemented. If you want to attend a wedding reception, you must have a vaccine passport to prove that you have been vaccinated. The only exception is if you get tested for COVID-19 a couple of days before the event and can prove you tested negative.
To true believers, such an approach is only common sense. For some, perhaps, it’s the only way they would feel safe going to public events again.
But for those selling tests, vaccines and masks, this is a great opportunity for profit. If everybody must be tested, vaccinated and wear masks, it’s an enormous windfall backed by government regulations. And, the bonus might never end if new vaccines are required to deal with variants or people are encouraged to wear masks even after the pandemic is over.
None of this is to suggest that the true believers are consciously acting to help these corporate benefactors of new regulations. And, to be clear, there is nothing wrong with companies earning a profit when they provide services that are already bringing the pandemic to an end. But, the combination has the potential to create regulations with long-running implications and costs.
Still, there’s another lesson in this story from the Prohibition era. The bootleggers and Baptists pushed through a constitutional amendment banning the sale of alcohol throughout the nation. The bootleggers made out like bandits and the Baptists thought they had won a significant victory. But it was short-lived. Preventing people from taking part in long-established social events with alcohol provoked a strong backlash. In just 13 years, another constitutional amendment brought Prohibition to an end.
Adding insult to injury for the bootleggers and Baptists, the entire Prohibition debacle resulted in a huge step backward for the unholy alliance. Prior to Prohibition, most U.S. counties banned the sale of alcohol. After Prohibition, it became legal everywhere.
A potentially similar dynamic exists today. A recent survey I conducted found that, within the past month, 66% of voters have taken part in social activities frowned upon by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This includes things like having dinner at an indoor restaurant, going out in public without a mask, attending church in person and large family gatherings.
If the policies dreamed of by true believers — policies like vaccine passports and never-ending lockdowns — become law, the United States could very well endure a wave of lawlessness much like that of the Prohibition era.

“Face coverings are required for all guests (ages 2 and up) and cast members, including those who have received a COVID-19 vaccine. Please bring your own face coverings and wear them at all times, except when dining or swimming. You may temporarily remove your face covering while actively eating, drinking or taking an outdoor photo, but you must be stationary and maintain appropriate physical distancing during this time.”
The new outdoor photo policy begins April 8.
Changes to face mask policy?
Disney World said back in February it would still require people who got the COVID-19 vaccine to wear masks, as I reported for the Deseret News.
- ”Face coverings are required for all guests (ages 2 and up) and cast members, including those who have received a COVID-19 vaccine.”
- “Please bring your own face coverings and wear them at all times, except when dining or swimming,” Disney said on its website.
Mask mandate in Orange County, Florida
Disney World is located in Orange County, Florida, which currently has a local mask mandate. However, Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings recently said the mask mandate could lift when the county’s population is vaccinated more than it is now, according to Florida Politics.
- “The mask mandate will end, I think, as we get closer to maybe 50% or better of our total population having been vaccinated,” Demings said.
- “Suffice to say, I believe that by the time we get to June perhaps we should be there, at that point. But we’ll see. And it’s contingent upon the spread of the virus within our community,” Demings added.",2021-04-08T16:30:00Z,2021,2,9

It’s unclear if the variant is resistant to vaccines or not.
What’s the Texas variant?
Texas A&M University researchers said they found a new variant — called the BV-1 variant or the Brazos Valley variant — in one saliva sample taken from a student at the school back in March. Researchers said they only found one example of the variant so far, according to NBC DFW.
- “We do not at present know the full significance of this variant, but it has a combination of mutations similar to other internationally notifiable variants of concern,” Global Health Research Complex chief virologist Ben Neuman said in a statement. “This variant combines genetic markers separately associated with rapid spread, severe disease and high resistance to neutralizing antibodies.”
- “We have not detected any more instances of this variant,” Neuman added. “We have not grown or tested this virus in any way. This announcement is based purely on the genetic sequence analysis done in the lab.”
Texas COVID-19 variant details
- According to the Texas A&M University scientists, the new variant “is related” to the variant originally discovered in the United Kingdom.
- The researchers said the infected student first tested positive on March 5. The student tested positive again on March 25. This may suggest “the variant may cause a longer-lasting infection than is typical of COVID-19 for adults ages 18-24,” according to the Texas A&M University. Most COVID-19 infections last about two weeks.
What’s next
Per NBC DFW, the university said the BV-1 variant is only one example of COVID-19 variants spreading throughout the world. The researchers said more needs to be done to understand variants.
- “Sequencing helps to provide an early warning system for new variants,” Neuman said, according to NBC DFW. “Though we may not yet understand the full significance of BV-1, the variant highlights an ongoing need for rigorous surveillance and genomic testing, including among young adults with no symptoms or only mild symptoms.”",2021-04-23T02:30:00Z,2021,2,9

COVID-19 cases in the Southeast Asian country of 33 million people have surged to record levels.
- New coronavirus cases reached record highs for four consecutive days, per Al Jazeera.
- Friday, Malaysia recorded a record 8,290 new COVID-19 cases, says The Associated Press.
On Friday, Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin announced a “total lockdown” nationwide from June 1 until June 14 due to the recent infections, reports Al Jazeera. During the lockdown, only essential services will continue to operate. All other social and economic activities must stop.
How bad are the coronavirus outbreaks in Malaysia?
While moderate by global standards, Malaysia's current surge of infections is the nation’s worst outbreak since the start of the pandemic, says Al Jazeera.
- Last year, the country recorded 113,000 coronavirus cases and 471 coronavirus deaths, says The New York Times.
- Now the country has recorded almost 550,000 cases — four times the number of last year’s cases — and 2,552 total deaths — five times the number of deaths last year — per The New York Times.
- Almost 40% of Malaysia's coronavirus-related deaths came from this month alone, says the AP.
Hospital and intensive care capacity is becoming increasingly limited as outbreaks strain the health care system. Malaysia has a record number of patients in intensive care and on ventilators, reports Al Jazeera.
Why the sudden surge in outbreaks?
Malaysia’s drastic rise of infections comes as a result of three recent challenges:
- The government mishandled the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, with the online registration system crashing, says The New York Times. Only 5% of the population has received their first dose, reports CNBC.
- A Muslim-majority nation, many Malaysians broke COVID-19 regulations for the Eid festival this month which celebrated the end of the holy month of Ramadan, says the AP. Eid celebrations have been linked to 24 coronavirus outbreak clusters of more than 850 cases.
- New, more contagious COVID-19 variants have also contributed to the recent outbreaks, says Al Jazeera.

- The reactions were specifically to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.
- Two people were taken to nearby hospitals and placed under review and observation.
- According to KDVR, the group of people who were not hospitalized were given juice and water for their recovery.
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said the side effects people at the Dick’s Sporting Goods Park site suffered included nausea and dizziness, according to The Denver Post.
- Both symptoms were expected, according to the department. However, the site was closed due to caution.
- “The state has no reason to believe that people who were vaccinated today at Dick’s Sporting Goods Park should be concerned,” the department said, The Denver Post reports.
Similarly, Kevin Massey, a spokesperson for Centura Health, which runs the site, told The Denver Post that 0.8% of the people vaccinated suffered from side effects, according to The Denver Post.
- Centra Health said in a statement (via Fox Business): “Following the administration of the J&J vaccine and during onsite observation, we saw a limited number of adverse reactions to the vaccine.

Fauci on Johnson & Johnson vaccine pause
Fauci spoke with Savannah Guthrie on the “Today” show about the pause of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration released a statement that charged for a pause of the vaccine after it found “a rare & severe type of blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine. Right now, these adverse events appear to be extremely rare.”
Fauci said the pause “could actually diminish vaccine hesitancy.”
- “The very fact that you have … the CDC and the FDA looking so carefully at this, making safety the primary concern, in my mind, confirms or underscores the situation that we take safety very seriously.”
Fauci told the “Today” show that the pause “is going to take days to weeks, as opposed to weeks to months.”
- “This is a rare occurrence. The pause is just an abundance of caution to scope out the situation a little bit more closely.”
Why is the pause happening?
The CDC and FDA paused the vaccine’s rollout after it found six women from 18 to 48 years old suffered blood clots after getting that specific vaccine, as I wrote for the Deseret News. The clots happened about 13 days after the vaccinations. The FDA said their findings were based on six cases reported out of 6.8 million total administered doses of the Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.
Fauci said Tuesday that the FDA and the CDC will use the pause to seek “any clues” to “find some common denominators among the women who were involved” who suffered the blood clots, CNBC reports.
- “We are totally aware that this is a rare event. We want to get this worked out as quickly as we possibly can and that’s why you see the world pause, in other words, you want to hold off for a bit,” Fauci said, as I wrote for the Deseret News. “We want to leave that up to the FDA and the CDC to investigate this carefully. I don’t think it was pulling the trigger too quickly.”",2021-04-15T00:45:00Z,2021,2,9

After a year of travel warnings ahead of major holidays, the CDC decided to tell fully vaccinated Americans to travel and enjoy time with their loved ones, according to The Washington Post.
- “Thanks to vaccines, tens of millions of Americans are able to get back to something closer to normal: visiting friends and family,” Walensky said, according to The Washington Post. “These are the events we missed over the last year, and we are now safe … when we are vaccinated.”
However, Walensky warned those who are not vaccinated from traveling, saying those people should take precautions to remain safe.
- “We are on a good downward path, but we are not quite out of the woods yet,” she said, according to The Washington Post. “Here’s to the start of blue skies and better days ahead.”
The Transportation Security Administration said Tuesday that 1.8 million people traveled last weekend, which was the highest number since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.

The photo — which was originally posted on Reddit — quickly went viral because it shows a Florida woman, dressed in yellow, kneeling on the floor and moaning in pain.
Louie Lopez took the photo when he went to the Jacksonville Main Library Conference Center Wednesday for a Regeneron therapy appointment, according to The Florida Times-Union.
Lopez, who is fully vaccinated, recently tested positive for COVID-19. But he has been experiencing symptoms, so his doctor recommended Regeneron therapy, which is an antibody cocktail that is meant to stop the coronavirus from being drug-resistant, according to the Dallas Morning News.
His wife, Suzanne Lopez, posted the photo on Reddit.
“Everyone please be careful - whether you are vaccinated or not. My husband (vaccinated, but positive) has been waiting 2+ hours for monoclonal therapy and he says he has never seen people so sick. Moaning, crying, unable to move,” she wrote about the photo.
Louie Lopez told The Florida Times-Union that the woman in the photo was likely lying on the ground for an hour. The staff tried to help her, but it seemed like “everything was new” to the staff workers.
Outrage erupted on social media about the photo. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been the target of much of the backlash, according to RawStory.
The city of Jacksonville has responded to the photo, too, saying the woman was waiting for the treatment to fight off her severe COVID-19, according to First Coast News.
“This treatment is meant to keep people OUT of the hospital and is designed for those early on in their COVID-19 diagnosis or for those who believe they have been exposed to COVID,” the city said. “Individuals with severe symptoms should contact a medical professional for guidance on the proper treatment for their situation.”",2021-08-20T18:30:00Z,2021,3,10

It’s still circulating throughout the country, infecting the fully vaccinated and the unvaccinated. So should we expect to see breakthrough cases?
How many breakthrough COVID-19 cases should there be?
Dr. Esther Choo, professor of emergency medicine at Oregon Health and Science University, said on Yahoo Finance Live that we should expect to see a high amount of breakthrough COVID-19 cases as the delta variant spreads. The vaccine isn’t 100% effective, after all.
- “There’s a lot of talk about how people are getting COVID anyway, even though they’re vaccinated, and that is true and that is expected because there’s no vaccine that’s 100% all the time,” Choo told Yahoo Finance Live.
But, Choo said, these cases aren’t leading to severe illness, which is helping people stay safe from the virus’ deadlier symptoms.
- “So we are seeing these breakthrough cases,” she said. “Many of them are asymptomatic, totally without symptoms, and they’re getting tested as part of contact tracing or other screening so that they can go on to certain activities or they have very mild symptoms.”
Are the COVID-19 vaccines still working?
Yes, as far as we know. The Wall Street Journal published a new analysis piece that looked at data from a new United Kingdom study that showed the coronavirus vaccines have, for the most part, stopped severe illness from the coronavirus amid the delta variant surge.
- “The vaccines are as good as first heralded, even against new variants,” The Wall Street Journal reported. “That unvaccinated people are still being hospitalized underscores the continuing need to get as many people vaccinated as possible.”
In Israel — one of the most vaccinated countries in the world — the vaccines have been working, as there was only one serious COVID-19 patient in the country who was fully vaccinated and under 60 years old, according to The Times of Israel. However, Israel's health experts are worried the vaccine’s effectiveness might be lower than what’s been reported so far.",2021-07-20T01:00:00Z,2021,3,10

Apparently, the media made her death up to make the whole thing seem more violent than it really was.”
I sat, dumbstruck, because I knew the “young Ashli woman” he was talking about was Ashli Babbitt. I’d read several things about her and knew that she had indeed forced her way into the Capitol that day along with hundreds of others and was attempting to get through barricaded doors in a hallway when an officer on the other side of those doors shot and killed her.
I’d seen the messages of grief her family members and friends had posted in the wake of the tragedy. On a “Good Morning America” appearance, I’d watched her grandfather honor some of the good she tried to do. I’d read multiple articles about her 12 years of service in the U.S. Air Force. I’d even seen a Washington Post video of the encounter showing the moment she was shot and killed. I knew Ashli Babbitt was a real person. I also knew that she was, in fact, dead.
Even still, I couldn’t bring myself to correct the misinformation this person was spreading to everyone around the table. All I managed to say in response was, “interesting ... .”
When I asked later about the source of his information, I was told he’d heard it on “a radio program.” And though I still don’t know which radio commentator he’d been listening to (and have since learned the “she’s still alive” rumor likely started among QAnon supporters), I know this much is certain: This person seemed to fully believe this falsehood.
And I must say this about him: Even though he believed an illogical thing in this scenario, he is not a stupid man. In fact, he’s one of the most learned people I know. He has served his community in many capacities. He’s had an incredible career. In many ways, he’s wiser than I’ll ever be, and I respect him considerably.
But in the months following this conversation, I’ve seen the positions he’s taken on other issues as well, and it’s become clear to me that he’s got a bug in his ear — someone feeding him a steady diet of spin and misinformation about political matters and even the COVID-19 pandemic.
He’s not unlike countless other friends or family members who have been indoctrinated against masks and vaccines in much the same way.
I’ve seen scores of people (who I similarly love and respect) share videos and posts on social media that grossly misrepresent information or are verifiably false. On many occasions, I’ve taken the time to track the source and have learned that, more often than not, it stems from the latest right-wing social media influencer rant gone viral.
I’ve observed that the one thing these friends and family members have in common is that they watch many of the same programs, listen to the same radio shows and follow the same political influencers on social media.
Just as Aaron Burr acknowledged the influence that Voltaire’s philosophies had on him before his duel with Alexander Hamilton more than 200 years ago, many people today are letting others influence their thinking in sometimes dangerous ways.
I won’t give oxygen to some of the most absurd claims I’ve seen, but I know what personalities like Tucker Carlson, Candace Owens, Robert Malone, Graham Allen and Clay Travis have had to say about vaccines and masks since this pandemic began, and I know how big their audiences are. My intention is not to make a blanket condemnation against any of these media figures. There are issues I’ve agreed with some of them on. But I would never (ever) take health advice from them, and I believe their followers should balance their views and avoid echo chambers at all costs.
I also know that misinformation is not just peddled by individuals anymore. A handful of news organizations do their viewers a disservice when reporting on important public health measures. Newsmax and One America News, for instance, have featured unsubstantiated or speculative information about masks and vaccines. Politifact, for example, has fact-checked a combined total of 53 of their claims and has found only three facts in the “mostly true” or “true” categories — with most of the others in the “false” or “pants on fire” categories.
Such messaging can have a devastating impact. A whopping 62% of Newsmax and OAN viewers have lost trust in public health officials according to a recent study by the Annenberg Public Policy Center. I’ve witnessed such an impact firsthand. Shortly after the 2020 presidential election, I saw one friend post on Instagram something to the effect of: “From now on, OAN is the only news source I’ll trust.” Unsurprisingly, she’s become one of the most vocal spreaders of misleading information I’ve seen on social media regarding election integrity, mask efficacy and vaccine safety.
It’s worth mentioning that, as NPR recently reported, even health care workers are not immune to vaccine misinformation. On that front, it’s best to follow the advice of one of the experts I recently quoted in a BuzzFeed News article: “You are better off if you follow the advice of the majority of health care professionals and the preponderance of evidence, not the advice of people with unique outlier opinions.”
When I see the lies that many people seem to believe, the words of Ronald Reagan come to mind: “(It’s) not that they’re ignorant; it’s just that they know so much that isn’t so.”
And since Reagan was talking about liberals when he made that statement, I’ll acknowledge that misinformation and extremism is not just a problem on the right. The left is certainly guilty of misinforming their audience as well. There’s a reason The Hill reported this summer that the “U.S. just finished dead last among 46 countries in media trust.”
Even on pandemic information and preventive measures, many left-wing media outlets initially got the messaging wrong, and influential celebrities such as Nicki Minaj still are today. And some on the left have lacked compassion or been nonsensical regarding extreme or unproven preventive measures. As Emma Green wrote in The Atlantic in May: Some liberals just can’t quit lockdown.
Furthermore, I know that people being led astray by misguided influencers is nothing new. Author Mimi Jacob’s advice is prescient on that front: “Be careful who you choose as your friends because their bad habits can become your bad habits.” But this is a particularly dangerous time to be playing Russian roulette with information.
Last week, U.S. News & World Report reported that 1 in 500 Americans have now died of COVID-19, a grim milestone that’s likely to get grimmer as hospitals run out of beds and supplies, and more people begin congregating indoors this fall and winter.
At this point in the pandemic, most scientifically-vetted preventive measures are not a matter of opinion. Choosing to let the wrong people “educate” you could be a fatal mistake. See, for example, the conservative radio talk-show hosts who have died of COVID-19 after speaking out against masks and vaccines to their audience of listeners.
Which brings me to my final point: As devastating as it’s been these past 18 months to see so many loved ones influenced by people whose primary motivation seems to be riling up their followers, I’ve been even more disheartened by how recklessly many of them turn around and spread the misinformation without seeming to question any of it.
In most cases, the information they’ve shared could have easily been debunked or significantly calibrated if the spreader was willing to spend only a few minutes fact-checking it before passing it along. Instead, dangerous misinformation is often callously and carelessly shared — making people believe that masks don’t work, that vaccines do more harm than good and that a dead woman is somehow alive.

Redfield said on Fox News Channel’s “The Story” that he thinks the coronavirus will continue to replicate quickly among humans, and so the risk of variant evolution is high.
“You know we dealt with the U.K. variant; everyone thought that was pretty bad, it was twice as infectious, but lo and behold three, four months later we had the delta variant and now it’s a dominant variant in the United States,” Redfield said.
He then predicted that there will be another, more dangerous coronavirus variant by the fall.
“Within, you know two, three, four months we’re going to have another variant and that variant’s going to be more infectious than the delta variant,” Redfield said.
Redfield said the coronavirus became one of the most infectious viruses in humans, which allowed it to mutate quicker.
Redfield’s comments come as other experts have warned about potential new variants that could come in the future. A vast number of scientists recently told Newsweek that there was potential of a variant that could not be stopped by the vaccines.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House medical adviser for the novel coronavirus, told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the unvaccinated population might be spreading the virus so much that there will be time for the virus to mutate.
“So, if you allow the virus to freely circulate and not try and stop it, sooner or later there is a likelihood that you will get another variant that could, I’m not saying it will, that could be more problematic than the delta,” Fauci said.
In fact, Fauci said that the virus may become so dangerous that they would have the power to evade vaccines, infecting thousands of people who, as of now, are safe from variants.
“If you give the virus the chance to continue to change, you’re leading to a vulnerability that we might get a worse variant,” he said. “And then, that will impact not only the unvaccinated; that will impact the vaccinated because that variant could evade the protection of the vaccine.”",2021-08-26T16:46:33Z,2021,3,10

But it’s not just COVID-19 that has a vaccine. There are vaccines for the flu, polio, measles and so much more.
A new report from WalletHub recently ranked each state in the country by how common vaccinations are in the individual state.

The top five states for vaccinations included:
- Massachusetts
- Vermont
- Rhode Island
- New Hampshire
- North Dakota
The bottom five states for vaccinations were:
- Mississippi
- Georgia
- Texas
- Arizona
- Nevada
Utah ranked in the bottom half of the report, finishing at No. 32 on the list. The Beehive State finished behind Arkansas, but ahead of Ohio in its rankings. The state was 22nd in the nation for vaccinating adults and 46th for vaccinating kids.

Do fully vaccinated people get hospitalized with COVID-19?
Right now, Israel has about 600 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. About half of those have been fully vaccinated with two doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, according to Reuters.
- For perspective, about 5.4 million people have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in Israel. So 300 out of 5.4 million is only about 0.0055%, per Reuters.
- Data from the CDC found that 99.999% of fully vaccinated people in the U.S. did not have a breakthrough COVID-19 case that led to hospitalization or death, as I wrote for the Deseret News.
Do fully vaccinated people get severe COVID-19 symptoms?
So who are these fully vaccinated patients who are being hospitalized? Here’s what Reuters found when speaking with 11 doctors in the country:
- They received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine five months ago.
- They are older than 60 years old.
- They have chronic illnesses, including diabetes, heart disease, lung ailments, cancer and inflammatory diseases.
These people are suffering from severe COVID-19 because of the continued spread of the delta variant and the waning efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine, as experts have suggested.
How the U.S. learns from Israel about COVID-19
The rise in breakthrough cases has been a sign that more people may need COVID-19 booster shots. In fact, United States health officials have looked to Israel’s data since the country “has been offering a coronavirus booster to people over 60 who were already vaccinated more than five months ago,” per The Associated Press. Though some people have suffered breakthrough cases, the booster shots are meant to protect older and more vulnerable people from the delta variant.

Is there monkeypox in Ohio?
The Ohio Department of Health is monitoring one resident who has been placed under quarantine after potential exposure to monkeypox on the recent flight to Texas, according to News 5 Cleveland.
“We are currently monitoring one individual in Ohio in quarantine after traveling on the same flight as the individual in Dallas diagnosed with monkeypox, although it is believed the risk of exposure is low,” the ODH said, per News 5 Cleveland.
Is there a monkeypox in Colorado?
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment told KDVR it is monitoring two people who had potential exposure to the monkeypox virus. Both people remain healthy and appear to have no symptoms of the virus.
Should you worry about the monkeypox virus?
Per the CDC, “There is no proven, safe treatment for monkeypox virus infection.”
- However, the U.S. has contained small outbreaks in the past, so health departments will continue to monitor cases. According to the CDC, health officials have stopped outbreaks using the smallpox vaccine, as well as some antiviral medication and the vaccinia immune globulin (VIG).",2021-07-29T14:00:00Z,2021,3,10

Where to expect high COVID-19 deaths
Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a CNN medical analyst, recently told CNN that there’s been an uptick on COVID-19 cases in specific hotspots across the country.
- He named Florida, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri and Nevada as states seeing the greatest surges right now.
The spread has come as the delta coronavirus variant has been spreading across the country.
- “In places like Missouri where ICUs are packed, you’re going to see a surprising amount of death,” he said, according to CNN.
- Deaths related to COVID-19 often come a few weeks after the case numbers spike. Reiner said the United States “will start to see an increase in mortality in this country.”
However, Reiner said the deaths don’t need to happen. Getting vaccinated can stop the spread.
- “The vaccines we have work really well against this variant. It doesn’t need to be this way,” Reiner said.
COVID-19 surges around the world
The hot spots in the United States aren’t the only surges we’re seeing, as fresh outbreaks have been spreading around the world, as the Deseret News reported.
- “With increasingly transmissible COVID-19 variants — including the delta and delta plus variants and the newer lambda variant — becoming more prevalent and faltering vaccination campaigns, many places around the world are experiencing renewed outbreaks,” according to the Deseret News.

https://www.deseret.com/2021/8/3/22606086/why-republicans-are-divided-over-californias-usual-recall-election-next-month-newsom-caitlyn-jenner/,A weird and wild recall election is about to take place in California,Deseret News,2021-08-04T04:00:00Z,"When Californians cast their ballots in the state’s recall election in September, the nation will be watching, because the nation is always watching California.
Forty-six candidates are vying to replace Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, including several well-known Republicans, Olympian and reality star Caitlyn Jenner, a YouTuber and a conservative radio talk show host. The race is an anomaly, not bound by the usual framework or timeline of a standard gubernatorial election, and a rarity, occurring only because of the pandemic.
“You can’t talk about the 2021 recall without the pandemic,” said Mark Baldassarre, president and CEO of the Public Policy Institute of California, or PPIC.
Newsom’s governing during the pandemic not only gave his opponents reasons run him out of office, but enabled them to force a recall.
Last November, a Sacramento County Superior Court judge ruled that recall organizers had an additional four months to gather signatures because of COVID-19 restrictions. The ruling “was huge because it would not have qualified without that extra time,” said Wesley Hussey, a professor at Sacramento State.
The ruling came just days after Newsom was spotted at a dinner at Napa County restaurant The French Laundry while the state was under restrictions. Newsom called it a “bad mistake,” and it energized his opponents.
Voters will be asked just two questions in the recall: Should Newsom be removed from office, and if he’s removed, who should replace him? Though California governors have faced recall threats before, the efforts don’t usually make it to the ballot. The Sept. 14 recall will be just the second in California history, following the 2003 recall won by Arnold Schwarzenegger.
The results of California’s 2021 recall won’t necessarily last very long, since the eventual winner will have to run for reelection next year. Still, Newsom is warning of potential consequences for “many, many years” if he loses.
“I think it would have profound consequences nationwide, and go to not just politics, but to policy and policymaking,” Newsom told the editorial boards of McClatchy’s California newspapers last Thursday.
Newsom said he doesn’t think national Democrats are worried enough about what it would mean if he lost, but he at least has the attention of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who filmed an ad for Newsom. In the clip, Warren asks viewers to vote no against the “Republican recall,” and accuses California Republicans of “abusing the recall process and costing taxpayers millions.”
Republicans have energy on their side. While they’re outnumbered in the state, a recent Los Angeles Times poll found Republicans were more likely to say they would vote than Democrats or independents. Hussey said Republicans are split on how the race could turn out for the party.
“The party has two kind of differing views,” he said. “The first is, the more Republicans who run, the better, because it might bring out different constituencies of Republicans who like different people, or maybe even independents.”
But not all Republicans in the state could be pleased with the top voting-getting candidate.
“The Republican Party doesn’t want to be in a position where the recall succeeds and the candidate who wins happens to be the most conservative, the most far-right, who has no chance to win in an election next year,” he said.
Voters will have a chance to size up some the candidates when they meet Wednesday for a debate at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum.
Here’s a look at the top candidates in California’s recall who have received at least 3% in polling released last week from the Los Angeles Times and UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies that surveyed 3,266 likely California voters. The poll has a sampling error of about +/-2 percentage points:
Gov. Gavin Newsom
Newsom took office after winning the 2018 gubernatorial race in a landslide, with 61.9% of the vote. A former lieutenant governor and San Francisco mayor, Newsom has received favorable marks as governor. A July 2021 PPIC poll found 59% of likely California voters approve of his handling of environmental issues and 56% approve of his handling of jobs and the economy. Still, the threat of recall is real.
Recent polls have found that a majority oppose the recall, while anywhere from 43%-47% say they want him out of office. As with all elections, it will come down to turnout, but off-year special elections can be especially unpredictable. The Los Angeles Times poll found nearly 90% of Republicans expressed a high level of interest in the recall compared with 58% of Democrats. While Republicans might be outnumbered in the state, if they’re more energized and show up in larger numbers, it could make all the difference.
Larry Elder
Elder, a conservative talk radio host, leads the field of Newsom contenders, with 18% support, per the Los Angeles Times poll. His “Larry Elder Show” is nationally syndicated, and he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2015.
In an interview with ABC7 News this weekend, Elder said he’s opposed to vaccine and mask mandates and that he believes in climate change but is “not sure” it’s played a role in California’s fires. In 2020, wildfires burned more acreage than any year on record, and the number of wildfires in the state is up from last year.
John Cox
Cox was the Republican candidate for governor in 2018 when he lost with 38% of the vote to Newsom. He’s also previously run and lost races for the U.S. House and Senate in Illinois in 2000 and 2002, respectively.
This time around, Cox is running a campaign heavy on gimmicks. He announced his latest candidacy with a live Kodiak bear, and to make a statement about government waste, he brought an 8-foot ball of trash as the backdrop for a campaign event last month. Cox told editorial boards of McClatchy’s California newspapers that the first issue he would address as governor would be housing costs. He received 10% in the recent poll.
Kevin Faulconer
Republican mayors of big cities are far and few between these days, but Faulconer was one of the few when he served as mayor of San Diego from 2014-2020. Faulconer pitched his path to victory as a road map for other Republicans who want to win in urban areas.
Faulconer has said as governor he would work to reduce homelessness and put the state on “war footing” to fight wildfires, and he polled at 10%.
Kevin Kiley
State Assemblyman Kiley targeted Newsom last year with a lawsuit accusing the governor of overstepping his authority. Though a court initially sided with Kiley, an appeals court overturned the ruling, according to CapRadio. Orrin Heatlie, a lead recall organizer, told CapRadio that Kiley had been with the recall effort “from day one, when we first started the recall, and he has done more than anybody else in the field to help push that needle forward.” Kiley is polling at 3%.
Kevin Paffrath
Paffrath is a YouTuber with 1.68 million subscribers on his “Meet Kevin” channel. He built an audience with videos about topics like cryptocurrency, investing and politics, and his new campaign videos are shot in the same direct-to-camera style as the rest of his content, with colorful thumbnails and titles to match, like a recent “i'm getting cancelled” video.
Paffrath is technically one of the few Democratic candidates in the race, but he’s also included clips from far-right broadcasting networks like OANN and Epoch Times in his videos. Paffrath sued the California secretary of state to get his YouTube name “Meet Kevin” included on the ballot, but a judge said, “The court finds that meet Kevin is not a nickname, it is not his formal name. The court finds, based on the evidence in front of it, that it is in fact a brand,” according to Fox26. He received 3% support in the recent poll.
Caitlyn Jenner
The 1976 Olympic decathlon gold medalist and reality TV star is the most famous candidate in the race, with 14.7 million followers across Twitter and Instagram, but that name recognition doesn’t seem to extend to the polls: Jenner received just 3% in the recent Los Angeles Times poll. Jenner had to skip the campaign trail last month to film “Big Brother VIP” in Australia, and she’s been spotted with a film crew at the Conservative Political Action Conference and an interview with Sean Hannity. “We’re documenting history,” a senior campaign adviser told Politico Playbook.",2021-08-04T04:00:00Z,2021,3,10
https://www.deseret.com/2021/9/22/22684875/conservatives-getting-beat-by-liberals-over-handling-of-pandemic-newsom-california-recall-elections/,Why liberals are winning elections on promises of tighter COVID-19 restrictions,Deseret News,2021-09-22T20:29:24Z,"From California to Canada, liberals are campaigning on the promise of fighting the pandemic with public health restrictions and criticizing their conservative opponents for opposing them, and so far, it’s working.
In his victory speech last week after defeating a recall, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said voters had sent a message.
“We said yes to science, we said yes to vaccines, we said yes to ending this pandemic,” Newsom said.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made similar remarks after his Liberal Party took the most seats following the election there Monday. During the campaign, Trudeau promised a more aggressive approach to fighting COVID-19 than Conservatives. “You are sending us back to work with a clear mandate to get Canada through this pandemic and to the brighter days ahead, and my friends, that’s exactly what we are ready to do,” he said.
The lesson for national Democrats is to lean in, according to Newsom. Several Democrats are already doing so, and at least one Republican is running as anti-mandate but pro-vaccine, showing how public health has shaped campaign messaging.
“We need to stiffen our spines and lean into keeping people safe and healthy, that we shouldn’t be timid in trying to protect people’s lives,” Newsom told CBS News after the election.
The pandemic fueled California’s recall, thanks to a court-approved extension for the time recall supporters had to gather signatures and Newsom attending an unmasked dinner party at the high-end Napa Valley restaurant The French Laundry, which turbocharged their efforts. But Democrats pitched Newsom as the most capable option to handle the pandemic, while characterizing Republican challenger Larry Elder, an opponent of vaccine and mask mandates, as anti-science.
Disagreements over mandates are playing out in other states with off-year gubernatorial elections this year. New Jersey’s incumbent Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy announced a vaccine mandate for day care facility workers this week, following similar mandates for schools and health care facilities, while his Republican opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, supports expanding vaccine exemptions.
In Virginia, Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe said during a debate last week that Republican Glenn Youngkin would “unleash COVID” as governor because he doesn’t support a mandate. A new ad from McAuliffe’s campaign even features a trauma critical care surgeon who says Youngkin would be “dangerous for Virginia.”
Youngkin is pushing back with a pro-vaccine message. His campaign released an ad in which he called on viewers to “join me in getting the vaccine,” and another in which a doctor says Youngkin believes vaccines save lives and encourages everyone to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Youngkin has even asked McAuliffe if he would join him to film a joint public service announcement promoting vaccinations, though no PSA has been filmed.
Recent polling from Pew Research Center shows why politicians are eager to show voters they take the pandemic seriously. A majority of American adults believe that while public health restrictions during the pandemic have hurt businesses and kept them from living their lives the way they want, 62% believe the public health benefits of restrictions have been worth the costs.
This week, the death toll from COVID-19 reached more than 675,000, surpassing that of the 1918 flu pandemic, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.",2021-09-22T20:29:24Z,2021,3,10

The trending Twitter hashtag #CovidisNotOver and fresh waves of outbreaks around the world have sent a strong message.
With increasingly transmissible COVID-19 variants — including the delta and delta plus variants and the newer lambda variant — becoming more prevalent and faltering vaccination campaigns, many places around the world are experiencing renewed outbreaks, reported the Deseret News.
Even previous pandemic success stories have begun to falter.
- Seoul announced stricter lockdowns Friday after recording two consecutive days of all-time high case numbers, reported the Deseret News.
- Australia has extended lockdowns as surges continue, reported CNN.
Currently, these are the top five worst outbreaks in the world.
5. Namibia’s outbreak
Last week, the Southern African country of Namibia recorded the highest average rate of infections in the world, reported The Telegraph. Almost half of Namibia’s total COVID-19 cases have come in the last two months.
- Namibia’s third — and deadliest — wave of outbreaks has been driven by the delta variant, per The Telegraph.
- The country has recorded more than 1,000 new coronavirus cases every day since June 15, per data from John Hopkins University.
Mohammed Patel, a local paramedic, spoke to CNN about the straining health care system.
“Delta has caused a whole lot of chaos, a whole lot of patients are suffering, their oxygen levels are dropping drastically daily — there are patients that are suffering and there is no space in hospital, there is no ventilators available,” Patel said. “It’s complete chaos.”
According to Dr. Yakub Essack, the medical coordinator of a charity called Gift of Givers, the situation in Namibia is unlike any emergency situation he’s ever dealt with.
- “The difference is when you go to a war zone or a natural disaster, you have an idea of the level of damage, what the disaster is,” he said per CNN. “But this is very unpredictable. We have never seen anything like this before.”
4. Thailand’s outbreak
In Thailand, coronavirus cases and deaths have more than doubled this week compared to last week, said Newsweek. Friday, the country reported more than 9,000 new cases and 72 new deaths, per Yahoo News. The health care system has begun to buckle under the increased demand.
- Since the start of the pandemic, Thailand has recorded 317,506 COVID-19 cases and 2,534 deaths, reported Newsweek.
- About 90% of Thailand’s cases and deaths have come since April — a tenfold increase, per Bloomberg.
The archipelago nation has now imposed a partial lockdown, but the restrictions are too little too late, said Newsweek. Cases are expected to continue rising.
3. Tunisia’s outbreaks
Over the last two weeks, COVID-19 cases in Tunisia have increased by 138% to hit all-time highs, according to Our World in Data. Friday, Tunisia reported 9,823 new cases and 134 new deaths Thursday, per WHO data.
- The North African country of 12 million people has a total caseload of more than 464,000 cases — and rapidly increasing, reported Al Jazeera.
“We are in a catastrophic situation,” Nisaf Ben Alaya, a Tunisia health ministry spokesperson, said, per Al Jazeera. “The health system collapsed.”
- “We are struggling to provide oxygen. … Doctors are suffering from unprecedented fatigue,” she said to Al Jazeera.
The country has reimposed a total lockdown across most of the country and a partial lockdown on the capital, according to Al Jazeera. So far, only 4% of the population has received a coronavirus vaccination.
2. Indonesia’s outbreak
By absolute numbers, Indonesia’s outbreak is large and deadly. Previously called a coronavirus “time bomb,” the world’s fourth most populous country is being devastated by the current surge in cases, reported the Deseret News.
- Wednesday, Indonesia recorded more than 34,000 new cases and 1,000 new deaths — a record high for the country, per The Guardian.
- Daily case numbers have continued to climb, reaching more than 38,100 cases on Thursday, per WHO data.
- Officials fear that daily cases could reach 70,000 before the peak of the current outbreak wave, said The Guardian.
Hospitals have begun running low on — or completely out of — necessary oxygen. Some hospitals have temporarily closed or turned patients away due to staff and supply shortages, said The Guardian. One hospital even began using the front yard to treat emergency patients while using the building to isolate COVID-19 patients.
- “This is not an easy situation. We are not fine,” health ministry spokeswoman Siti Nadia Tarmizi told The Guardian.
1. Brazil’s outbreak
Thursday, Brazil reported the highest number of new COVID-19 cases and new deaths in the world, per WHO data. The country currently has the second-highest death toll in the world after the U.S., but experts predict that fatalities in Brazil will soon surpass the U.S., said BBC.
- Brazil’s total caseload is nearing 19 million with the country recording more than 526,000 coronavirus-related deaths, according to WHO data.
- Thursday, Brazil reported 62,504 new cases and over 1,700 new deaths, per WHO data.
Professor Pedro Hallal, an epidemiologist leading the largest COVID-19 research study in Brazil, spoke to BBC about the outbreaks.
- “Everything that you should not do, Brazil has done,” he said
- Hallal, like many others, placed the blame primarily on Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.
- “In April last year, our president said it is coming to an end. Then he said the vaccines were not safe. These statements from the president himself produced damage, and they killed people,” Hallal said per BBC.",2021-07-11T02:00:00Z,2021,3,10

New calls for face masks
The World Health Organization has encouraged fully vaccinated people to start wearing masks again amid the coronavirus pandemic out of fears of the delta variant, which continues to surge in countries across the world.
- “People cannot feel safe just because they had the two doses. They still need to protect themselves,” said Dr. Mariangela Simao, WHO assistant director-general, according to USA Today.
The WHO isn't alone. For example, Los Angeles County called for residents to wear face masks in public spaces — no matter the vaccination status — to stop the spread of the delta variant.
What does Dr. Fauci think?
Dr. Fauci said it’s important to put the WHO’s guidance into perspective. The WHO deals with the entire world, whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Fauci and President Joe Biden issue calls for masks for the United States, Fauci said.
- “It is not comparable to look at what the WHO is recommending for the planet compared to what we in the United States, which have done generally quite well with vaccinations,” said Fauci, according to CBS News.
Fauci said the U.S. is a “well-vaccinated country.” But the entire world remains “under-vaccinated.” That said, Fauci said he’s concerned for the people who have not gotten their COVID-19 vaccination shots yet.
- “The delta variant has the capability of spreading much more efficiently from person to person. It also can cause more severe disease. So there are two things about it that are troublesome,” he said. “The good news about this is that the vaccines that are used in this country do very well against the delta variant.”
Will the CDC change its rules?
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is unlikely to change its guidances right now on face masks, Fauci told CBS News.
Indeed, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, said on the “Today” show that fully vaccinated people don’t need to worry about COVID-19 variants right now.
However, she said that “if you have an immunocompromising condition, if you might have had a transplant and you’re vaccinated, everybody should consider their own situation if they would feel more comfortable wearing a mask.”",2021-07-06T14:00:00Z,2021,3,10

Per WFAA-TV, the Texas Education Agency’s new guidance advised the following:
- Schools do not have to tell parents about a positive case of COVID-19.
- Schools do not have to conduct any contact tracing among children when someone tests positive for COVID-19.
- If schools do contract tracing for a positive case, parents can still send their child to school — even if they have close contact with an infected student.
Does the delta variant hurt children?
Experts have been warning recently that the delta variant is spreading to children. The variant can infect children and cause severe disease.
- That said, severe COVID-19 cases remain rare among children, Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a committee chairwoman with the American Academy of Pediatrics, recently told CNN.
Utah epidemiologist Dr. Leisha Nolen told the Utah State Board of Education in Salt Lake City that models show COVID-19 cases will spike in the fall among school-age children.
- “If we take and predict what we expect is going to happen, these modelers who use math can tell us that we should expect somewhere between an even number where we are right now to even four times as much. So we expect by October these numbers to possibly go up quite significantly. So we think there will be quite a few cases in the K through 12 age group,” Nolen said.
What does the CDC suggest for children?
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommendations for keeping children safe from the novel coronavirus, especially when they’re in school. The list of advice continues:
- Eligible children should get the COVID-19 vaccine.
- There should be universal masking in schools.
- Children should keep 3 feet of distance between each other.
- Schools should tout hand-washing and disinfecting of surfaces.
- Schools should embrace contact tracing if there is a positive case.
- Infected children should stay home if they’re sick.
- Children should stay home from school if they have been infected or have been in close contact with someone who was infected.

Does Delta Air Lines require vaccines for employees?
Per CNBC, Delta Air Lines said it would increase premiums by $200 per month to cover COVID-19 costs. The policy will begin on Nov. 1.
- This is similar to a company raising health insurance premiums for smokers, which is a common occurrence in modern America.
Beginning on Sept. 12, unvaccinated Delta employees will need to take a COVID-19 test every week, especially as COVID-19 cases surge amid the delta variant’s spread, according to CNBC.
- “The average hospital stay for COVID-19 has cost Delta $40,000 per person,” Bastian said in a memo to employees, per CNBC. “This surcharge will be necessary to address the financial risk the decision to not vaccinate is creating for our company. In recent weeks since the rise of the B.1.617.2 variant, all Delta employees who have been hospitalized with COVID were not fully vaccinated.”
What airlines require vaccines?
Other airlines, like United Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines, have decided to mandate COVID-19 vaccination for employees.
- However, Southwest Airlines, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines have been adamant that they will not require vaccinations for employees, as I wrote for the Deseret News.
Do you need to be vaccinated to travel?
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said people should be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 before they visit other countries. International travelers often need to be vaccinated before visiting other countries, too.
- “Fully vaccinated travelers are less likely to get and spread COVID-19. However, international travel poses additional risks, and even fully vaccinated travelers might be at increased risk for getting and possibly spreading some COVID-19 variants,” the CDC said.",2021-08-25T16:50:00Z,2021,3,10

Sign up to receive the newsletter in your inbox each Tuesday night.
Kalani Sitake made a shift from fall camp to game preparation this week by fine-tuning his depth chart, creating a scout team and posting a travel roster for the trip to Las Vegas for the opening game against Arizona of the Pac 12.
To do this, he needed to get some of the starters more reps in practices, especially 11 on 11s. In Saturday’s scrimmage, he limited tackling of running backs and the QBs are off-limits. It’s a fine line coaches play in trying to protect the health of players while pumping the gas on aggression and physical play.
On Saturday, Fesi Sitake put Washington transfer Puka Nacua on the field with increased reps and he delivered some nice catches. BYU’s defense fiddled with its increased emphasis on putting pressure on opposing QBs early in the scrimmage, and it was effective on Aaron Roderick’s offense.
Cougar Insider’s predictions
Question of the week: Now that we know Jaren Hall will start at quarterback against Arizona, what kind of season will he have? Predict his strengths and weaknesses, assuming he can stay healthy for the entire year.
Jay Drew: Jaren Hall should have an above-average season for the Cougars in 2021. Asking him to put together the type of season Zach Wilson did last year is a big stretch, though, given the quality of opponents that Hall will face.
The last time we saw Hall — the first half against Utah State in 2019 — he was sensational. Concussions robbed him of showing more of what he could do that year. So now is his time, and I expect him to shine because he’s got a big arm, outstanding running ability and good leadership skills. His teammates seem to like him and will rally behind him.
He’s also got strong coaching in his corner — Aaron Roderick proved that last year with his work with Wilson — and a nice supporting cast on offense.
Dick Harmon: Aaron Roderick has been looking for consistency and big playmaking ability and Jaren fits that bill. He will need to increase his accuracy to be effective in this offense. People should be a little careful with expectations of any replacement for Zach Wilson — he was that good. He was generational good. Hall still has not played a lot of college football due to his string of concussions, but he deserves the chance and BYU is giving him that.
Hall is a gamer and a tremendous athlete. He can extend plays and when he breaks for a run, like Taysom Hill, he can go the distance, not just pick up a first down. He will be very good on bootlegs and sprint outs throwing on the run. He has good chemistry with the receivers and tight ends and is a leader. He has fulfilled his slot as a legacy recruit, son of Kalin Hall, a former running back.
Cougar tales
BYU golfer Kerstin Fotu became the first woman to make the cut in the Utah Open, which was held at Riverside Country Club this past weekend. The long-hitting Cougar was required to play from the tips with professionals from all over the country including former Dallas Cowboy quarterback Tony Romo.
Zach Wilson had a great week of hype and praise after his performance against the Green Bay Packers. He also received great praise from Romo when I asked the NFL TV analyst what he thought about Wilson’s talent.

Comments from Deseret News readers
I’m increasingly more excited about this game and will be driving to Las Vegas that morning (like many, I jumped to get the tickets right away). (I expect that I-15 will have a lot of fellow travelers heading to this game on that day.)
Just read that masks will be required inside Allegiant Stadium — I’m happy to hear it.
Also read that Arizona’s football team is 100% vaccinated against COVID — they should be praised for this.
(I would like to know where we stand in this regard. Whittingham said on Saturday that the Utes likely will stay at about 95% with around 6 players still opting out.)
In a rather unique fashion, Allegiant Stadium allows play on both artificial turf (which UNLV uses for its home games) and natural grass turf (which the Raiders use for their home games). The natural turf is on a gigantic “tray” that is kept outside most of the time and moved into the stadium for the Raiders games. Does anyone know which will be used for our game with Arizona? (I would guess the artificial turf but would be interested to have this confirmed or refuted.)

https://www.deseret.com/coronavirus/2021/8/23/22637786/pfizer-covid-vaccine-new-name-comirnaty-pronounce/,The FDA reveals the new name for the Pfizer COVID vaccine,Deseret News,2021-08-23T18:00:00Z,"It’s official — the Food and Drug Administration has given its full approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, a major move in the coronavirus pandemic.
- And, it looks like the Pfizer vaccine has a new name.
What’s the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine's new name?
According to the FDA, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine will be marketed as Comirnaty — pronounced “koe-mir’-na-tee.”
- The vaccine will be marketed as a vaccine to protect against COVID-19 disease for those 16 years old and up.
- Anyone from 12 to 15 years old can get the vaccine under emergency use approval, but it has not been fully approved for those age groups.
What to know about Comirnaty
Per the FDA, Comirnaty contains mRNA genetic material, which “is used by the body to make a mimic of one of the proteins in the virus that causes COVID-19.”
- “The result of a person receiving this vaccine is that their immune system will ultimately react defensively to the virus that causes COVID-19,” according to the FDA.
- And the mRNA from Comirnaty “is only present in the body for a short time and is not incorporated into — nor does it alter — an individual’s genetic material,” per the FDA.
- Overall, Comirnaty has the same makeup as the vaccine approved for emergency authorization, and it is given out in two doses, per the FDA.

They’re becoming more and more likely among the fully vaccinated community, and experts expect them to be even more common in the near future.
Experts recently told Roll Call, a data-driven political news site, that the breakthrough COVID-19 cases will impact thousands of people. And most people, they said, will become infected with COVID-19 at some point in their lives.
- “It’s likely that everybody will probably get infected with COVID-19 (at some point) because it’s an endemic respiratory virus. The goal is to make sure that at that time, that infection occurs after you’ve been vaccinated so it’s mild,” Amesh Adalja, a doctor and infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told Roll Call.
The best way to protect yourself from severe disease, though, comes in the form of the COVID-19 vaccine. Carlos del Rio, a professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at Emory University School of Medicine, told Roll Call the vaccines are significantly important to stopping death and hospitalization from the coronavirus.
- “If I’m in a little bit of rain and I have an umbrella, I don’t get wet. But if I’m in a hurricane, I’m going to get wet despite wearing an umbrella. That doesn’t mean you can say, all of a sudden, umbrellas don’t work very well. It’s a hurricane,” he said.
That doesn’t mean breakthrough cases of COVID-19 are a walk in the park. Will Stone, of NPR, recently had a breakthrough case. He said his arms and legs were aching and he had a fever that “crept up to 103 and every few hours of sleep would leave my sheets drenched in sweat.”
- “To sum it up, I’d put my breakthrough case of COVID-19 right up there with my worst bouts of flu. Even after my fever cleared up, I spent the next few weeks feeling low,” he said.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released data from a new study that found unvaccinated people are five times more likely to be infected by the coronavirus and 10 times more likely to be hospitalized from the virus.
Meanwhile, unvaccinated people had a more than 10 times higher chance of dying from COVID-19, according to the CDC.",2021-09-26T14:00:00Z,2021,3,10

When will COVID-19 end?
Fauci told CNN on Monday that the U.S. could put the pandemic away if a majority of people get vaccinated by early 2022.
- “We hope we’ll be there ... but there’s no guarantee because it’s up to us,” Fauci said.
On Tuesday, Fauci told the “Today” show that vaccination will be key to stopping the pandemic.
- “If we do it right and get through the winter, I hope as we get to the spring of 2022, we’ll get there,” he said on the “Today” show.
What vaccine approval means for the end of COVID-19
Fauci made these comments after the Food and Drug Administration gave full approval for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for those 16 years old and up. The vaccine is still approved for emergency use for children 12 to 15 years old. Anyone under 12 does not have the approval to get the COVID-19 vaccine yet.
- Fauci told the “Today” show that children under 12 might have approval for vaccination by “mid late fall, early winter.”
Fauci said on the “Today” show that the approval is a good sign for the direction of the pandemic.
- “We can see light at the end of the tunnel where … you see a dramatic diminution, not only in cases, but in hospitalizations and ultimately, of course, in deaths,” he said.
- Fauci told the “Today” show that “there will now be much more enthusiasm in mandating vaccines” which he believes “will contribute greatly to the number of people vaccinated.”",2021-08-25T01:00:00Z,2021,3,10

Math models suggest COVID-19 cases could quadruple from current levels by fall, she said.
COVID-19 cases among school-age children are rising along with the general population, largely due to the spread of the more-contagious delta variant of the virus. On Thursday, state health officials reported 1,096 new cases from a day earlier, and a rolling seven-day average for positive tests of 905 per day.
“If we take and predict what we expect is going to happen, these modelers who use math can tell us that we should expect somewhere between an even number where we are right now to even four times as much. So we expect by October these numbers to possibly go up quite significantly. So we think there will be quite a few cases in the K through 12 age group,” Nolen said.
Utah health authorities recommend wearing masks in schools, but it is not required under state law — except on school buses under federal directives.
The best protection for children is vaccination, she said. Vaccinations have not yet been approved for children under the age of 12.
“The best thing to do is get vaccinated. Second best is to wear a mask. ... If you want to protect your kid, this is the best way to do it,” she said.
Presently, 40% of Utah’s school-age youth have received one dose of coronavirus vaccine, although those numbers may rise as concerns about the delta variant increase, Nolen said.
Many people perceive COVID-19 mostly affects older adults, “the truth is, it also can have significant impacts on children,” Nolen said.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, 82,273 children from newborn to age 18 have been diagnosed with COVID-19.
Among them, 752 were hospitalized with 46 requiring intensive care unit stays. Eighty-two Utah children developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome, “where it affects really many organ systems and causes really significant disease,” Nolen said.
Within Utah’s population ages 0-18, children in the K-12 group represented 92% of COVID-19 cases, 81% of hospitalizations, 78% of intensive care unit admissions and 67% of the multisystem inflammatory syndrome cases, according to data presented to the board.
“So these kids are being affected. There’s no question,” she said.
Nolen said health and education officials have a shared interest in keeping students healthy and attending school as much as possible.
Health authorities have the added concern of patient loads in hospitals during the recent surge of COVID-19 cases.
“Our health care system already is almost at the breaking point. If we put kids back in school and we then add to all these cases exponentially, our health care systems are not going to be able to treat our sick patients. I could imagine that might start the conversation of when do we put in directives,” Nolen said.
Last week, the Utah Department of Health issued its latest COVID-19 guidelines for schools, which recommended vaccination of all people age 12 and older and wearing masks indoors at schools.
The recommendations also include:
- Isolating at home if you test positive for COVID-19.
- Quarantine and other protective measures after a school exposure.
- Testing for COVID-19.
- Staying home when you’re sick.
- Physical distancing and grouping students and staff into cohorts.
- Improving or increasing indoor ventilation.
- Hygiene practices.
- Cleaning and disinfection.",2021-08-05T22:24:36Z,2021,3,10

- In a release, the companies said “the vaccine was safe, well tolerated and showed robust neutralizing antibody responses” for children 5 to 11 years old, who do not currently have a COVID-19 vaccine to keep them safe from the virus.
- The dose given to these children is about one-third the amount given to adults.
The companies said they will submit data on their findings to the Food and Drug Administration. The companies hope that the vaccine will be sent to the FDA by the end of September.
- “Then, the data — not yet published or peer-reviewed — will be scrutinized by regulators to ascertain that the vaccine is safe and effective. That could take weeks, or up to a month,” according to The Washington Post.
This is about on pace with what experts expected to happen with a vaccine for children under 12. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said last week that the COVID-19 vaccine for children under 12 years old would likely be available by the end of 2021.
- “We want to move quickly, we anticipate moving quickly, but we also want to have the efficacy data and the safety data that the (Food and Drug Administration) will require ... to make sure that it is the right thing for kids,” she said.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former FDA commissioner, said on ”Face the Nation,” said Pfizer expects the vaccine could be released by Halloween in a best case scenario.
- “In a best-case scenario, given that timeline they’ve just laid out, you could potentially have a vaccine available to children aged 5 to 11 by Halloween,” Gottlieb said. “If everything goes well, the Pfizer data package is in order, and FDA ultimately makes a positive determination, I have confidence in Pfizer in terms of the data that they’ve collected. But this is really up to the Food and Drug Administration to make an objective determination.”",2021-09-20T16:20:00Z,2021,3,10

New countries on the CDC travel risk list
The CDC recently added six new countries to its “Level 4: Covid-19 Very High” risk list, which is a collection of countries that have a high number of COVID-19 cases.
- According to CNN, a country will likely make this list if there have been more than 500 cases per 100,000 residents in that country.
The newest countries to join the list include:
- Bahamas
- Haiti
- Kosovo
- Lebanon
- Morocco
- Sint Maarten
These new countries were added about one week after the CDC added four countries to its list, according to my report for the Deseret News.
CDC adds 4 more countries to risk list
Earlier in August, the CDC added four destinations to its “Level 4: COVID-19 Very High” risk list, per CNN.
- Dominica
- Jersey
- Montenegro
- Turkey
CDC adds 16 countries to list of risky countries
CDC added 16 separate destinations to its list. The CDC recommends avoiding these locations for traveling.
- “Fully vaccinated travelers are less likely to get and spread COVID-19. However, international travel poses additional risks, and even fully vaccinated travelers might be at increased risk for getting and possibly spreading some COVID-19 variants,” the CDC said.

- Greece
- Guadeloupe
- Iran
- Ireland
- Isle of Man
- Kazakhstan
- Lesotho
- Libya
- Malta
- Martinique

Is there a lambda variant in the U.S.?
Per USA Today, a Houston hospital said it has found its first case of the lambda variant of the coronavirus. However, experts remain unsure if the single case could lead to a widespread outbreak in the same way the delta variant has been raging throughout the country, according to USA Today.
- So far, there have been less than 700 cases of the lambda coronavirus variant in the U.S., according to the USA Today
What is the lambda variant?
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the lambda variant was first detected in Peru in summer 2020.
- The lambda variant is currently listed as a “variant of interest” on the World Health Organization list of variants.
- According to the World Health Organization, the lambda variant has some mutations that might make it resistant to antibodies that are created from vaccines.
What are lambda variant symptoms?
Science Focus recently reported on the symptoms of the lambda variant, which has been spreading to the United Kingdom. The symptoms are not all that different than the normal strain of the virus. Here’s a breakdown of the symptoms.
- High temperature.
- A continuous cough.
- A loss of change in smell or taste.
Is the lambda variant contagious?
Dr. S. Wesley Long, medical director of diagnostic biology at Houston Methodist, told USA Today that the lambda variant might not be as transmissible as the delta variant.
- “I know there’s great interest in lambda, but I think people really need to be focused on delta,” Long said. “Most importantly, regardless of the variant, our best defense against all these variants is vaccination.",2021-07-22T16:28:46Z,2021,3,10

Experts suggest fully vaccinated people may want to wear face masks again, especially if there’s a surge in cases in your area.
Should you wear a mask again?
Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recently told NBC News that the COVID-19 vaccine offers a high amount of protection.
- “If you’re vaccinated, you have a very high degree of protection from all of the variants that we are aware of circulating in the United States,” she said.
However, Walensky told NBC News people may want to mask up in areas where there’s a low vaccination rate, and where there’s an uptick in cases.
- “If you’re in a community that has a high amount of disease and less than a third of your population is vaccinated, one should consider whether the policy should be to mask,” Walensky said.
- She said wearing a mask is “more about protecting the two-thirds of the community that are not vaccinated.”
New variants could rise
Dr. Ashish Jha, the dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, recently told CNN that areas with low vaccination rates and rising COVID-19 case numbers could become “breeding grounds” for COVID-19 variants, too.
- “We’re already starting to see places with low vaccination rates starting to have relatively big spikes from the delta variant. We’ve seen this in Arkansas, Missouri, Wyoming ... those are the places where we’re going to see more hospitalizations and deaths as well, unfortunately,” he said.
- “And any time you have large outbreaks, it does become a breeding ground for potentially more variants.”

To be present, choir members were required to be vaccinated, screened, tested for COVID-19 on-site, sit apart from one another and wear a face mask.
Still they rejoiced at the opportunity to be together again. Less than 20 minutes into the rehearsal, the triumphant sound of “Come, Ye Children of the Lord” filled the almost empty Conference Center and signaled the choir had returned.
“I’m overjoyed,” said James Sutherland, a choir member and committee member who helped organize the choir’s safe return to singing. “It’s been a long 18 months apart. I think every person in this organization is just so very much looking forward to being back together.”
How the Tabernacle Choir’s return relates to Swiss cheese
The Tabernacle Choir, goodwill ambassadors for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, halted all live events in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then the organization has not rehearsed, performed or recorded music.
The choir announced plans to return to rehearsals and performances in July.
One month after becoming the choir’s new president, former Utah Gov. Michael O. Leavitt introduced a seven-step plan at an organization-wide “Restart Orientation” via Zoom on Thursday, Sept. 9, according to the Tabernacle Choir blog.
Leavitt likened the plan to resume choir activity to the image of stacking slices of Swiss cheese. Each slice has holes, but the more layers of protection applied, the higher the likelihood that the COVID-19 virus spread can be minimized, said Leavitt, who previously served as the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services.
The multilevel plan will allow the choir to sing at the October 2021 general conference. Half the choir will sing in the Saturday morning session, and the other half in the Sunday morning and Sunday afternoon sessions.
The choir’s multilevel strategy includes these seven layers:
1. Vaccinations: All performers must be vaccinated and provide evidence of being immunized. (Those not vaccinated will be granted a special leave until conditions improve.)
2. Screening: Those with health conditions that limit effectiveness of their immune systems even if vaccinated or those with immunocompromised household members will also be granted special leave.
3. Testing: Every performer and all support personnel will be tested prior to each rehearsal or performance.
4. Social distancing: For general conference, only half of the choir will sing at each session.
5. Face coverings: Masks will be worn except when actively rehearsing or performing.
6. Self-reporting: Organization members will report COVID-19 symptoms or household exposure and stay home with any symptoms, even sniffles.
7. Ventilation: Performances will be limited to the Conference Center for now because of greater ventilation safety.
Leavitt is confident the plan will work. Preparation included consultation with many medical professionals and public health professionals, he said.
“We’ve constructed a plan that we believe will keep the virus out of the loft where the choir sings. We will be following and testing every time we meet. I think this is a good example of how you can assure safety under difficult conditions,” Leavitt said. “I continue to feel more and more optimism and excitement for the choir, and for them to sing tonight to demonstrate that we can both be precautious and safe, and have the choir sing.”
A small number of choir members have requested special leave of the choir, which means taking leave of the choir without any repercussions to their attendance, said Dr. David Palmer, the choir’s medical doctor.
Along with being a choir member, Sutherland is a professor of chemical engineering at the University of Utah who has done airflow dynamic studies in venues like Abravanel Hall, the Capitol Theatre and other venues around the country.
“The No. 1 priority, the overarching goal, was to create a safe environment for the choir to rehearse and perform,” Sutherland said. “We knew that if we couldn’t do that, we weren’t coming back.”
What happened at the first rehearsal?
In keeping with tradition, choir rehearsal opened with a prayer. The choir member giving the prayer expressed gratitude for the chance to gather again, for health and strength, assistance in preparing to perform at general conference, and that their “voices would return to us.”
Leavitt and Bishop Gerald Caussé then addressed the choir.
“In 174 years that the choir has existed, there’s never been a time when there was this type of break in rehearsal and performance — 555 days since this marvelous sound has echoed through the chambers of the Conference Center in the (Salt Lake) Tabernacle,” Leavitt said. “Tonight we have engaged in a minor sacrifice for the privilege of being able to be together and to testify in song of the Savior and his love. I have every confidence that we’ll continue, that the choir will move forward, that 555 days is enough.”
Seeing the choir back in the Conference Center gave Bishop Caussé “goose bumps.”
“I was having goose bumps when I came into the Conference Center and I’m still having them just to see you here and to realize this is the first time in many months,” the church leader said.
Bishop Caussé invited the choir to pray that they might continue uninterrupted through general conference and Christmas.
“I know that the Lord has this choir under his protection,” he said.
How it feels to be back with the Tabernacle Choir
As choir members arrived, they reported to tables organized in alphabetical order along the plaza level of the Conference Center for a COVID-19 rapid test. Once cleared, they received a green sticker and walked to the choir loft.
For choir member Staci Dame, the screening and testing process felt “familiar and comfortable.”
“We’re all a little bit excited. People are smiling everywhere. We’re here earlier than normal. People are just anxious to be back in the saddle,” she said. “I feel very safe knowing that they’ve taken so many precautions, so many layers ... to keep us protected.”
Anthony Kirkham, who sings in the baritone section, loved the feeling of getting together with old friends again.
“It feels really fantastic,”Kirkham said. “After being gone for so long, I look forward to filling the void that I felt for the last 18 months. There’s something about being with your friends and with really good musicians, and something about singing high quality music at a high level that creates a feeling that you can’t duplicate. That’s the feeling that I’ve been missing a lot. That’s the part I look forward to the most.”",2021-09-22T04:27:20Z,2021,3,10

Get vaccinated,Deseret News,2021-07-29T20:07:04Z,"Conservatives like me groaned on Tuesday when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reversed course and suggested fully vaccinated people should wear masks in certain indoor settings, including areas with “high transmission” rates of the virus.
A week and a half earlier, Los Angeles County reinstated an indoor mask mandate for public spaces, regardless of vaccination status. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is reportedly mulling whether to implement the CDC’s guidance throughout the city.
All this is a haymaker for Republicans who, after more than a year of slogging through onerous restrictions and watching liberal leaders clamp down unnecessarily hard on religious worship, will find a new wave of Democratic control repulsive.
But, there’s a way to strike back: Get vaccinated.
The shots reduce the spread of the virus and, more importantly, are highly effective in guarding against death. When enough people are inoculated, the virus peters out, which would strip any public health mandate of its usefulness, forcing liberal policymakers to concede.
If nothing else, those conservatives who want to “own the libs” have a clear way to thwart the proposals of Democrats in power.
They also have a chance to needle, pun intended, Donald Trump’s detractors. President Joe Biden would love to claim credit for a successful vaccination program, but he shouldn’t forget the drugs were developed under the watch of his predecessor. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said as much while on the campaign trail in Arkansas earlier this week:
“Condescending politicians and bureaucrats,” she said, “misjudged the Trump vaccine plan, which rolled out just as safely, quickly, and effectively as the Trump administration promised.”
Trump, too, received the vaccine. “I would recommend it, and I would recommend it to a lot of people that don’t want to get it, and a lot of those people voted for me, frankly,” he said on Fox News.
Following the lead of Sanders and Trump by receiving the shot would vindicate the efforts of their administration and take the wind out of the sails of Democrats who use low vaccination rates as a chance to pounce on Republicans.
Democrats are responding to a very real threat. Case counts of COVID-19 are surging, and as public health officials have put it, this is now a “pandemic of the unvaccinated.” But their policy decisions have hardly been narrowly tailored or even in many circumstances successful.
What has worked? The vaccine.
Of the 130 people in Maryland who died from COVID-19 in the month of June, not a single one was vaccinated, according to reports. In the month before, 99.2% of all COVID-19 deaths in the country were among the unvaccinated, an analysis shows.
The numbers overwhelmingly indicate the vaccination programs are effective. Even with so-called “breakthrough” cases among the inoculated population, vaccines have proven to dramatically reduce the likelihood of severe symptoms or death.
In the end, Democratic institutions are trying to do the right thing, only they’re doing it in a way that makes conservatives queasy. Calling them out is just a jab or two away.

By the year 2100, people could be living to age 150 or more.
Well ... it doesn’t look good, so far, does it?
I had a lot of reasons for optimism back then. At the start of the 20th century, life expectancy in the United States was 47 years. By 2000, it had reached 76.9 years. With all the advancements underway in medicine, and with genetic scientists working hard on unlocking ways to increase longevity, why shouldn’t we have expected an even larger increase over the next 100 years?
I wasn’t completely out on a limb. Some experts back then were predicting 150 to 200 year lifespans.
If we’re going to make it, we had better shift course.
The frustrating news this week from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was that the United States, already ranked a dismal 46th in the world in terms of life expectancy (according to worldometers.info), took a big step backward. It fell by a year and a half overall in 2020. For Black and Hispanic Americans, the news was considerably worse. Their projected lifespans fell by three years.
An American born in 2020 is expected to live until 77 years, 4 months. That’s still a teeny bit longer than a kid born in 2000, but it’s less than someone born in 2019.
You don’t have to be a scientist to figure out the reason. COVID-19 led the way to the 3.3 million overall deaths in 2020, which was a record. The pandemic accounted for about 11% of them. All told, health officials said the coronavirus is to blame for about 74% of the decrease in life expectancy.
This is, of course, a temporary blip on the 21st century. More than 100 years ago, the double whammy of World War I and the Spanish Influenza pandemic brought the male life expectancy from 52.5 years in 1915 to 36.6 in 1918. But the nation made up the difference fairly quickly.
Today, I’m wondering if we have what it takes to bounce back as fast.
Unlike 100 years ago, we have a way to prevent further infections by today’s pandemic. And yet, new COVID-19 cases are on the rise everywhere. In Utah on Wednesday, the daily increase was 873, with four more deaths. Officials say 85% of those were made sick by the new delta variant of the virus, something any of several vaccinations protect against in most cases.
And yet, the CDC reports only 48.4% of Americans have become fully vaccinated. In Utah, the estimate is 44%.
Vaccines are safe, free and effective, yet the number of daily doses administered has slowed to a trickle. Meanwhile, in Utah and many other places, political leaders are in no mood to reimpose mask mandates or to once again close sporting events or public venues.
So, other than some sternly worded official declarations urging people to get vaccinated, we do nothing — nothing, that is, except hope this collective carelessness doesn’t allow the virus, free to infect so many hosts, to mutate into something the vaccines can’t prevent.
The scientists I alluded to 20 years ago still are at work. One recent study concluded that, absent a serious disease or accident, the natural aging process gives the human body an outer limit of about 120 to 150 years of life.
But that isn’t going to be the last word. Peter Fedichev, a co-author of the study, told Scientific American, “Measuring something is the first step before producing an intervention.”
That kind of optimism has me thinking the nation might recover from its current stumbles and get back on the road to longer and longer lives. But that won’t happen if people insist on valuing short-term pleasure over long-term gains, and if they continue to ignore simple preventative measures in the face of a serious threat.",2021-07-21T22:13:34Z,2021,3,10

Should you travel over Labor Day weekend?
Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the CDC, said Thursday at a White House press briefing that unvaccinated people should be cautious about making any trips this weekend.
- “First and foremost, if you are unvaccinated, we would recommend not traveling,” she said.
Walensky and other U.S. officials said this weekend is a great weekend to get your vaccine. White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients said that “it’s critical that being vaccinated is part of their pre-holiday checklist.”
- “Getting vaccinated is free. It’s easy and convenient. It’s safe and effective. And it’s never, ever been more important,” he said, per Newsweek.
Do people travel over Labor Day weekend?
Health officials have cautioned Americans about traveling during holiday weekends, fearing the spread of the coronavirus will only increase as people move about airports, bus stations and gas stations along highway roads. These concerns will only increase now because of the spread of the delta variant, which is highly transmissible.
The Transportation Security Administration said it screened 3 million people during the 2020 Labor Day weekend. That was before the COVID-19 vaccine was widely available, too.
What happened in 2020 over Labor Day weekend?
Dr. William Schaffner, Vanderbilt University infectious disease specialist, told CNBC at the time that the weekend was an “accelerator weekend” that would set the stage for the fall.
- “This is another holiday and we will see what the general population does, how careful they are or how care free they are. I have a fair amount of trepidation, frankly, because it looks as though a very substantial portion of our population wants to be out and about very freely in groups, without masks, not paying attention to social distancing.”
It’s unclear what Labor Day weekend will mean for the 2021 fall season.",2021-09-03T17:03:20Z,2021,3,10
https://www.deseret.com/coronavirus/2021/7/26/22594190/fully-vaccinated-covid-symptoms-does-it-happen/,It’s rare for fully vaccinated people to have COVID-19 symptoms,Deseret News,2021-07-27T01:00:00Z,"New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that COVID-19 breakthrough infections — especially those with COVID-19 symptoms — are rare for vaccinated Americans, according to ABC News.
- New documents from the CDC — which were obtained by ABC News — suggest that symptomatic COVID-19 cases among the fully vaccinated are rare.
The documents said about 153,000 out of 156 million fully vaccinated people got COVID-19 infections as of last week, per ABC News.
- These cases are only symptomatic COVID-19 cases — not asymptomatic — showing that symptomatic breakthrough cases are rare.
Can fully vaccinated people get COVID-19?
Yes. As I wrote for the Deseret News, people who are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus can get the COVID-19 disease. The vaccines are not 100% preventative of the illness.
As the date suggests, Dr. Matt Willis, public health director for Marin County in Northern California, told California local news station KGO-TV that most COVID-19 cases among the fully vaccinated are asymptomatic — or at least mild. The vaccine isn’t perfect, he said.
- “It’s more like a dimmer switch than it is a light switch. It’s not an on and off. It’s on a continuum of protection,” he said. “And I think that’s an important message because otherwise, people might interpret breakthrough cases as a sign the vaccine is not effective.”
Dr. Esther Choo, professor of emergency medicine at Oregon Health and Science University, said on Yahoo Finance Live that we should expect more breakthrough cases.
- “There’s a lot of talk about how people are getting COVID anyway, even though they’re vaccinated, and that is true and that is expected because there’s no vaccine that’s 100% all the time,” Choo told Yahoo Finance Live.",2021-07-27T01:00:00Z,2021,3,10
https://www.deseret.com/utah/2021/11/8/22766073/should-people-had-covid-19-get-credit-natural-immunity-dont-want-vaccine-mandate-utah-legislature/,Should people who’ve had COVID-19 get credit for ‘natural immunity’ if they don’t want the vaccine?,Deseret News,2021-11-09T00:59:19Z,"A bill intended to ensure Utahns who’ve previously had COVID-19 can claim natural immunity against the virus to avoid being required by their employers to get vaccinated or submit to weekly testing is on the agenda for the special session of the Utah Legislature that starts Tuesday.
“I think the key is we’re trying to strike that balance between personal freedoms and public health and government overreach. And it’s not easy,” said Senate Majority Assistant Whip Kirk Cullimore, R-Draper, the sponsor of SB2004, which expands exemptions to workplace COVID-19 vaccine mandates.
The bill goes beyond the exemptions allowed under new federal rules for President Joe Biden’s vaccine mandate for large businesses nationwide that were put on hold Saturday pending a review by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals at the request of five states, including Utah, and several private companies.
In addition to medical and religious exemptions, the bill would allow a current or prospective employee to claim in a statement that being vaccinated against COVID-19 would “conflict with a sincerely held personal belief” that apparently would not need to be spelled out.
“People need to take a measure of personal responsibility in doing their part for public health, and I don’t think it’s inappropriate for businesses to do their part as well. But I think there needs to be that leeway in the law that allows for people who have legitimate reasons for being exempted,” Cullimore said.
Those reasons include having previously had COVID-19, he said, although what’s known as “natural immunity” is not specified in the bill. The U.S. Department of Labor rules do “not offer any exemptions to vaccination requirements based on ‘natural immunity’ or the presence of antibodies from a previous infection.”
Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, who told reporters last week he wanted to see an exemption for Utahns who have had the coronavirus, said the data he’s seen suggested they may be more protected against COVID-19 than someone who’s fully vaccinated, meaning it’s been two week or more since their initial doses.
“Why are they being discriminated against?” Adams asked, since there have been more than 32,000 “breakthrough” cases of the virus among fully vaccinated Utahns. He said he supports vaccinations, including for those who’ve already had COVID-19, but they shouldn’t be treated differently if they don’t get the shots.
“I’m trying to protect lives and livelihoods. I’m trying to keep people at work and keep people safe. If having COVID allows people to be safe we surely ought to allow them to stay at work,” the Senate president said, adding that the issue “isn’t political. It’s using data to make decisions to keep people at work.”
Cullimore said the conflicts between the bill and the federal rules could be dealt with later, depending on the outcome of the court challenge. Regardless of what happens to the federal mandate, he said the legislation is needed because some Utah businesses are already voluntarily imposing vaccine requirements.
What experts say about ‘natural immunity’
Doctors and public health experts say even someone who has had COVID-19 should be vaccinated against the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to recommend vaccination against the virus for all eligible persons, including those who have been previously infected.
“The data is clear now,” said Dr. Emily Spivak, a University of Utah Health infectious diseases physician, citing recent CDC data from 187 U.S. hospitals that show people who had COVID-19 three to six months ago are at five times higher risk of being infected again than those who’ve gotten the shots.
An earlier study from Israel found that unvaccinated people previously infected with COVID-19 had greater immunity against the highly contagious delta variant of the virus than those fully vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine — and also that vaccines enhance the protection provided by having already been sick.
In a report released in late October analyzing those and other studies, the CDC said both people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and those who’ve previously had the virus have a low risk of subsequent infection for at least six months.
But, the CDC report said, vaccines typically offer a more consistent and stronger antibody response.
“The take-home is if you’ve had COVID-19, depending on how long ago it was, you may be protected. But we honestly can’t tell you,” Spivak said. “There is no question that getting a vaccine after having had COVID-19 really will almost 100% protect you from being in the hospital with COVID-19.”
Dr. Brandon Webb, an Intermountain Healthcare infectious diseases physician, said what’s known about natural immunity to COVID-19 “is still very much in evolution,” making it a difficult public health policy to message and implement.
“The concept of recognizing natural immunity is reasonable scientifically, but has some very important practical limitations,” Webb said, including what he termed “a commonly held misconception that if natural immunity is valid, preventative measures like social restrictions, masks and vaccines are not necessary.”
The reality, he said, is “allowing the infection to simply run its course unchecked would be catastrophic in terms of lives lost, overwhelming health care resources and economic impact.” Plus, natural immunity can vary, wanes over time and is difficult to accurately verify with the tests that are currently available.
There’s also “concern that embracing natural immunity will undermine vaccination efforts,” Webb said, adding that he thinks “it’s likely that the unilateral messaging about vaccination without recognizing what we do and do not yet know about the merits of natural immunity has likely enhanced vaccine hesitancy rather than address it.”
Spivak said there is “evidence that getting vaccinated after having COVID-19 is much more protective against getting reinfected than natural immunity. Natural immunity can be varied,” while vaccine immunity “is very predictable and tends to be sort of standard across groups, across ages and types of patients.”
There are a few exceptions, largely people who have a weakened immune system due to leukemia, uncontrolled HIV and other medical conditions, as well as those who require immune-suppressing therapy to treat diseases like some cancers or because they’ve had an organ transplant.
Han Kim, a professor of public health at Westminster College in Salt Lake City, warned allowing a personal exemption to a COVID-19 vaccine requirement is “a giant loophole” that permits anyone to opt out of the shots. California and other states have done away with similar exemptions for vaccinations, he said.
Still, Kim said he believes “the hard-core anti-vaccination folks” are a small minority in Utah, since nearly 60% of those eligible for the shots — now anyone 5 and older — are fully vaccinated. He said those opposed to the vaccines are vocal enough that they’re “dictating a lot of the politics.”",2021-11-09T00:59:19Z,2021,4,11

(AP) — Eighteen states, including Utah, filed three separate lawsuits Friday to stop President Joe Biden’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for federal contractors, arguing that the requirement violates federal law.
Attorneys general from Alaska, Arkansas, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming signed on to one lawsuit, which was filed in a federal district court in Missouri. Another group of states including Georgia, Alabama, Idaho, Kansas, South Carolina, Utah and West Virginia filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Georgia.
Texas also sued individually on Friday.
The states asked a federal judge to block Biden’s requirement that all employees of federal contractors be vaccinated against the coronavirus by Dec. 8, arguing that the mandate violates federal procurement law and is an overreach of federal power.
“If the federal government attempts to unconstitutionally exert its will and force federal contractors to mandate vaccinations, the workforce and businesses could be decimated, further exacerbating the supply chain and workforce crises,” Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, a Republican, said in a statement. “The federal government should not be mandating vaccinations, and that’s why we filed suit today – to halt this illegal, unconstitutional action.”
New Hampshire’s Republican Attorney General John Formella said in a statement that COVID vaccines are safe, effective and encouraged but that the benefits “do not justify violating the law.”
Florida sued on Thursday, bringing to 19 the number of states challenging the Biden administration mandate in four federal courts.
Biden has argued that sweeping vaccine mandates will help end the deadly pandemic, but Republicans nationwide have opposed the vaccination requirements and have threatened to bring similar legal challenges.
Texas filed a similar lawsuit Friday in a federal district court in a federal court in Galveston, Texas, seeking to block enforcement of the mandate.
“The Biden Administration has repeatedly expressed its disdain for Americans who choose not to get a vaccine, and it has committed repeated and abusive federal overreach to force upon Americans something they do not want,” said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, in a statement. “The federal government does not have the ability to strip individuals of their choice to get a vaccine or not. If the President thinks his patience is wearing thin, he is clearly underestimating the lack of patience from Texans whose rights he is infringing.”
A number of states have also said they will challenge Biden’s plan to have the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration issue a rule that would mandate vaccines for all private businesses with 100 or more employees.
“We will not allow the Biden administration to circumvent the law or force hardworking Georgians to choose between their livelihood or this vaccine,” Republican Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia said in a statement.
The Democratic Party of Georgia called the lawsuit a “dangerous political stunt.”
Florida filed a separate lawsuit against the federal mandate on Thursday. All the suits argue that the president doesn’t have the authority to issue the rule and that it violates procurement law. The suits also argue that the rule violates the 10th Amendment reserving power to the states, illegally uses federal spending to coerce the states, and that 60 days of public comment wasn’t properly allowed.
The Georgia-led suit, for example, argues that such a rule could only stand if Congress passed it in a law.
“Biden has again demonstrated open disdain for the rule of law in seizing power Congress never gave him,” Republican Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said.
The states argue that large number of federal contract workers will quit, meaning states will have to choose between breaching the contracts because of a reduced labor force that can’t do all the work, or breaching the contracts by retaining unvaccinated employees in violation of federal rules.
All but two of the states that have sued trail the national average in vaccination rate. Only New Hampshire and Florida exceed the nationwide rate.",2021-10-30T21:32:06Z,2021,4,11
https://www.deseret.com/utah/2021/10/29/22750753/do-utahns-still-like-gov-spencer-cox-new-poll-numbers-approval-ratings-job-performance-politics/,Do Utahns still like Gov. Spencer Cox? New poll numbers are in,Deseret News,2021-10-29T17:02:21Z,"As he nears the end of his first year in office, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox’s job approval ratings have dipped slightly.
That’s according to a new Deseret News/Hinckley Institute of Politics poll, which shows the wave of high approval ratings Cox rode in the early months of his administration has receded — though a majority of Utahns still support him.
Asked whether they approve or disapprove of Cox’s job performance, 55% of Utahns said they approve while 26% said they disapprove.
More specifically, 23% said they strongly approve, 32% said they somewhat approve, 14% said they somewhat disapprove, and 12% said they strongly disapprove. Another 19% said they didn’t know.
Dan Jones & Associates conducted the poll of 746 registered Utah voters from Oct. 14-21. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.54 percentage points.
The poll is the latest of a series of Deseret News/Hinckley Institute polls that have gauged Utahn’s feelings about Cox throughout the year and shown Cox’s approval ratings peaked at 66% in March, lingered at 65% in April, then dropped slightly to 58% in June. That latter poll was conducted June 18-25 by Scott Rasmussen of 1,000 registered Utah voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.
Still, more than half of Utahns approve of Cox’s job performance — and that’s good news to the Republican governor’s spokeswoman Jennifer Napier Pearce.
“Ten months in, we’re very grateful that the majority of Utahns support the governor’s vision of helping families, keeping us safe, strengthening the economy and providing opportunity for all,” Pearce said in a prepared statement to the Deseret News when told of the poll results.
Despite the slight dip, Cox’s approval ratings do still appear strong, said Jason Perry, director of the University of Utah’s Hinckley Institute of Politics.
“He has been remarkably steady,” Perry said, “in spite of so many tough issues that are facing him but also facing the state. Whether it’s unemployment, inflation, federal vaccine mandates, there have been a lot of very difficult issues, and he’s clearly not taking the blame.”
Perry said it’s important to note that even though there’s been a slight drop in approval, his disapprovals have not changed dramatically. They’ve gone up slightly, he noted, but have stayed steady as well.
“So you really can’t get an indication that there’s a big slide and they’re turning from approve to disapprove. That just hasn’t happened,” Perry said.
As Cox approaches the one-year mark in office, Perry said he’s keeping relatively good favor with most Utahns. That’s a position he likely feels good about, Perry said.
“The issues that we are facing are significant, and any one of them are the kinds of things that can have a very negative impact on a state leader. And they haven’t,” Perry said.
Slightly more Utahns tend to approve of Cox when asked specifically about his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, the biggest issue he’s grappled with since he took office in January. However, slightly more Utahns also tend to disapprove, showing the governor’s job on pandemic divides Utahns slightly more.
About 57% said they approve of Cox’s handling of the pandemic, while 31% said they disapprove. A smaller number of Utahns — 11% — said they haven’t made up their mind.
More specifically, 25% said they strongly approved of Cox’s handling of the pandemic, 32% said they somewhat approved, 18% said they somewhat disapproved, and 13% said they strongly disapproved.
Still, there continues to be a faction of Utahns that aren’t sure about how they feel about the first-year governor, with 19% who said they didn’t know what to think about his job performance.
“There is a segment of our Utah population that is waiting to see,” Perry said. “They’re concerned about significant issues that they’re facing ... It’s not because they don’t know Gov. Cox. It’s because the circumstances themselves are putting them in a position where they’re not sure how they feel about him and because the issues are so big and the opinions are so varied.”",2021-10-29T17:02:21Z,2021,4,11
https://www.deseret.com/coronavirus/2021/10/11/22721254/dr-fauci-masks-indoors-fully-vaccinated/,Dr. Fauci says it’s ‘tough to predict’ the future for fully vaccinated people,Deseret News,2021-10-12T00:00:00Z,"Dr. Anthony Fauci said it’s “tough to predict” when fully vaccinated people can spend time indoors without masks on.
Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN over the weekend that it might take some time to figure out when people can mingle indoors without masks.
- “It’s always tough to predict that,” he told CNN. “I think if we continue to go down in the cases that we’re seeing right now and more and more people get vaccinated, as the dynamics of the outbreak, namely the amount of virus circling the community goes down, I hope we’ll be able to pull back on some of those restrictions to get closer to what we really feel is normal in the community.”
- “I hope that’s soon but I can’t give a prediction on that date,” he added.
Fauci acknowledged that coronavirus cases are dipping as we head toward the winter. Officials and experts said that more vaccinations can stop the coronavirus from spreading far this winter, as I wrote for the Deseret News. The delta variant surge may be tapering out, but that doesn’t mean the virus won’t stop completely.
Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Stanford, told The New York Times that improved vaccination and natural immunity can bring an end to the pandemic, or at least stop us from seeing COVID-19 cases similar to what we saw in 2020.
- “Most of us don’t think we’re going to see the terrible surge we saw last winter,” she said. “That was horrific. I hope we never have to live through something like that again.”",2021-10-12T00:00:00Z,2021,4,11

- But the early reports also suggest that some common COVID-19 symptoms don’t occur among those who are infected with the omicron variant.
Per NBC News, most evidence about omicron variant symptoms comes from anecdotal data taken by infected patients. This is why some of the most common omicron variant symptoms include cough, fatigue, tiredness and congestion.
- However, Dr. Katherine Poehling, an infectious disease specialist and vaccinologist at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist in North Carolina, told NBC News that one major COVID-19 symptom is missing among the anecdotal data — the loss of taste and smell.
In fact, some research suggests that 48% of people with the original mutation of the novel coronavirus had a loss of smell, and 41% had a loss of taste. But among a small group of omicron patients, that number jumped down to 23% for loss of taste and 12% for loss of smell, according to The New York Times.
- “It’s unclear, though, whether these differences are because of Omicron or some other factor, like vaccination status,” per The New York Times.
Still, it’s clear that the omicron variant has been creating unique symptoms among patients. For example, the omicron variant, in many ways, might feel like the traditional cold, according to professor Tim Spector, who helps run the ZOE COVID symptoms app.
- Similarly, Dr. Amir Khan, a physician with the U.K.’s National Health Service, told the U.K. newspaper The Sun that night sweats have become a common omicron variant symptom among patients he has seen.
- And don’t forget what Dr. Angelique Coetzee, chairwoman of the South African Medical Association who first sounded the alarm on the omicron variant, told the “BBC Sunday” at the beginning of all of this. Her patients had “unusual symptoms” from omicron, including body aches and pains with a bit of a headache,” she told the BBC.",2021-12-24T03:30:00Z,2021,4,11

Offensive lineman Clark Barrington climbed onto the railing at Martin Stadium to salute the thousands of BYU fans who made the trip to the Palouse to watch their beloved Cougars play, including a couple dozen relatives and family friends.
Defensive back Malik Moore joked after dropping a couple interceptions — easier to do after a win and one successful pick, no doubt — and bruising running back Tyler Allgeier said he was as sore as he’s ever been after a game.
Thirty-two carries, including seven straight when everybody in the place knew the ball was going to BYU’s best player and he ran it down Wazzu’s throat anyway, will do that to a guy.

“We knew that we would face adversity, and one thing we have been focusing on all week is getting through that adversity and staying up and helping each other out and pushing along. So that is what the vibe was in the locker room — that we are going to get through this, we are going to continue to drive the ball, our defense will do their best to get stops, and we will come out on top.” — BYU offensive lineman Clark Barrington
Imagine what Arizona coaches are calling their 19-game slide.
Whatever the case, this is a win BYU desperately needed, what with Bronco Mendenhall and his 6-2 Virginia Cavaliers coming back to Provo this week for an 8:15 p.m. late-night special Saturday at LaVell Edwards Stadium.
“Getting a win, it always boosts your confidence, and so it is nice to have another win,” said Barrington, the left guard who teamed with left tackle Blake Freeland to clear the way for Allgeier to pick up 9 yards on his final carry and secure the first down so BYU wouldn’t have to call on Spokane native Ryan Rehkow to pin WSU deep in the final minute.
Added Moore, the ballhawking safety who invited social media followers after the game to needle him all they wanted for the drops — for one day: “I think for sure it picks up our confidence a lot, and shows us we are not out of it, we are no scrubs, you know?,” he said. “I think everybody’s chin was down, worrying about the last two games. This game really proved to us that we still got it, we are still a good team, we have won six games. Not a lot of teams are doing that, so we’re good.”
In getting bowl eligible before Halloween — an unexpected development for a team that lost Zach Wilson and more than a dozen other key contributors — the Cougars are sort of playing with house money from here on out, with Virginia and USC looming as the only possible stumbling blocks to a 10-win season.
Put your can’t catch jokes down below! After today not a word 😂😂
“We knew that we would face adversity, and one thing we have been focusing on all week is getting through that adversity and staying up and helping each other out and pushing along,” Barrington said. “So that is what the vibe was in the locker room — that we are going to get through this, we are going to continue to drive the ball, our defense will do their best to get stops, and we will come out on top.”
BYU expected a highly motivated WSU team after the school fired head coach Nick Rolovich and four assistants for refusing to comply to a vaccine mandate for state employees, and they got it. Credit defensive coordinator Ilaisa Tuiaki for designing a game plan that held Wazzu to 257 passing yards and 19 points.
“We lost to a good team,” said WSU tackle Abraham Lucas. “We didn’t roll over, either. I think a lot of people nationwide and even (in Pullman) probably expected us to just roll over and die.”
BYU didn’t.
“I thought they had tons of energy,” Sitake said of the crimson Cougars. “It was a lot of fun. I feel really fortunate and happy that we got the win.”
Allgeier, who is now seventh in the country in rushing yards (861) and sixth in rushing touchdowns (11), said another win in Pac-12 territory was just what the doctor ordered before what is sure to be an emotional game against Mendenhall and company.
“I would say it brings the confidence back up,” Allgeier said. “We are 0-0 now, but we gotta keep that momentum going forward.”
It won’t be easy against the Hoos, who beat Georgia Tech 48-40 on Saturday in Charlottesville and have won four straight behind the sensational quarterbacking of Brennan Armstrong.
The 6-foot-2, 215-pound junior from Shelby, Ohio, leads the country in passing yards (3,220) and is second in passing yards per game (402.5). Virginia is fourth in the country in total offense, putting up 539.9 yards per game with former BYU offensive coordinator Robert Anae doing the play-calling.

Defensively, though, the Hoos are below average. They are giving up 432.8 yards per game, which ranks them 105th in the country. They are especially susceptible to the run — ranking 113th in rushing defense.
The Cougars enter Mendenhall’s homecoming a bit shorthanded, as starting center James Empey and starting receiver Gunner Romney left the WSU win with injuries and didn’t return. Sitake said both are “doubtful” to play this week.
Right tackle Harris LaChance has been out for several weeks, but freshman Campbell Barrington has filled in admirably.
BYU continues to be thin at the defensive line, not good news with explosive Virginia coming to town. Lorenzo Fauatea and Caden Haws and Jacob Palu missed the WSU game.

Dr. Mark Dybul, a professor at Georgetown University Medical Center’s Department of Medicine and immunologist, said there will be a COVID-19 vaccine-resistant variant by spring 2022, according to Fortune.
- “The faster we get boosted, the better off we’ll be for the next couple of months,” he said. “Sadly, every prediction I’ve made has pretty much come true. I hope I’m wrong this time, but I think by March, April, May, we will have a fully vaccine-resistant variant. There’s simply no way you can have such low rates of vaccination around the world with the virus ping-ponging between vaccinated and unvaccinated people. I’m an immunologist. The probability of us seeing a vaccine-resistant strain is very high.”
However, Dybul said that there will be advancements in therapeutics and vaccines to help stop the massive spread of that variant. Nasal sprays could help stop variants, too.
- “I think we’ll have products like that in the next year and a half or so,” said Dybul, who was trained by Dr. Anthony Fauci, per Fortune. “So the longer term will be okay, but the next year and a half could be pretty rough.”
In October, Wales’ first minister, Mark Drakeford, said he was concerned that a new COVID-19 variant resistant to vaccines will arrive soon.
- “There is at least a possibility that that variant will turn out to be more resistant to vaccination than the current one we have,” he said.
Scientists in Germany warned in October that an older COVID-19 variant — called the A.30 variant — can evade the Pfizer and AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines, too.
Fauci warned in September that a “monster variant” could arrive that would make the delta variant look weak in comparison.
- “There’s always a risk of, as you get more circulation of the virus in the community, that you’ll get enough accumulation of new mutations to get a variant substantially different than the ones we’re seeing now,” Fauci said on the MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”
Correction: This article previously said Dr. Mark Dybul said a variant could come in spring 2023. He said spring 2022.",2021-11-18T19:37:06Z,2021,4,11
https://www.deseret.com/coronavirus/2021/10/23/22736954/unvaccinated-people-catch-covid-19/,Here’s how often unvaccinated people will catch COVID-19,Deseret News,2021-10-23T14:00:00Z,"A new study has revealed how often unvaccinated people will catch COVID-19 in a given length of time.
The study — which comes from the Yale School of Public Health — reviewed new data on natural immunity, per The Hill.
- Unvaccinated people should expect to catch COVID-19 once every 16 months, the study said.
Natural immunity does not last overly long, the study found. The researchers reviewed a model where everyone was either infected with COVID-19 or vaccinated against the virus.
- “Our results are based on average times of waning immunity across multiple infected individuals,” Hayley Hassler, a co-author of the study, told Yale Daily News. “Any one of those individuals may experience longer or shorter durations of immunity depending on immune status, cross-immunity, age, and multiple other factors.”
Of course, this doesn’t have to be the case. People could cut down their risk of getting infected with the coronavirus if they get the COVID-19 vaccine or wear masks to prevent the spread.
Recently, there has been a heavy discussion about natural immunity. In fact, politicians, athletes and workers have been trying to make the case that those with natural immunity don’t need to get the COVID-19 vaccine, according to Deseret News.
A number of Republicans have been saying natural immunity is effective and long-lasting. The Republicans have introduced legislation to take natural immunity into account when creating regulations to protect people against the disease.
- “Now more than ever, we need to pursue every scientific measure — such as natural immunity — that can help mitigate the pandemic without threatening people’s jobs, our economy or denying Americans access to everyday life activities based on COVID-19 vaccination status,” said Rep. Diana Harshbarger, R-Tenn., per the Deseret News.",2021-10-23T14:00:00Z,2021,4,11
https://www.deseret.com/utah/2021/12/22/22850010/holiday-travel-airlines-safety-covid-omicron-vaccinate-masks-get-tested/,Heading for the skies this holiday season? Here’s what you should know,Deseret News,2021-12-23T04:00:00Z,"U.S. highways and airports will be back to near pre-pandemic volumes over the busy end-of-year travel season and public health officials are urging safe practices for both the journey and the holiday celebrations as COVID-19 case counts, driven by the omicron variant, continue to surge.
AAA is predicting nearly 110 million U.S. travelers will be heading out of town from Dec. 23 to Jan. 2, exceeding 2020’s holiday traffic by almost 28 million and coming up just shy of 2019’s pre-pandemic travel flow of 119 million over the same period.
About 6.4 million travelers will get to their holiday destinations via the air. The Salt Lake City International Airport reports it is expecting 25,000-plus departing passengers Wednesday and Thursday, more than double pre-Christmas departures last year.
Travel industry leaders are joining public health experts in imploring all travelers to follow guidance on safe practices and, most importantly, to get vaccinated or boosted.
“With vaccines widely available, conditions are much different and many people feel a greater level of comfort traveling, but travelers will still be mindful of the pandemic and the new omicron variant,” said Aldo Vazquez, AAA Utah spokesperson.
The COVID-19 omicron variant is now accounting for most of the new infections in the U.S. and experts warn the highly communicable strain will heighten risk of illness for airline travelers.
In Wednesday reporting by The Hill, a leading medical adviser to a group representing nearly 300 airlines said in a new interview that aircraft passengers are two or three times more likely to be infected with COVID-19 on a flight since the emergence of the omicron variant.
“Whatever the risk was with delta, we would have to assume the risk would be two to three times greater with omicron, just as we’ve seen in other environments,” Dr. David Powell, physician and medical adviser to the International Air Transport Association, told Bloomberg News.
He added that “it’s just that the relative risk has probably increased, just as the relative risk of going to the supermarket or catching a bus has increased with omicron.”
Air travelers who choose to stage protests on airplanes or at airport facilities, where masks are required, will be facing zero tolerance responses from security personnel under a no-warning policy the Federal Aviation Administration instituted in January. Incidents that escalate to verbal threats or physical assaults of other passengers or airline employees come with penalties that include fines of up to $35,000 and jail time.
And unruly airline passengers may face additional consequences for bad behavior under a new partnership between the Transportation Security Administration and FAA.
Under the partnership, the FAA will share information of passengers facing fines for unruly behavior with TSA which may remove the passenger from TSA PreCheck screening eligibility, which is a privilege reserved for low-risk travelers, according to a posting on the FAA website.
“TSA has zero tolerance for unruly behaviors, especially those involving physical assault occurring aboard aircraft. We have tremendous respect for airport staff, gate agents and flight crews that get people safely to their destinations,” said TSA Administrator David Pekoske. “This partnership with FAA will help ensure the safety and security of all passengers and hold those who violate federal regulations accountable for their actions.”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that the best way to minimize COVID-19 risk and keep family members and friends safe is to get vaccinated if you’re eligible.
The CDC also posted this list of guidelines ahead of 2021 holiday travel and celebrations:
- Get a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as you can. Find a vaccine.
- Wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth to help protect yourself and others.
- Stay 6 feet apart from others who don’t live with you.
- Avoid crowds and poorly ventilated indoor spaces.
- Test to prevent spread to others.
- Wash your hands often with soap and water. Use hand sanitizer if soap and water aren’t available.",2021-12-23T04:00:00Z,2021,4,11
https://www.deseret.com/coronavirus/2021/11/9/22772149/beating-the-great-resignation-at-a-family-business-in-boise-restaurant-industry-unemployment-rate/,Tips for keeping employees happy from a Boise restaurant,Deseret News,2021-11-10T05:00:00Z,"Seated in a leather booth at Jalapeño’s Bar and Grill in Boise, Irma Valdivia scrolls through text messages from one of her servers. Forty-five and short in stature, she wears a Chanel pearl necklace nestled against a silky brown shirt — the uniform of a successful businesswoman. “I will now only be working as follows: 5:30 to close Wednesday, Thursday and Friday,” she reads in a deep voice. “Old Irma would have told her, ‘Monique, that’s not gonna work out, thank you and best of luck.’ New Irma says, ‘I gotta figure how to keep her on at least one or two days.’ ”
Amid an uneven economic recovery and the lingering pandemic, many workers have proven reluctant to go back to their jobs, making them a prized resource and something like an endangered species. Depending on who you identify with, either they’re behaving like greedy squirrels hoarding unemployment insurance nuts or like prey that, for once, get to turn the gun on the hunter. Business owners and managers ponder how best to lure a server out of their living room: With bonuses? Increased wages? Time off?
Economists, meanwhile, rattle off the factors holding workers back. Fear of being exposed to a new strain of the coronavirus ranks high on the list, even with vaccines widely available. Low pay, lack of benefits, rigid work schedules and the difficulties of child care follow.
What’s clear is how this scarcity manifests itself — a labor crunch that has hit businesses like a gut punch, especially in the hospitality sector. As of August, the unemployment rate for bar and restaurant workers was 8.7%, about three percentage points higher than the overall rate, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Jalapeño’s is an exception. The company could use some extra hands for busy shifts, as “hiring” signs indicate. But most of about 100 employees have come back to work for the three-restaurant chain in southwestern Idaho. The Valdivias credit years of building trust with workers, giving them a voice and, more recently, generous financial incentives.
“They actually treat this restaurant like it was their own,” says Leticia Valdivia McLaughlin, Irma’s sister and business partner.
Employers that supported workers prior to the pandemic are less likely to be affected by the shortage, labor experts say. Their financial recovery has also been quicker, putting them in a better position to cushion future economic blows.
“All of these things will probably help them be a step ahead compared to other employers who may not be doing the same thing,” says Yannet Lathrop, a senior researcher and policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project, a research and advocacy group. Jalapeño’s may provide a blueprint for other small businesses that hope to keep attracting employees, even in the midst of a public health crisis.
Watching Irma climb into her sleek black Range Rover, you could be forgiven for guessing that she comes from money, though she built her business from scratch. The SUV’s rear plate reads, in black letters, “PATRONA,” a Spanish term for a female boss. But she wasn’t exactly born with a silver spoon in her mouth. She grew up in a family of 10 children, raised by Mexican immigrants who toiled away in the fields around Boise in the 1970s. Later, she and her brothers worked for an uncle who owns a restaurant and the family was inspired to start their own.
Irma partnered with her sister, and they settled on a Mexican cantina. After opening the first location in Nampa in 2006, they expanded with another in Boise three years later. In 2019, they opened a third store four blocks from Boise State University. Each sibling manages a location, but they often make important decisions as a team. This doesn’t mean that they agree on everything. In March 2020, their partnership was put to its biggest test yet.
Near the end of that month, Idaho’s governor issued a stay-at-home order to limit the spread of the coronavirus. The Valdivias faced a tough choice: Would they remain open and provide curbside orders or shut down indefinitely? How many employees would they keep? Sitting in a freezing-cold office, they went back and forth. “It was like beating a dead horse,” says Leticia, 51.
Mike, a baby-faced 37-year-old, favored shutting down, worried about getting himself or his staff exposed to the virus. His sisters, however, preferred to stay open as long as they could — as long as their employees were on board.
Businesses across the country had to make similar choices. When researchers surveyed 5,800 small businesses about their response to the pandemic, they found that those in the food service industry cut payroll by more than half, according to an article published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. More than 1 in 3 restaurant workers filed for unemployment in the spring of 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
In the end, the Valdivias agreed to disagree. The sisters stayed open and Mike ended up closing his location. On the last day, his roughly 20 employees filed out of the restaurant, carrying bags filled with perishable food. The workers who most needed the money — those with mortgages and families — were sent to another location to help fill pickup orders. Those who were still in high school volunteered to go on unemployment, as did some of the younger workers at the sisters’ restaurants.
A few days later, Katy Marrow, 29, and a handful of employees gathered around Leticia in the kitchen of her restaurant. They’d have to go on unemployment for now, until the Valdivias worked out how to bring employees back safely. But all agreed to come back to work as soon as they could, coronavirus or not.
Marrow had been in the service industry for over 10 years but had never been furloughed. Suddenly, she had to worry about successfully applying for benefits. “It was a scary thought — being without money or a job,” she says. She soon learned that the additional $600 provided each week under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act amounted to just half of what she made in tips.
But the money wasn’t all that she missed. At Jalapeño’s, she found working conditions a world apart from the corporate restaurants where she’d worked. “We’re all a lot closer,” says Marrow. After only two weeks, she put on her black uniform T-shirt and headed back to work, right as the restaurant settled into a new rhythm. Masked cooks prepared meals for her to pack into as many as four boxes. Phone lines were added to keep up with the growing volume of calls. Online ordering became an option. The patio in front of the restaurant was reconfigured to serve as a drive-thru. Loyal customers streamed by, picking up $30 foil containers filled with tacos and leaving generous tips behind.
There’s a central thread running through the tapestry of complaints voiced by business owners since the economy surged back to life, alongside supply chain backlogs and vaccine mandates: Workers don’t want to work anymore. The alleged culprit? Unemployment benefits. In the eyes of many, would-be employees would rather stay at home and game the system.
A few months ago, 26 states — 25 controlled by the GOP, including Idaho, Wyoming, Utah and Arizona — picked the stick over the carrot and discontinued some or all supplemental programs enacted by Congress, including a measure that provided supplemental unemployment benefits until it was discontinued in September.
Yet, these states saw no noticeable increase in job growth compared with those that maintained the aid, The Wall Street Journal found. Workers in the 22 states that ended all additional benefits in June were only slightly more likely to find a job, according to a team of economists. It’s possible that some “workers earning more with enhanced unemployment insurance benefits than they did working may have decided that low-paid jobs weren’t worth the risk in the middle of a pandemic,” says the National Employment Law Project’s Lathrop. But the takeaway shouldn’t be that low-paid employees are slackers. If anything, she says, “it does say something about how depressed wages have been for a long, long time.”
Employers in Utah and Wyoming pay tipped employees a paltry minimum of $2.13 an hour, with tips making the difference to reach the federal minimum wage of $7.25. The minimum cash wage is slightly higher in Idaho, but residents there have struggled with soaring housing costs due to an influx of transplants, says Jan Roeser, an economist at the Idaho Department of Labor. Idahoans earning minimum wage must work 96 hours a week in order to rent a two-bedroom home, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a policy group.
For many hospitality workers, compensation is only part of the puzzle, as the pandemic brought about a moment of clarity after years of putting up with unfair treatment. Customers can be stingy on tips, or at best, uneven. Bosses are often poorly trained to supervise teams and default to using pressure as a management tool. Sexual harassment has long plagued the sector, as has wage theft.
Heather Lynn Smith, 37, worked for about a decade at the front desk of an economy hotel in the Houston area, part of a national chain. She kept pleading for an hourly raise of $1.50, but it was denied over and over again. After the hotel reopened in May last year, the owner provided gloves and masks only once and refused to say whether she would keep employees who fell sick with COVID-19. “It was just a very toxic environment,” says Smith. All the while, she worked a second full-time job as a truancy officer at a local junior high school, until she and her husband, who also had a job, were able to pay off some debts. Quitting became an option. Finally, in September, she left.
A recent survey of 30,000 job seekers by Joblist, an online job-search platform, found that 38% of former hospitality workers were seeking to transition out of the industry. More than half said no incentives would lure them back.
This is a teachable moment for employers, says Rosemary Batt, a professor in human resource studies at Cornell University. “The pandemic has taught all of us that health and family come first, and many have chosen that over making more money,” she says. “So employers need to focus on the quality of jobs and daily working conditions: health and safety above all, paid sick leave, predictable schedules — which very few front-line service workers have.”
It may not require an extreme makeover. She reports that employers who provided a predictable schedule prior to the pandemic were shielded from high turnover once it hit, according to research by her students that has yet to be published. That history also helped such employers bounce back financially more quickly.
One difference between Jalapeño’s and other businesses is that it provides more than a paycheck. It provides a “support system,” Irma says.
The Valdivias throw birthday parties for employees’ kids — when they’re not babysitting them. The owners pitch in to clean toilets and help the cooks cut chips. They’ve stopped counting the number of times they’ve given a stranded server a ride.
Irma says she acts as a mother, a mentor, a car dealer and sometimes as an immigration attorney for her employees, most of whom are Hispanic. “Once you set that foundation — how you’re going to treat your employees and how you’re going to be good to them, they’re willing to trust you and stick with you a little bit,” says Mike.
But the Valdivias have recently turned to more traditional means to hold on to employees. They used hundreds of thousands in loans provided by the federal Paycheck Protection Program to pay bonuses. They moved to permanently increase wages by up to 30%, passing some of the cost on to consumers. Chefs and dishwashers earn around $20 an hour, and servers are paid about $6 an hour before tips. Workers also have more flexible schedules now. They’ve been able to take vacation time this summer even as Jalapeño’s readied itself for a busy comeback season. One employee took at least two days off to take care of a sick cat.
But there’s a flip side to the new economic reality, which is that employees get to call the shots. “They have the upper hand now — 100 percent,” says Irma. Because of that, some feel like they can push the limits. One worker who injured his hand in off hours told her he’d take the rest of the week off. Servers sometimes text at the last minute to request time off on busy Saturday nights. These days, Irma has no choice but to go along with it.
Yet she sees most of these changes as overwhelmingly positive. She’s the first to acknowledge that, historically, Mexican restaurants were built on the back of cheap, immigrant labor, and likes to think her family is at the vanguard of more humane management in the industry. She’s also come to realize there’s more to life than her own job — she’s gone so far as closing her location on Sundays, like her siblings. A single mom, she’s started going on dates again.
At the same time, she’s achieved prosperity in part through the devotion of her employees who, by their own accounts, have known nothing but hard work all of their lives. Now, she wonders, what happens when the old guard, the workers fiercely devoted to their jobs, retire?
Take Jose Toro, Leticia’s chef of nine years. At 53, he stands in the kitchen eight to 10 hours a day, working the grill in Death Valley-like temperatures, without complaining. “Where are you going to find that quality of employee,” Irma says, “and still not pay them $30 an hour?”

https://www.deseret.com/2021/12/1/22799915/curtains-up-hamilton-on-broadway-cast-thayne-jasperson-utah/,‘Hamilton’’s Thayne Jasperson on the return of Broadway,Deseret News,2021-12-02T05:00:00Z,"A string of pearl-like lights invites guests to the Richard Rodgers Theatre, a stone-walled throwback of a venue named for one half of the most successful duo in the history of the American stage. Rodgers and his longtime writing partner, Oscar Hammerstein, produced much of our contemporary canon, from “Oklahoma!” to “The King and I” to “The Sound of Music.” Tonight, one of the latest additions to that canon — Lin-Manuel Miranda’s “Hamilton” — will take the stage.
And with half an hour until curtain, the line to get inside stretches from the building’s 46th Street facade all the way through an adjacent parking garage, with the very last of it spilling onto 45th. A young woman turns the corner into the garage and, upon seeing that the line wraps around the building, shrieks and smiles. Tonight, even this would-be annoyance looks beautiful.
Somewhere inside, Thayne Jasperson squeezes into a pair of knee-high leather boots right about now. With veins bulging from his arms and a face that looks far younger than his 41 years (riding a bicycle 100 blocks to and from the theater every day can have that effect), he’s been here since the beginning, since the show’s first workshop in January 2014, since its Broadway debut a year later, and throughout its rapid evolution into a stage-transcending cultural phenomenon. His main role is Samuel Seabury, a British loyalist who picks a (brief) fight with Alexander Hamilton, but Jasperson maintains a constant presence as part of the show’s ensemble. He sings, he dances and he acts — all skills born of his childhood in the West.
Originally from Provo, he moved to Wyoming at six months old and, by the time he was eight or nine, had taken up piano, musicals and even clog dancing. “All of my friends made fun of me, saying it was for girls,” he says with a sting you can still feel all these years later. He quit for a while, aside from mandated school musical performances and the occasional song at church. But he came back to theater full time around his 21st birthday.
He found work in a Jackson Hole Playhouse production of “Oklahoma!” then as a member of Salt Lake-based Odyssey Dance Theatre. He appeared in the 2006 Disney Channel movie “High School Musical,” competed in 2008’s season of “So You Think You Can Dance” and made his Broadway debut in 2012’s “Newsies” before impressing the casting directors of “Hamilton” with renditions of “Dear Theodosia” and “Washington on Your Side.” The role he earned was small, but he clung to it. Even before the pandemic shuttered Broadway, he was already the only original cast member left.
The same forces that called him back to perform now call to the audience, with holiday travel offering many outside the New York metro area their first chance to revisit Broadway theater since late 2019. The pandemic ensures that attendance will still feel different — but perhaps not different enough to matter.
Back outside, workers in lime-green jackets instruct the people in line to have their IDs and vaccine cards ready. Both are prerequisites for entry, a reminder that the 15-month shutdown is still fresh.
“Hamilton” has only been open since September, “The Book of Mormon” since November and many other Broadway staples, like “Dear Evan Hansen,” remain closed. The ones that have reopened remain precarious; within a week, Disney’s “Aladdin” reopened, shut down, opened again and shut down again after discovering breakthrough COVID-19 cases among the cast.
The next curtain, Jasperson knows, isn’t guaranteed — despite him and the rest of the cast undergoing testing three times per week and wearing masks whenever they’re not onstage. New York itself follows a similar model, with pretty much every restaurant requiring proof of vaccination to get through the door.
Jasperson is already onstage snapping and dancing with the rest of the cast when the lights dim and the spotlight finds Alexander Hamilton at center stage. “Alexander Hamilton,” he sings, introducing himself to viewers. The audience cheers.
And cheers.
And cheers.
The show pauses. The actors stand frozen, waiting for the enthusiasm to temper. They know to pause; they’d practiced the pause. Because since the show reopened, this has been happening every night.
“It kind of took me back to the days when Lin was in the show,” Jasperson says. “He would always just have outrageous applause.”
This wasn’t the norm before the closure. Back then, Jasperson says, people would clap for Hamilton’s introduction, but “just a normal amount.”
What had become routine became uprooted in mid-March. The first inkling of trouble was when the cast was told after an otherwise-ordinary performance not to take pictures or sign autographs after the show, which is normally standard.
The next day, as Jasperson was getting dressed, he and the rest of the cast got an email telling them the day’s show was canceled. “Oh great,” Jasperson thought. Maybe they would be back for the weekend.
A few days became a few weeks became a few months or, as Jasperson puts it, “this elon- gated thing. And you know,” he adds with a laugh, “I was kind of excited.”
Broadway performers don’t get many breaks, so after a month of downtime in New York — including a brief bout with COVID-19 — Jasperson headed West to Utah, where he spent almost all of the pandemic.
“I love Utah,” he says. “I seriously think it’s the greatest place in the world.” He used his newfound freedom to teach choreography and hone his piano playing, eventually putting on solo performances.
As the lone remaining original cast member, he feels the weight of preserving the show’s original integrity and purpose. His efforts felt worthwhile on opening night.
“The audience was wild,” he says. “They just wanted to stand and clap after every number.”
Three weeks later, my seat neighbor at the show, 60-year-old Sue Blumenfeld, projects the same enthusiasm.
She’s in town from Chicago for a real estate convention, and she couldn’t resist the allure of “Hamilton.” The last performance she saw live, she tells me, was a Mumford and Sons concert in March 2019, and as a lifelong theatergoer (37 years strong, she’s proud to say), she felt overdue.
When I ask her before the show whether it finally feels real, now that she’s sitting in the velvety chair surrounded by the chatter of a full house, she offers an enthusiastic “Yeah!” as though, like me, she’s realizing that this is finally happening.
To be sure, Broadway still isn’t its full self. Right around the corner, at the discount same- day ticket booth in the heart of Times Square, a teller acknowledges that while it’s picking up, it’s not what it once was.
“It’s slowly coming back along with the shows,” she says before a long exhale. “I’m just glad to be back at all.”
Blumenfeld concurs. After Jasperson has donned his regal robe for his brief moment as Samuel Seabury and the intermission has arrived, she offers an observation: “It’s just wonderful,” she says. “Or maybe it’s just live theater.”
Jasperson waits in the orchestra conductor’s pit ahead of Act II. In moments like this one, in the still blackness of a curtain about to go up, he can’t help but feel blessed to be here, making his 9-year-old self proud.
“I’m so grateful to be able to do what I love as a career,” he says, “because not many people get to do that.”
That love starts with the craft; the mastery and precision and rigor required to perform at this level, day after day after day. But it also involves connecting with the audience. It’s tempting to view the audience-performer relationship as one way, but Jasperson doesn’t see it that way. “You feel their energy. It’s a mutual connection,” he says. “You get to see them feel.”
This is what Jasperson loves most about his job. He’s lost track of how many performances of “Hamilton” he’s done, but it’s well over 2,000, and seeing people connect with the material never loses its power. As the stage goes dark, then lights up for the post-show bows, that’s always where his mind goes after the gratitude and the sigh of relief for a job well done — to the faces in the crowd.
“It makes me feel honored that I get to be able to do something that they love and they’re inspired by,” he says. “It’s a beautiful feeling.”
Case in point: At the show’s conclusion, Blumenfeld turns to me with an admission. She and her husband lost their son. Seeing Hamilton and his wife grieve their own son’s loss, therefore, dredged up painful memories. But that just made the experience that much more powerful. “Just unbelievable,” she says as she departs into the anonymity of a crowded Manhattan night. Jasperson still shares that same sort of awe.
But he also isn’t sure how long he’ll keep going. Questions about whether he should still be here have surfaced more and more lately. He prefers to phrase them in religious terms.
“Am I on the journey that God has for me?” he asks. “Sometimes I wonder — was it to come back to do ‘Hamilton’? Or was it to stay in Utah and choreograph and sing in concerts?”
His future mirrors Broadway’s own — uncertain and certain at once. He doesn’t know if he’ll still be around this time next year. With the pandemic still present, no one knows what Broadway will look like in a year. But Jasperson knows he’ll still be working in the arts, and everyone knows Broadway will still be around in some capacity. In this way, his Broadway story is America’s Broadway story. “The Sound of Music,” “Oklahoma!” and other classics have endured for a reason.
Just as he will endure.

Closer to home, when my stepfather was helping teenagers with drug addiction, he became convinced that all my friends and I must be doing drugs.
This idea has a name: Maslow’s hammer, or the “law of the instrument,” based on Abraham Maslow’s famous quote: “If the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail.”
For many epidemiologists and public health officials, every new COVID-19 variant is another nail.
We’re watching this phenomenon take place in real time among public health officials. You likely never realized it, but you’ve been ignoring some Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations your entire life. If you have toddlers, are they in rear-facing car seats? If you’re making brownies, does your family lick the bowl? Do you have elderly relatives that are still driving at night? If you’re of childbearing age, do you use condoms with every sexual encounter with your spouse if you’ve been in an area with Zika present during the past six months (look at a globe — that’s most of it)? If you do any of these things and more, you’re wantonly risking your life and those of your children, according to the CDC.
But with COVID-19, everything changed. Suddenly we became hooked on every word out of the mouths of a handful of suddenly very influential epidemiologists, and their pronouncements have real effects on the lives of families across the country. Their risk tolerance was always zero, but now, their risk tolerance has become our own.
COVID-19 moderates like myself have long decried a lack of off-ramps, and this is why they don’t exist for the public health establishment: There is no tolerable amount of risk allowable.
The problem, then, is when every concern is a nail or, in this analogy, when the only risk is COVID-19, you lose the forest for the trees, ignoring every other possible threat.
Others are noticing. In a newly released article for ScienceDirect, three public health researchers take issue with the CDC’s guidance that masks be worn by all unvaccinated individuals, noting in particular the effects on young children over the age of 2.
“We feel that the CDC and Dr. (Anthony) Fauci have, by focusing exclusively on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, got this wrong,” they write, “and that this guidance is not good public health when the limited potential benefits of this policy are considered alongside the potential harms” (emphasis mine).
But the prevailing attitude looks more like this tweet from a prominent epidemiologist:
She tweets frequently about her struggles with anxiety — an understandable side effect of this level of constant vigilance and fear. But that is the the problem with viewing the pandemic solely through the lens of avoidance of a virus. We’ve been facing any number of public health emergencies in the past two years, and they’re not limited to COVID-19. We have an epidemic of drug overdoses, mental health crises and loneliness. All of these issues have serious and documented impacts on physical health.
In the face of a new variant, we still haven’t learned the lessons of Maslow’s hammer tunnel vision on COVID-19 and COVID-19 alone. Appearing on Sunday political shows, Fauci discussed the threat from the omicron variant, repeatedly warning we have to “prepare for the worst.” On ABC’s “This Week” he said, “You want to be prepared to do everything and anything.”
Is doing anything and everything in the face of a variant about which we know little — but what we do know indicates it’s not exactly a five-alarm fire — an appropriate public health response? Dr. Angelique Coetzee, a board member of the South African Medical Association and the professional who first identified the variant, told The Telegraph, “Their symptoms were so different and so mild from those I had treated before. … It presents mild disease with symptoms being sore muscles and tiredness for a day or two (and) not feeling well. So far, we have detected that those infected do not suffer the loss of taste or smell. They might have a slight cough. There are no prominent symptoms.”
Does this seem like an appropriate moment for the world to halt international travel, to discuss further lockdowns, to encourage hospitals to suspend elective surgeries and to reintroduce mandates? If you are singularly focused on COVID-19 and COVID-19 alone, you might think so, and as such, might be a hammer in search of a nail. It’s time to expand our roster of experts past those with expertise in virology and epidemiology and listen to those with a better grasp of the full public health picture.

Letitia Wright — who plays the character Shuri, who will reportedly become the new Black Panther in the wake of Chadwick Boseman’s untimely death — has chosen to not be vaccinated against the coronavirus, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
- Her decision came after making anti-science claims on social media. She was also injured on the set of the film, which caused a shutdown.
- But Wright, who is a British citizen, faces another major obstacle since she isn’t vaccinated against the coronavirus and lives in London.
Per guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, any noncitizen, nonimmigrant air traveler must show proof of full vaccination to fly into the United States.
- “Which means that, even if Disney could arrange an exemption to have her work on the film’s Atlanta-based main set, the question of how to get her there suddenly becomes an extremely pressing one,” per AV Club.
For now, it’s unclear how the film will resume production without a change in either the COVID-19 regulations, production setting or Wright’s vaccination status.
But the “Black Panther” sequel has already gone through big changes. ”Black Panther 2” star Lupita Nyong’o told Yahoo! that director Ryan Coogler changed the script in a major way once Boseman, who played T’Challa/Black Panther, died.
- “And his idea, the way which he has reshaped the second movie is so respectful of the loss we’ve all experienced as a cast and as a world. So it feels spiritually and emotionally correct to do this,” she said. “And hopefully, what I do look forward to, is getting back together and honoring what he started with us and holding his light through it. Because he left us a lot of light that we’re still going to be bathing in. I know that for sure.”",2021-11-11T19:00:00Z,2021,4,11
https://www.deseret.com/coronavirus/2021/12/26/22848099/omicron-variant-symptoms-similar-common-cold-covid-19/,Why omicron variant symptoms are so similar to common cold symptoms,Deseret News,2021-12-27T03:30:00Z,"The omicron variant of the coronavirus might have symptoms similar to the common cold because the new variant literally has a genetic code from the common cold inside of it.
Per Reuters, the omicron variant likely acquired a mutation — one of its more than 30 mutations, mind you — from a snippet of genetic material from the common cold. Meaning, yes, the omicron variant mutated to include parts of the common cold’s genetic makeup.
Researchers — who published a study in early December on OSF Preprints about this idea — found this after seeing genetic material in the common cold and the omicron variant.
- Venky Soundararajan, who works at the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based data analytics firm Nference and led the study, said this is why omicron has made itself look “more human.”
The small bit of the common cold inside of omicron “could mean the virus transmits more easily, while only causing mild or asymptomatic disease,” according to Reuters.
Professor Tim Spector, who helps run the ZOE COVID symptoms app that monitors COVID-19 cases and symptoms, recently said that the omicron variant can be hard to find because it does not lead to symptoms different than those you see in the common cold, according to The Independent, a U.K. news outlet.
- “Omicron is probably more, much more similar to the mild variants we’re seeing in people who have been vaccinated with Delta than anything else,” he said.
- “And so it is going to be producing cold-like symptoms that people won’t recognize as Covid if they just believe the official government advice.”
Researchers are still trying to figure out if the omicron variant creates more severe symptoms compared to other variants. Most indications suggest the variant does not lead to more severe illness. But there’s some early lab work that suggests the omicron variant can evade vaccines, boosters and natural immunity, raising questions about what we should expect next from the omicron variant.",2021-12-27T03:30:00Z,2021,4,11

“Each year, Utah’s talented youth participate in an extensive audition process for the chance to play a movement of a concerto on the Abravanel Hall stage with the Utah Symphony and join the ranks of the 380 Salute to Youth soloists who have come before them,” according to the Utah Symphony website.
The Salute to Youth concert, sponsored by the Deseret News and Utah Symphony, is an annual event that showcases the talent and dedication of young performers. Throughout the years, there are countless stories of young people putting off youth sports and group hangouts to practice their craft, all for the hope of performing before a large audience at Abravanel Hall.
“It’s always good to have big performance opportunities like this,” 18-year-old Mathew Lee told the Deseret News following his performance in 2019. “I’ve never soloed with a professional orchestra before, and it was a great experience.”
You could argue that the 2021 event is two years in the making. After all, the Utah Symphony canceled all of its events in March 2020 due to the coronavirus outbreak. It wasn't until September 2020 that the Utah Symphony opened again, bringing in shows and scheduling performances. The Salute to Youth concert often happens in September so it was not brought back for the 2020 schedule.
For the 60th Salute to Youth concert in 2019, nine musicians — who were selected from a total of 95 applicants — came together from all different stages of life to perform. But they all had the same goal: to showcase the power of music and perform with the Utah Symphony.
“Music has a really good impact on people’s minds and their ability to think,” said 18-year-old Gabrial Coombs in an interview with the Deseret News in 2019. “I love music, so I will always play throughout the rest of my life.”
The 2021 concert will be a little different than in previous years. For one, you’ll need a negative COVID-19 test or proof of vaccination to enter Abravanel Hall.
Here’s a rundown of what you can expect tonight from the show.
Who are the Salute to Youth artists for 2021?
Artists and programs are subject to change. But the Utah Symphony website has listed the following nine musicians as tonight’s guest artists:
- Conner Gray Covington conductor
- Eliza Hart, violin.
- Sarah Kendell, violin.
- Emma Phippen, harp.
- Sabrina Allen, piano.
- Jill Smith, piano.
- Stella Wadsworth, cello.
- Alina Baron, violin.
- Ezekiel Sokoloff, violin.
- Ellen Hayashi, violin.
Do you need a COVID-19 test to attend?
Proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test will be required for performance entry on Tuesday night, according to the Utah Symphony website.

https://www.deseret.com/coronavirus/2021/12/24/22846901/face-masks-protect-omicron-variant-what-to-know/,Do masks protect you from the omicron variant? Here’s what we know,Deseret News,2021-12-24T15:00:00Z,"Face masks have long been considered a way to slow the spread of the coronavirus. But do face masks stop the new omicron variant of the virus?
Masks are an effective way to reduce the risk of contracting and spreading the coronavirus, experts said. Masks often act as barriers that traps virus particles from slipping through and infecting others.
- However. masks are imperfect, meaning some virus particles can slip through.
Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of health policy and infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said face masks might not be as effective at stopping the omicron variant.
- “Omicron produces more virus, even than delta,” Schaffner told Health. “So, the masks’ capacity to interrupt or reduce transmission back and forth is likewise reduced.”
Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told ABC News last week that face masks won’t be around forever. While the CDC is encouraging people to wear them now, it’s unlikely masks will last forever.
- “Masks are for now, they’re not forever,” Walensky told ABC News. “We have to find a way to be done with them.”
Walensky said the best way to end the use of face masks is to embrace the current strategies of fighting COVID-19, like the vaccine and following public health guidances.
- “Science is hard in a two-minute soundbite,” she said. “Know that every single decision — as hard as they are — have been grounded in science.”",2021-12-24T15:00:00Z,2021,4,11

At the beginning of 2020, very few people grasped the significance of the news coming out of Wuhan about a new coronavirus. When I first spoke and wrote publicly about the rising probability of a global pandemic, in the week ending Jan. 26, 2020, I was regarded as eccentric (certainly by the majority of the delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos, who seemed oblivious to the danger). The conventional wisdom at that time, from Fox News to The Washington Post, was that the coronavirus posed a lesser threat to Americans than the usual winter wave of influenza.
On Feb. 2, I wrote, “We are now dealing with an epidemic in the world’s most populous country, which has a significant chance of becoming a global pandemic. ... The challenge is ... to resist that strange fatalism that leads most of us not to cancel our travel plans and not to wear uncomfortable masks, even when a dangerous virus is spreading exponentially.”
Looking back, I read those sentences as a veiled confession.
I was traveling manically in January and February, as I had done for most of the previous 20 years. In January, I flew from London to Dallas, from Dallas to San Francisco, and from there to Hong Kong (Jan. 8), Taipei (Jan. 10), Singapore (Jan. 13), Zurich (Jan. 19), back to San Francisco (Jan. 24), and then to Fort Lauderdale (Jan. 27). I wore a mask once or twice but found it intolerable after an hour and took it off.
In the course of February, I flew almost as frequently, though not so far: to New York, Sun Valley, Bozeman, Washington and Lyford Cay in the Bahamas. You may wonder what kind of life that was. I used to joke that the lecture circuit had turned me into an “international man of history.” I realized only later that I might have been one of the “superspreaders” whose hyperactive travel schedules were spreading the virus from Asia to the rest of the world.
My weekly newspaper column in the first half of 2020 became a kind of plague diary, though I never mentioned the fact that I was ill for most of February, with a painful cough I could not shake off. (To get through lectures, I relied heavily on the alternative medicine that some call Scotch.)
“Worry about grandparents,” I wrote on Feb. 29; “the mortality rate for people in their eighties is above 14%, whereas it’s close to zero for those under 40.” I omitted the less comforting data on asthmatic men in their mid-50s. I also left out the fact that I went to see a doctor twice only to be told that — as more or less everywhere in the United States at that time — there were no tests available for COVID-19. All I knew was that it was serious, and not only for me and my family.
As I wrote on March 1: “Those who blithely say, ‘This is no worse than the flu’ ... are missing the point. ... Uncertainty surrounds it because it is so difficult to detect in its early stages, when many carriers are both infectious and asymptomatic. We don’t know for sure how many people have it, so we don’t exactly know its reproduction number and its mortality rate. There’s no vaccine and there’s no cure.”
In another article, published in The Wall Street Journal on March 8, I wrote, “If the U.S. turns out to have proportionately as many cases as South Korea, it will soon have some 46,000 cases and more than 300 deaths — or 1,200 deaths if the U.S. mortality rate is as high as Italy’s.”
At that point, total confirmed cases in the U.S. stood at just 541; deaths at 22. We passed 46,000 cases on March 24 and 1,200 deaths on March 25, just over two weeks later. On March 15, I noted, “John F. Kennedy airport was thronged yesterday with people doing what, since time immemorial, they have done in times of plague: fleeing the big city (and spreading the virus). ... We are entering the panic phase of the pandemic.”
That was the same day I myself flew, with my wife and my two youngest children, from California to Montana. We stayed there for a year.
I wrote and thought about little else in the first half of 2020. Why this intense preoccupation? The answer is that, although my core competency is financial history, I have been keenly interested in the role of disease in history ever since studying the Hamburg cholera epidemic of 1892 as a graduate student more than 30 years ago. Richard Evans’ meticulously detailed study of that episode introduced me to the idea that the mortality caused by a deadly pathogen is partly a reflection of the social and political order it attacks. It was the class structure as much as the bacterium Vibrio cholerae that killed people in Hamburg, Germany, Evans argued, because the entrenched power of the city’s property owners had been an insuperable obstacle to improving the city’s antiquated water and sewage systems. The mortality rate for the poor was 13 times higher than for the rich.
Researching “The Pity of War” a few years later, I was struck by statistics that suggested the German army had collapsed in 1918 partly because of a surge of illness, possibly resulting from the Spanish influenza pandemic. “The War of the World” (Penguin, 2006) delved more deeply into the history of the 1918-19 pandemic, showing how the First World War ended with twin pandemics — not only influenza but also the ideological contagion of Bolshevism.
The work I did on empires in the 2000s also involved excursions into the history of contagious disease. No account of European settlement in the New World could have omitted the role that disease played in “thinning the Indians, to make room for the English,” as John Archdale, the governor of Carolina in the 1690s, callously remarked. (The title of the second chapter of my book “Empire” was “White Plague.”)
I was also very struck by the terrible toll of tropical disease on British soldiers stationed far from home: A man’s chances of surviving a tour of duty in Sierra Leone were pitifully low — 1 in 2. “The Great Degeneration” (Penguin, 2014) explicitly warned of our growing vulnerability to “the ... random mutation of viruses like influenza,” while “The Square and the Tower” (Penguin, 2017) was essentially a history of the world based on the insight that “network structures are as important as viruses in determining the speed and extent of a contagion.”
The COVID-19 pandemic is far from over. The death toll worldwide approaches five million, which is certainly an underestimate, as the statistics from a number of large countries (notably Iran and Russia) cannot be trusted. And the cumulative body count continues to rise globally — to say nothing of the number of people whose health has been permanently damaged, which no one has yet estimated. It seems increasingly likely that Lord Martin Rees, Britain’s astronomer royal, has won his bet with the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker that “bioterror or bioerror will lead to one million casualties in a single event within a six month period starting no later than Dec 31 2020.”
Some epidemiologists have argued that, without drastic social distancing and economic lockdowns, the ultimate death toll could have been between 30 million and 40 million. Because of government restrictions and changes in public behavior, it will surely not be as high.
Yet precisely these “nonpharmaceutical interventions” have inflicted a shock on the world economy far greater than that caused by the 2008-09 financial crisis — potentially as great as the shock of the Great Depression, but compressed into months, not years. Governments had to take drastic fiscal measures to stave off a collapse of the markets.
You see, disasters and their impact are rarely entirely exogenous events, with the exception of a massive meteor strike, which hasn’t happened in 66 million years, or an alien invasion, which hasn’t happened at all. Even a catastrophic earthquake is only as catastrophic as the extent of urbanization along the fault line — or the shoreline, if it triggers a tsunami.
A pandemic is made up of a new pathogen and the social networks that it attacks. We cannot understand the scale of the contagion by studying only the virus itself, because the virus will infect only as many people as social networks allow it to. At the same time, a catastrophe lays bare the societies and states that it strikes. It is a moment of truth, of revelation, exposing some as fragile, others as resilient, and others as “antifragile” — able not just to withstand disaster but to be strengthened by it.
We still find ourselves in the middle of this pandemic, about which it’s hard to gain the perspective that hindsight affords. But looking at past pandemics and disasters not only helps provide perspective on the current one, but also allow us to understand and prepare for the inevitability of the next one.
So cometh now
My Lady Influenza, like a star
Inebriously wan, and in her train
Fever, the haggard soul’s white nenuphur,
And lily-fingered Death, and grisly Pain
And Constipation who makes all things vain,
Pneumonyer, Cancer, and Nasal Catarrh.
Rupert Brooke’s “To My Lady Influenza” (1906) was a facetious undergraduate work. Yet “Lady Influenza” was never to be trifled with. The first well-described influenza outbreaks were in 16th-century Europe, but the earliest was probably in 1173.
There had been significant influenza pandemics in the 18th and 19th centuries, but the 20th century was to be hit much harder. A more populous world was also a more urban world and a more mobile world — a world in which low air quality in industrial towns may have made people more susceptible to respiratory illnesses. A year after Brooke wrote “To My Lady Influenza,” his eldest brother, Dick, died of pneumonia at the age of 26. Brooke himself would live only a year longer, dying of an infected mosquito bite that led to sepsis, off the Greek island of Skyros.
A predictable “gray rhino,” in the sense that danger of a general European war was well known, but also a surprising “black swan,” in the sense that contemporaries seemed bewildered by its outbreak, the First World War was a true dragon-king event in terms of its vast historical consequences.
As disastrous as the war was, its proximate impact in terms of lives lost was exceeded by that of the influenza pandemic that broke out in its final year. Where exactly the new strain of H1N1 first appeared is uncertain, but it is usually said to have been Fort Riley, Kansas, the site of Camp Funston, one of the network of Army camps where hundreds of thousands of young American men were being trained to fight in Europe as the American Expeditionary Forces. There is, however, evidence that the pandemic originated in the British Army in 1917, though the condition was initially identified as “purulent bronchitis with bronchopneumonia.”
Here was the key to influenza’s 20th-century success. Never had armies been mobilized on such a scale before — more than 70 million men in uniform. Never had so many young men been taken from their homes and workplaces, crowded into primitive accommodations, and sent over long distances in ships and trains. The idea that the virus originated in pigs has been refuted (an avian origin seems more likely); if anything, the direction of infection was from men to pigs.
The first American cases were recorded at Camp Funston on March 4. A week later, a member of Fort Riley’s catering staff entered the infirmary, followed in the coming days by a stream of infected soldiers. By the end of the month, more than a thousand cases had been recorded and 48 men had died of influenza.
As if to mock the efforts of men to kill one another, the virus spread rapidly across the United States and then crossed to Europe on the jam-packed American troopships. It is possible that the pandemic explains the near doubling of the proportion of German soldiers reporting sick in the summer of 1918, which was a crucial factor in the imperial army’s subsequent collapse. Certainly, we have reports of German prisoners of war with the flu from July. By that time it had reached India, Australia and New Zealand. A few months later, a second and deadlier wave struck all but simultaneously in Brest, France; Freetown, Sierra Leone; and Boston.
The virus made a new landfall in the United States at Boston’s Commonwealth Pier on Aug. 27, 1918, when three cases of influenza appeared on the sick list. Eight cases emerged the next day, and 58 the next, 15 of whom were so ill they were transferred to the U.S. Naval Hospital in Chelsea.
On Sept. 8, influenza arrived at the Army’s Camp Devens. Within 10 days, thousands of feverish patients overwhelmed the camp’s hospitals; within weeks, the morgue was full of blue-tinged, asphyxiated corpses.
Combatant countries sought to suppress the news of the pandemic as potentially harmful to wartime morale; this hardly helped to keep the public informed. The disease came to be known as the Spanish flu because only the largely uncensored press of neutral Spain reported on it with any accuracy.
Between 40 million and 50 million people died as a result of the pandemic, the majority of them suffocated by a lethal accumulation of blood and other fluid in the lungs.
The absolute numbers were highest in India (18.5 million deaths) and China (between 4 million and 9.5 million), but death rates varied widely from place to place. Close to half (44.5%) of the population of Cameroon was wiped out; in Western Samoa, nearly a quarter (23.6%). The worst mortality rates in Europe were in Hungary and Spain (each around 1.2%), with Italy not far behind. By contrast, North America got off lightly: between 0.53% and 0.65% for the United States, 0.61% for Canada.
As these figures imply, the Spanish flu was indifferent as to a country’s combatant status. While its initial spread may have been related to wartime accommodation and transportation, that soon ceased to be true.
In the United States, the deaths of as many as 675,000 people were attributed to the Spanish flu, of which 550,000 were excess deaths (above what would have been expected in that period under normal circumstances). Equivalent mortality in 2020 would have been between 1.8 million and 2.2 million Americans. The Spanish flu killed an order of magnitude more Americans than died in combat in the war (53,402).
Ironically, unlike most flu epidemics, but like the war that preceded and spread it, the influenza of 1918 disproportionately killed young adults. Out of 272,500 male influenza deaths in the United States, nearly 49% were aged 20 to 39, whereas only 18% were under five and 13% were over 50. The very young and very old were also (as usual) vulnerable, so that all countries for which age-specific death rates are available recorded a roughly W-shaped age distribution of mortality. Death was not caused by the influenza virus itself so much as by the body’s immunological reaction to the virus.
Perversely, this meant that individuals with the strongest immune systems were more likely to die than those with weaker immune systems. A good illustration of the impact of the pandemic on young adults, as well as a vivid description of the hallucinogenic miseries of the illness itself, can be found in Katherine Anne Porter’s short story “Pale Horse, Pale Rider” (1937), about a wartime romance cut cruelly short by the virus.
In Sept. 2021, COVID-19’s American death toll overtook that of the 1918 flu. And yet, in Aug. 2020, it appeared that, with a regime of mass testing, contact tracing, social distancing and targeted quarantining, a country could contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as the virus relied heavily on superspreaders for its transmission and disproportionately sickened or killed people past retirement age. Only in the spring of 2021 did it join the elite of pandemics — the 20 or so in recorded history that killed upward of 0.05% of humanity.
Only a handful of those nations that fought World War II have lost more people per day to COVID-19 than they have lost to the Axis powers. The United States is one of those countries. This illustrates something profound — that all disasters are at some level man-made political disasters, even if they originate with new pathogens.
Politics explained why World War II killed 25 times as many Germans as Americans. Politics also helps to explain why COVID-19 has thus far killed more than eight times as many Americans as Germans.
This plague began as a gray rhino, predicted by many. It struck as a black swan, somehow completely unforeseen. Could it become a world-changing “dragon king”?
As we have seen, disasters of any kind become truly epoch-making events only if their economic, social and political ramifications amount to more than the excess mortality they cause. Could this medium-size disaster nevertheless alter our lives permanently and profoundly? Let me now hazard three guesses.
First, COVID-19 will be to social life what AIDS was to sexual life: It will change our behavior, though by no means enough to avert a significant number of premature deaths. I myself welcome a new age of social distancing, but then I am a natural misanthrope who hates crowds and will not greatly miss hugs and handshakes. Most people, however, will be unable to resist the temptations of post-lockdown gregariousness. There will be unsafe socializing just as there still is unsafe sex, even after more than three decades and 30 million deaths from HIV.
Second, and for that reason, most big cities are not “over.” Do we all now head from Gotham or the Great Wen to the villages, there to cultivate our vegetable gardens in splendid, rustic isolation? Do nearly half of us continue to work from home, as we did during the pandemic — more than three times more than before? Probably not.
It takes a lot to kill a city. True, just over a century after Thomas Mann wrote “Death in Venice” (1912), Venice is pretty much dead. But it was not cholera that killed it — it was the shifting pattern of international trade. Likewise, COVID-19 will not kill London or New York; it will just make them cheaper, grungier and younger. Some billionaires will not return. Some firms and many families will move to the suburbs or even farther afield. Tax revenues will drop. Crime rates will jump. As Gerald Ford supposedly did in 1975, when the city asked for a federal bailout, another president may tell New York to “drop dead.” San Francisco will lose talent to Austin.
But inertia is a powerful thing. Americans these days relocate less than they used to. Only a third of jobs can really be done at home; everyone else will still need to work in offices, shops and factories. Workplaces will just be different — more spacious and campus-like, as they already are in Silicon Valley. Commuting will no longer involve being packed like sardines on a subway. No more unwelcome intimacies on elevators. Masks over most faces. No more tut-tutting at the hijab and the niqab. Perforce, we are all modest now.
What of the pandemic’s impact on the generational imbalances that had grown so intolerable in many societies by 2020? Was COVID-19 sent by Freya, the goddess of youth, to emancipate millennials and Generation Z from bearing the fiscal burden of an excessive number of elderly people?
It is tempting to marvel at this ageist virus. No previous pandemic was so discriminating against the elderly and in favor of the young. But in truth, the impact of COVID-19 in terms of excess mortality will probably not be great enough to balance the intergenerational accounts. In the short run, the majority of old people will remain retired; relatively few will die prematurely — hardly any in the most elderly of countries, Japan.
The young, meanwhile, will be the ones struggling to find jobs (other than with Amazon) and struggling almost as much to have fun. An economy without crowds is not a “new normal.” It may be more like the new anomie, to borrow Émile Durkheim’s term for the sense of disconnectedness he associated with",2021-10-26T04:00:00Z,2021,4,11
https://www.deseret.com/coronavirus/2021/12/20/22846279/dr-fauci-omicron-variant-deaths-hospitalizations/,Dr. Fauci predicts how the omicron variant will hit the United States,Deseret News,2021-12-20T19:00:00Z,"The omicron variant of the novel coronavirus will lead to new peaks of cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the U.S., Dr. Anthony Fauci predicted over the weekend.
Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was asked what he expects to see from the omicron variant, specifically if the U.S. could see record case numbers, as well as record hospitalizations and deaths.
- “Yes, well, unfortunately, I think that that is going to happen,” he said on CNN.
- He added: “We are going to see a significant stress in some regions of the country on the hospital system, particularly in those areas where you have a low level of vaccination, which is one of the reasons why we continue to stress the importance of getting those unvaccinated people vaccinated.”
Fauci has been pushing for people across the country to get their COVID-19 vaccine booster shots to increase their protection against omicron, according to The Associated Press.
- “The idea about hoping and having an aspiration to be independent of the virus after a period of time is understandable and reasonable,” Fauci said. “But the one thing that we know from, now, almost two years’ experience with this virus is that it is really very unpredictable.”
Indeed, a new model from United Kingdom researchers found that the COVID-19 booster shot could provide about 85% more protection against severe COVID-19 symptoms from the omicron variant, according to BBC News. The researchers used a modeling system to determine how well boosters could fight omicron.
- “One remaining uncertainty is how severe the disease caused by the omicron variant is compared to disease caused by previous variants,” said Azra Ghani, a professor and researcher at Imperial College. “Whilst it may take several weeks to fully understand this, governments will need to put in place plans now to mitigate any potential impact. Our results demonstrate the importance of delivering booster doses as part of the wider public health response.”",2021-12-20T19:00:00Z,2021,4,11

The Cougars have ranked No. 48 or better in the final Learfield IMG College Directors’ Cup standings since their inception in 1993, and last July they finished No. 17, their highest ranking since 2000–01.
BYU is headed toward another top-25 finish when the current academic year ends next July.
Clearly, something special is going on in Provo these days. It’s good to be BYU athletic director Tom Holmoe, the architect of the program that manages, on a whole, to overachieve on an annual basis, given that it doesn’t enjoy the type of funding that many Power Five programs do.
Of course, BYU’s status as a non-Power Five athletic program will change in 2023, as the Provo school sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints enters the Big 12. More on that later.
For BYU athletics, these truly are the glory days — particularly for the Olympic sports, women’s sports and in individual championships. Cougars are climbing on the podium in individual events like never before.
BYU has tasted greatness from its sports teams before — the 1984 national championship and the 1996 Cotton Bowl win in football come to mind, as well as national titles in men’s volleyball (twice) multiple national crowns in men’s and women’s cross-country, a men’s golf championship in 1981, a piece of the national championship in men’s track and field in 1970 and NIT men’s basketball championships in 1951 and 1966 when that tournament was viewed more highly than the NCAA Tournament.
But rarely has almost every team on campus been as successful as they are now, evidenced by the “no-loss November” when BYU’s teams combined to go 29-0 last month and Cougars Whittni Orton and Conner Mantz swept the individual titles at the 2021 NCAA Cross-Country Championships.
In short, 2021 will go down as one of the most significant and successful years in BYU sports history — on and off the fields and courts of play.
Here’s the Deseret News’ look at the 10 biggest stories of the year for BYU sports.
BYU accepts Big 12 invite
In the words of Holmoe, “the stars aligned and it all came together” on Sept. 10, the day BYU was admitted into the Big 12. Years, even decades, of hard work finally paid off, and the Cougars, an independent in football and a member of the West Coast Conference in most other sports, will join Group of Five schools Cincinnati, UCF and Houston in the Power Five league in 2023.
“This would not have happened without Tom Holmoe,” BYU President Kevin Worthen said.
The Big 12 invite stands as not only the most newsworthy BYU sports development in 2021, but perhaps the last decade — at least since BYU announced in 2010 it was going independent in football and joining the WCC in basketball, etc., the following year.
Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby said the Cougars were an outstanding candidate in 2016 when the league considered expanding, then decided against it, and that the Big 12 never forgot about BYU’s “impressive following” and worldwide fanbase. He called it a “long-awaited marriage” between the Cougars and the conference that will see Texas and Oklahoma eventually depart for the SEC.
BYU posts another double-digit win season, but loses bowl
Sure, the Cougars’ disappointing 31-28 loss to UAB amid driving rain and heavy winds in the Independence Bowl left a lot of fans with a sour taste in their mouths. But they shouldn’t forget that very few people predicted a 10-win season for the Cougars in what was supposed to be a rebuilding year with a new starting quarterback and the loss of more than a dozen other graduating starters.
After BYU improved to 5-0 with a 34-20 victory over eventual Mountain West champion and LA Bowl winner Utah State, the Cougars were ranked No. 10 in both The Associated Press and USA Today Coaches polls, almost matching their highest ranking in 2020 when they went 9-0 and were as high as No. 8 in one poll before falling at Coastal Carolina.
The Cougars fell 26-17 to Boise State and 38-24 to Big 12 champion Baylor before recovering nicely with five straight wins despite a plethora of injuries to key players on both sides of the ball before their lackluster performance in Shreveport, Louisiana, which will probably cost them a second-straight top-15 ranking in the final national polls.
Wilson becomes highest Cougar ever taken in NFL draft
Superstar quarterback Zach Wilson’s emergence was arguably BYU’s No. 1 sports story in 2020, along with the Cougars’ 11-1 finish. But the product of Draper’s Corner Canyon High was taken No. 2 overall by the New York Jets in the NFL draft on April 29, 2021, in Cleveland, making that development not only one of the biggest stories for BYU sports, but the state of Utah as a whole, this past year.
Wilson’s story threw BYU football into the national spotlight, as the fresh-faced kid from the Salt Lake City suburb 20 minutes away from Utah’s capital city walked down the runway at a makeshift stage and hugged vaccinated NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, donned a Jets ball cap, slapped hands with Jets fans and told them the Jets “are going to be a special team, baby” and that they were “going to the Super Bowl.”
Flanked by his family, his girlfriend Abbey Gile, Corner Canyon coach Eric Kjar, BYU coaches Kalani Sitake, Fesi Sitake and Aaron Roderick and quarterbacks coach John Beck, Wilson told the Deseret News that night that it took dozens of people to get him to that point in his life.
“I’ll never not be grateful for them,” he said.
Sitake signs ‘unprecedented’ contract through 2027
After Sitake’s name popped up as a candidate for head coaching openings at USC, Washington and Oregon, among other schools, BYU signed the six-year coach to a “new, unprecedented” contract on Dec. 10 that should keep him in Provo through 2027.
Although financial terms were not disclosed (and probably never will be), Sitake said in a Zoom meeting that day that the entire program — from the players to his assistant coaches to support staff and office personnel — would benefit, which is what makes it unprecedented in his view.
“When we talk about unprecedented, it is about what we can do at BYU,” Holmoe said.
Added Sitake: “This is about getting our players the opportunities and the resources they need, and that is why, in my opinion, the unprecedented part of it involves more than just me.”
The announcement came a few days after the Oregonian reported that Sitake had interviewed for the Oregon vacancy. The Deseret News reported that Oregon officials did a Zoom call with Sitake on Dec. 7, and Sitake never made a visit to Eugene for an in-person interview.
Men’s team makes NCAA tourney for first time in six years
After the pandemic forced the cancellation of the 2020 NCAA Tournament and prematurely ended coach Mark Pope’s first season in Provo (the Cougars almost certainly would have received an at-large invitation to the Big Dance), BYU’s men’s basketball team didn’t let the loss of Yoeli Childs, Jake Toolson, Zac Seljaas and T.J. Haws keep it from getting to the tournament for the first time in six years in 2021.
BYU went into the Big Dance with a 20-6 record and a No. 6 seed, but drew No. 11 seed UCLA and historic Hinkle Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Indiana — where the entire tournament was played — and struggled against the Pac-12’s Bruins from almost the opening tip.
Johnny Juzang scored 27 points and UCLA won, 73-62, to eliminate the Cougars before making it all the way to the Final Four, where the Bruins lost 93-90 to Gonzaga in the national semifinals.
Star senior guard Alex Barcello returned for another season in Provo, a noteworthy development in and of itself, and the Cougars picked up in November where they left off last spring. They beat San Diego State 66-60 in Provo, upset No. 12 Oregon 81-49 in Portland and downed rival Utah 75-64 in Salt Lake City and were 9-2 heading into the Diamond Head Classic in Hawaii and being projected as a No. 7 seed by Joe Lunardi’s Bracketology.
Cross-country teams maintain status as elite powerhouse
On March 15, BYU’s Conner Mantz won the men’s individual title at the NCAA Cross-Country Championships and coach Diljeet Taylor led the BYU women to the team championship in Stillwater, Oklahoma. The championships came after the 2020 season was delayed due to the pandemic.
For the winning Cougars, Anna Camp (11th), Aubrey Frentheway (15th), Whittni Orton (17th, Sara Musselman (33rd) and McKenna Lee (41st) contributed to the team title. BYU won by 65 points, the largest margin of victory in the championships since 2012.
“It was a total team effort,” Taylor said. “I’m speechless.”
Eight months and a few days later, BYU was shut out of the team titles in the 2021 NCAA Cross-Country Championships on Nov. 20 in Tallahassee, Florida, but swept the individual titles.
Mantz won the men’s title for the second time in the calendar year, while Orton claimed her first national championship in the final race of her star-crossed BYU career.
It was only the second time in NCAA history that the winners were from the same school, matching an Indiana feat in 1988.
“It was a wild moment, for sure,” Orton told ESPN.
BYU’s women finished second as a team, slightly behind North Carolina State, while the BYU men finished seventh for the second straight championships.
It should also be noted that BYU’s Camp won the NCAA 1,500 meters national championship on June 12 in Eugene, Oregon, with a school record-breaking time of 4:08.53.
Cinderella BYU plays in NCAA women’s soccer title game
Led by All-Americans Mikayla Colohan and Cameron Tucker, No. 4 seed BYU made it all the way to the championship game in the NCAA Women’s Soccer Championships before falling in penalty kicks to No. 1 overall seed Florida State.
After neither team was able to score in regulation or overtime in Santa Clara, California, the Seminoles won the shootout 4-3 to win their fourth national title on Dec. 6. The Cougars had advanced to the Final Four for the first time in the 27-year history of their program, and knocked off Santa Clara in penalty kicks in a semifinal.
“We had a phenomenal year,” said BYU coach Jennifer Rockwood, the only coach in the history of the program. “We are just really proud of the way we competed tonight, the way we represented ourselves and our school and our conference.”
Having tied Santa Clara for the WCC championship, the Cougars finished the season 18-5-1.
BYU snaps 9-game losing skid to Utah, goes 5-0 vs. Pac-12
The Cougars’ football exploits in 2021 have already been mentioned, but this achievement deserves its own designation. A day after the BYU-to-Big 12 announcement, the Cougars made sure it was a weekend to remember with a 26-17 win over the Utes in front of a sellout crowd at LaVell Edwards Stadium.
Joyous BYU fans, thousands of them, stormed the field to celebrate the Cougars’ first win over the Utes since 2009. The win became even more impressive when Utah won the Pac-12 championship to advance to its first Rose Bowl game.
But BYU didn’t just stop there. Having defeated Arizona in their opener in Las Vegas, the Cougars went on to defeat Arizona State, Washington State and USC to go 5-0 against Pac-12 teams. The Cougars also defeated Bronco Mendenhall-led Virginia (before the former BYU coach resigned on Dec. 2 in Charlottesville) to finish with six wins over Power Five schools, the most P5 wins in a season in school history.
Men’s volleyball advances to national championship match
After it sparkling 2020 season was cut short by COVID-19, BYU’s men’s volleyball team picked up where it left off in 2021 with another stellar season. Led by star outside hitter Gabi Garcia Fernandez and a host of other talented players, the Cougars defeated Lewis in a national semifinal match in Columbus, Ohio, to advance to the final against No. 1 Hawaii.
However, the No. 2 Cougars came out flat in the championship match, and were swept by the Warriors 3-0 to finish their season at 20-4.
After having won the national championship in 2004, BYU has now lost 12 straight sets in national title clashes, falling to UC Irvine, Ohio State (twice) and Hawaii.
Coach Shawn Olmstead called the year one of the toughest of his career, but also “probably the most rewarding” as well.
Women’s basketball team makes March Madness run
Coach Jeff Judkins’ Cougars went undefeated (9-0) at home and finished with a 19-6 record last spring. After upsetting Rutgers 69-66 in a 2021 NCAA Tournament game, the Cougars led eventual runner-up Arizona with five minutes remaining but lost the lead and the game, 52-46.
With star guards Paisley Harding and Shaylee Gonzales returning, the Cougars (9-1) are off to another strong start and were ranked No. 19 in the country the week before Christmas.
They beat Pac-12 schools Utah, Arizona State and Washington State in nonconference play and also won the St. Pete Showcase in Florida, downing No. 17 Florida State and No. 22 West Virginia to claim that title.
All told, it has been a phenomenal fall for BYU’s women’s teams, as soccer made it to the College Cup championship match and women’s volleyball went 30-2 and advanced to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament for the ninth time in 10 seasons.
The Cougars went 18-0 in league play to win the WCC championship and downed Boise State and Utah in the NCAA Tournament before losing a five-set heartbreaker to No. 6 Purdue in Pittsburgh on Dec. 9.",2021-12-28T19:47:33Z,2021,4,11
https://www.deseret.com/coronavirus/2021/11/29/22807534/omicron-variant-dr-fauci-covid-cases-us/,Dr. Fauci says the omicron variant is coming to the U.S.,Deseret News,2021-11-29T17:45:00Z,"The new omicron coronavirus variant will reach the United State soon enough, said Dr. Anthony Fauci in an interview Sunday.
Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week” that the omicron variant will “inevitably” hit the U.S.
- “We all know when you have a virus that has already gone to multiple countries, inevitably it will be here,” he said. “The question is, will we be prepared for it?”
Fauci said people can prepare themselves for the omicron variant’s arrival by getting vaccinated since the vaccine will likely work to stop severe outcomes.
- “We are on the lookout for this. The CDC has a good surveillance system,” Fauci said. “So, if and when — and it is going to be when — it comes here, hopefully, we will be ready for it by enhancing our capabilities via the vaccine, masking, all the things that we do and should be doing.”
In a similar move, Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, told CNN on Sunday that getting the vaccine is your best bet to stay safe from the new variant.
- “We have to use every kind of tool in our toolbox to keep (omicron) from getting in a situation that makes this worse,” he said.

Collins said mitigation efforts are needed, too, to stop the spread of the variant.
- “It also means we need to pay attention to those mitigation strategies that people are just really sick of, like wearing masks while indoors with other people who might not be vaccinated and keeping that social distance issue,” he added. “I know, America — you’re really tired of hearing those things. But the virus is not tired of us. And it’s shapeshifting itself.”",2021-11-29T17:45:00Z,2021,4,11
https://www.deseret.com/coronavirus/2021/12/16/22839397/moderna-less-effective-omicron-symptoms-two-doses/,Is Moderna less effective against omicron?,Deseret News,2021-12-17T03:30:00Z,"Two doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine may be less effective at stopping the omicron variant, according to new research.
The study — which has not been peer-reviewed — analyzed 30 blood samples from patients who were double vaccinated with two Moderna shots, according to The Hill. Researchers then tested the vaccine against a pseudovirus version of the omicron strain.
- Scientists found antibodies from two Moderna shots were 50% less effective at stopping the omicron strain.
- This “could lead to an increased risk of symptomatic breakthrough infections,” the researchers said, per The Hill.
However, 12 participants who received a Moderna booster shot had a 12-fold improvement in stopping omicron, as the booster reduced the risk of the new variant.
So far, research suggests the omicron variant causes less severe symptoms among vaccinated infected patients. Per The Washington Post, a new study found the variant can evade vaccines, but will often cause mild symptoms when it does.
Experts are still worried about the variant’s potential spread, even to those who are vaccinated.
- “Even if it causes only mild disease — and that’s far from certain — that could still mean many people end up in the hospital and dying,” according to CNN.
That’s why Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House medical adviser on the coronavirus, said booster shots are wildly important to staying safe from omicron, per CNBC.
- “Our booster vaccine regimens work against omicron,” Fauci said at a White House COVID-19 update Wednesday. “At this point, there is no need for a variant-specific booster.”",2021-12-17T03:30:00Z,2021,4,11

Per The Los Angeles Times, California health officials recently said that there has been a jump in child hospitalizations from COVID-19 in New York, where the omicron wave has been hitting.
- “Unfortunately NY is seeing an increase in pediatric hospitalizations (primarily amongst the unvaccinated), and they have similar (5- to 11-year-old) vaccination rates,” Dr. Erica Pan, the California state epidemiologist, wrote on Twitter this week. “Please give your children the gift of vaccine protection as soon as possible as our case (numbers) are increasing rapidly.”
So far, half the children admitted to hospitals are younger than 5, meaning they can’t be vaccinated against COVID-19 yet, according to The Los Angeles Times.
- About 75% of 12- to 15-year-olds who were admitted were not fully vaccinated.
- About 100% of those 5 to 11 years old were not fully vaccinated.
Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist and health economist, said that New York City saw a “4-fold” increase in pediatric hospital COVID-19 admissions during the week of Dec. 19 compared to Dec. 5 — which is about when the omicron variant started to hit the United States.
In the days after the omicron variant was first discovered, The Daily Beast reported that the highly transmissible omicron variant sent huge numbers of unvaccinated children — who were younger than 5 years old — to the hospital in South Africa.
- “The trend that we’re seeing now, that is different to what we’ve seen before, is a particular increase in hospital admissions in children under 5 years,” said Waasila Jassat, a South African government adviser, according to The Daily Beast.
- “We’ve always seen children not being very heavily affected by the COVID epidemic in the past, not having many admissions. In the third wave, we saw more admissions in young children under 5 and in teenagers, 15-19, and now, at the start of this fourth wave, we have seen quite a sharp increase across all age groups, but particularly in the under 5s.”",2021-12-28T00:00:00Z,2021,4,11

Use the ‘2 out of 3’ rule, expert says",Deseret News,2021-12-22T12:00:00Z,"The holidays are here again and the United States has found itself in a new scenario with the coronavirus — the omicron variant has become the new dominant strain in the United States, spreading quicker and faster through the population.
- So, with the holidays right around the corner, should you skip your holiday party? Should you cancel your trip to see your family?
Not yet, according to Dr. Leana Wen, a professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health.
- Wen told CNN that people should not cancel their holiday plans yet. However, “I do think it’s prudent to re-evaluate them and make a risk-benefit calculation based on each family’s circumstance,” she said.
Wen said people should use the “two out of three” rule. When you’re spending time indoors, where the virus is circulating, consider having two out of three major layers of protection. Those three layers are:
- Vaccination.
- COVID-19 testing.
- Masking.
- So, for example, you can be vaccinated and wear a mask indoors. Or you can get a vaccination and take a rapid COVID-19 test before you see your family.
“If you want to go to an indoor gathering where people are eating and drinking — and therefore unmasked — and it’s an area with high viral spread, you need proof of vaccination and same-day testing,” she said.
There’s more you can do to stay safe from the omicron variant. CBS News’ chief medical correspondent Dr. Jonathan LaPook offered six different tips to keep you safe from omicron symptoms over the holidays, including:
- Getting the COVID-19 vaccine.
- Wearing a mask.
- Social distancing from others.
- Washing your hands all the time.
- Taking COVID-19 tests when you’re worried about infection.
- Improve ventilation in indoors spaces.
But don’t get it twisted — some experts are changing their plans. For example, Bronwyn MacInnis, director of pathogen genomic surveillance at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard University, said last week that the American people may want to consider their wintertime merriment, according to USA Today.
- “Personally, I’m reevaluating plans for the holidays,” MacInnis told reporters, according to USA Today. ”It’s the responsible thing to do and what feels right given the risk.”",2021-12-22T12:00:00Z,2021,4,11

Driving the news: Bourla said that the COVID-19 vaccine may become a yearly shot that is needed to ward off new COVID-19 variants that emerge.
What they’re saying: “It is necessary,” he said.
- “Variants are coming and Omicron was the first one ... but also we know that the duration of the protection doesn’t last very long,” he said.
- “So what we are trying to do, and we’re working very diligently right now, it is to make not only a vaccine that will protect against all variants, including Omicron, but also something that can protect for at least a year.”
The bigger picture: Pfizer’s call for a fourth shot comes as experts continue to monitor the need for another dose of the vaccine as COVID-19 case numbers drop and immunity increases.
- Sweden’s public health department in February recommended that people 80 years old and older receive a second COVID-19 booster shot, which would be a fourth shot overall, according to The New York Times.
- Dr. Eddie Stenehjem, Intermountain Healthcare infectious diseases physician, told the Deseret News that most Utahns shouldn’t need another COVID-19 booster shot.

https://www.deseret.com/utah/2022/2/22/22946370/vaccine-passport-utah-covid-19-vaccine-mandate-requirement-protected-class-businesses-rights-freedom/,A vaccine passport ban is making its way through the Utah Legislature. Here’s what’s happening,Deseret News,2022-02-23T00:27:35Z,"A bill to prohibit the use of vaccine passports by employers or governments passed the House this legislative session despite fears that it takes an overly broad approach that could hamstring future public health efforts.
HB60 would essentially make vaccination status a protected class — similar to race, sex and religion — and prevent employers from requiring vaccination as a term of employment. The bill comes amid pushback against COVID-19 vaccination requirements but isn’t limited to the current pandemic.
That’s why Rep. Timothy Hawkes, R-Centerville, unsuccessfully tried to substitute the bill with one that would apply only to COVID-19. He called his substitution a “scalpel approach” that would accomplish the goal of preventing coronavirus vaccine passports without tying the hands of health officials during future pandemics — which could be more deadly than COVID-19.
Hawkes argued that creating a “protected class” of people based on vaccination status would put undue burdens on businesses. While such burdens are necessary to protect people based on their race or sex, he said vaccination status is different.
He pointed to exemptions in the bill for health care industries as evidence that vaccines can be compelled in certain situations.
“That’s because vaccines are a bit tricky, because a transmissible illness potentially affects other people’s rights,” Hawkes said. “It’s tricky that way, and that’s why we don’t treat it the same way that we might treat race or religion or things like that. If it was something like race or religion ... we wouldn’t accept exemptions to it.”
Rep. Jennifer Dailey-Provost, D-Salt Lake City, also supported the substitution, arguing that it puts “our state and our businesses in Utah at extreme risk.”
Hawkes’ motion to target the bill toward COVID-19 failed, and the House passed the earlier version that was discussed in committee last week.
Rep. Walt Brooks, R-St. George, who sponsored the bill, acknowledged the difficulty in finding a balance between individual liberty and public health, but said he believes the bill does a good job of that.
“No one has a right to your personal information. You don’t have the right to go spread disease. So, we have to figure out where do we draw this line,” he said.
Brooks argued that his bill is an effort to protect the privacy of citizens and would prevent them from having to “show papers” to enter businesses and public spaces. Privacy was a key factor for others who spoke in favor of the bill.
“It is worth it to have a protected class related to privacy. ... We need to stop getting into the middle of each other’s health information,” said Rep. Brady Brammer, R-Highland.
If a future crisis arises, Brammer said the Legislature and governor could create exemptions from the bill or pass future laws to enact vaccine mandates if need be. The governor has the power to declare a public health emergency for up to 30 days, after which the Legislature would need to vote to continue it.
Rep. Merrill Nelson, R-Grantsville, took issue with repeated calls for privacy and freedom that lack any mention of responsibility to protect one another. Even though Utahns are learning to live with the virus, he pointed out that COVID-19 has taken a severe toll on the state.
“We hear often now, what the low infection rates are and the low death rates, ‘It’s only killed 1,000 people.’ Which, you know, I guess that’s OK if it doesn’t include your family,” he said.
To date, 4,372 Utahns have died from COVID-19, according to the Utah Department of Health.
The bill ignores the “social compact” people have as a society, Nelson said, and “grants our citizens a right to infect others.” From a conservative perspective, he compared the issue to that of abortion, saying he thinks the right of a woman’s “bodily autonomy” is superseded by a fetus’ right to life.
Getting vaccinated is an “obligation,” he said, pushing back on those who say they have “a fundamental, God-given right to go wherever ... whether I’m contagious or not.”
“That’s an entirely selfish perspective of rights,” he said.
“It is true that we should have a sense of community,” said Rep. Mark Strong, R-Bluffdale. “It is true that we don’t know what the future holds. But for me, it is true, from the bottom of my feet to the top of my head, that no one should ask you to do something against my will that is not reversible.”
In closing the discussion, Brooks rejected the idea that lawmakers are “using a mandate to remove a mandate,” saying they were acting as “the voice of the people to remove that mandate.”

The news: A new study — published on the preprint website MedRxiv ahead of peer review — found that the omicron variant creates fewer severe COVID-19 symptoms among patients, including the unvaccinated, Bloomberg reports.
- The study was done by the Western Cape and South African National Departments of Health and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa.
What the study said: “The omicron coronavirus variant causes less severe disease than the delta strain even in those who are unvaccinated or who haven’t had a prior COVID-19 infection,” per Bloomberg.

Yes, but: The World Health Organization said Wednesday that the omicron variant can be a “dangerous virus” for the unvaccinated, per Reuters.
- “Omicron still represents a massive threat to their life and a massive threat to their health,” said Dr. Mike Ryan, director of the WHO’s health emergencies program, per CNBC.
- President Joe Biden said in December that the omicron variant is dangerous for vaccinated people: “For unvaccinated, we are looking at a winter of severe illness and death ... for themselves, their families and the hospitals they’ll soon overwhelm,” Biden added. “But there’s good news. If you’re vaccinated, and you have your booster shot, you’re protected from severe illness and death, period.”",2022-01-15T03:30:00Z,2022,1,12

Why you may not want to trust your negative at-home test,Deseret News,2022-07-05T00:00:00Z,"So you’ve taken a home test for COVID-19 and it’s negative. That means you’re virus-free, right?
Maybe. Maybe not.
You may still be sick and able to spread the disease that continues to cause rising case counts, hospitalizations and deaths in Utah, including the loss of 19 lives to COVID-19 in the state during the final week of June, according to the Utah Department of Health and Human Services.
Swabbing to see if symptoms like the sniffles or a fever are COVID-19 rather than allergies, a cold or the flu has become routine for many Utahns, even if they’re fully vaccinated and boosted, but the rapid antigen tests available for home use need to be used properly to get the most accurate results, experts say.
For starters, there’s a reason the tests are packaged two to a box. You’re supposed to double-check the initial result with a follow-up test within a day or two, said Han Kim, a professor of public health at Westminster College in Salt Lake City.
“They recommend doing it twice,” he said, even though studies suggest most people only take one of the two tests in the home kit. “That’s why these tests come in two. That’s not to test two times in the next month. It is really for a single test.”
The reason for swabbing a second time is that even if you are starting to feel sick or have just been exposed to someone with COVID-19, you may not yet have enough of a viral load for there to be a detectable amount of antigens, the proteins resulting from the infection, Kim said.
So if you take the test too soon, there’s the risk of getting a false negative result.
But the omicron variant, which fueled last winter’s record-breaking surge in cases in Utah and the rest of the country and has since mutated into new subvariants that continue to spread, does have a quick incubation period of only two to four days, so waiting too long to test isn’t a good idea, either.
“That’s the trick,” Kim said, of timing a home test just right, and why another test is necessary.
Other issues with rapid antigen tests done at home include user error. The swabs must be inserted far enough in the nasal cavity to collect enough antigens. The sample must be stirred enough in the provided solution, dropped in the right place on the test strip and the results read correctly.
There’s always the possibility of getting a faulty test kit, too.
The other option for testing for COVID-19 is a PCR, or polymerase chain reaction, a more accurate test that can identify an infection sooner since it looks for the virus itself. But a PCR test must be done through a health care provider and sent to a lab for processing, so it can take a day or more to get results.
Kim said anyone whose first at-home test is positive should assume they have COVID-19 and take precautions, like wearing a mask and avoiding others for at least five days. Even those who initially test negative might want to do the same until they’re cleared by a second negative test, he said.
And ideally, any positive at-home test should be followed up by a PCR test, Kim said, because while rare, false positives are possible. Plus, the results of at-home tests are not reported to authorities and may not be accepted when required for travel or other purposes.
Dr. Emily Spivak, an infectious diseases physician with University of Utah Health, experienced firsthand the issues with home tests when she had COVID-19 in mid-May.
“I had two or three days of pretty significant symptoms with a rapid (test) that was negative. I think on that second or third day, I said to my husband, ‘I need to do a PCR because this doesn’t make sense,’” Spivak said. Sure enough, her PCR test was positive.
“I continued to do a rapid because I was curious what was going to happen. And my rapid the very next day turned positive. Like very positive, very quickly,” she said, adding that’s not going to be true for everyone. One of her daughters tested positive using a home test kit within 12 hours of showing symptoms.
“It is definitely possible to be symptomatic with COVID and your rapid test is initially negative,” Spivak said, recommending that people with symptoms get a definitive answer from a PCR test or plan on doing daily rapid tests while their symptoms persist to see if they eventually test positive.
Rapid tests are more effective in people with symptoms, she said, but may still yield a false negative result within the first 72 hours or so of signs of the virus showing up. Try again in a day or two, Spivak said, urging everyone to read the directions that come with the home kit, and watch for faulty tests.
“I had one that was faulty. I’m not sure if I did something wrong, but it never started to flow up. I don’t know if I didn’t drop enough drops, or messed them up in the wells, but it’s like the wetness, the moisture, never went up,” the doctor said, adding she knows of others who’ve had similar trouble with the kits.
“It’s not common, but it definitely can happen,” Spivak said.
Home test kits can be pricey to purchase, costing 20 times the $1.25 that Kim regularly saw them available for during a recent trip to Asia. The U.S. government is offering a third round of free at-home COVID-19 tests through the mail, but future funding for the administration’s virus response remains hung up in Congress.
Utahns were encouraged to stay away from overwhelmed free mass testing sites during the height of the omicron surge and the state later shifted most testing for the virus to private providers under the “steady state” approach taken by Gov. Spencer Cox that treats COVID-19 more like the flu or other endemic diseases.",2022-07-05T00:00:00Z,2022,3,12
https://www.deseret.com/2022/10/6/23391007/covid-19-variant-winter-surge-fauci/,Will a new COVID-19 variant drive a winter surge in cases?,Deseret News,2022-10-06T19:00:23Z,"Some experts are warning a new COVID-19 variant could emerge and spark a surge in cases this winter.
“We should not be surprised” if that happens, Dr. Anthony Fauci said during a virtual event Monday with the USC Annenberg Center for Health Journalism. “We should anticipate that we very well may get another variant that would emerge that would elude the immune response that we’ve gotten from infection and/or from vaccination.”
And a virologist at Imperial College London in England, Tom Peacock, expressed a similar concern in an interview posted Thursday by STAT, a Boston-based medical journalism publication.
“We’re also coming up to the one-year anniversary of omicron, so something else could come and just make everything else extinct,” Peacock said. “We should never forget that SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has done that once, and can absolutely do it again.”
Peacock said while “everyone’s looking at these minute changes in all these sublineages” of COVID-19, “suddenly Pi comes through and torpedoes the whole lot,” a reference to the next letter in the Greek alphabet, that presumably would be the name of the next major variant.
Fauci, who is set to step down at the end of the year as President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, advised caution as the season changes even though COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths have dropped nationwide over the past few months — and Biden’s declaration that the pandemic is over.
“I think it would be a bit cavalier to all of a sudden say, ‘We’re completely through with it,’” Fauci said. “Because remember, we were going in the right direction in the summer of 2021 and then along came delta (a variant of COVID-19). Then in the winter, November-December of 2021, along came omicron.”
Since then, a string of new omicron strains have continued to surface, including the BA.5 subvariant that continues to dominate U.S. cases but appears to have peaked in early September as other versions of the virus rise. The recently approved updated COVID-19 booster shot targets BA.5 and another subvariant on the decline, BA.4.
“Right now, it looks like we’re going in the right direction. However, we are entering into the winter months, where no matter what the respiratory disease is, there’s always a risk of an uptick,” Fauci said, especially given the “creeping up” of new omicron subvariants already spreading in other countries.
“We can’t let our guard down,” he said, calling it “entirely conceivable” that cases could climb high enough by the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays that masking at gatherings would be recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
With cases headed back up in Europe, Peacock said some of the newer omicron subvariants seen there “may be the vanguard of this variant wave that we’re going to get over the winter, but that the really nasty ones are still at, what, a percentage point or a couple percentage points in prevalence.”
That means the worst is likely yet to come, the virologist from England said.
“So you have the first ones that will get replaced as the wave comes through by these nastier ones that are currently at lower prevalence,” Peacock said. “We could end up with a mix, and different countries end up with different mixes.”",2022-10-06T19:00:23Z,2022,4,12
https://www.deseret.com/opinion/2022/12/3/23486872/opinion-federal-drug-price-caps-hurt-research/,Opinion: Federal price caps on drugs could have major consequences on research,Deseret News,2022-12-03T16:00:00Z,"Federal price controls on prescription medication offer a seemingly easy solution to the serious challenge patients face in paying for their drugs. But diving deep on this question, beyond the soundbites and social media posts — as Sen. Mike Lee and others have had the courage to do — shows some significant long-term risks for patients across Utah who are eagerly awaiting new, innovative therapies.
Throughout the recently concluded campaign, Lee took criticism for raising significant concerns about the drug price caps contained in the federal Inflation Reduction Act. Taking the longer view and asking tough questions are never easy when the focus in politics — particularly during campaign season — is more on scoring the next quick win on social media. But in the case of these federal price controls there are significant unintended consequences for research and development of new medicines.
Here’s why the red flags raised by Lee and other elected officials in both parties are on point, and why the politically motivated criticisms of his objections are off base. While we must continue to find solutions that will provide significant and lasting cost relief to patients, we cannot do that at the expense of patients who desperately need new medicines to help them fight their diseases.
Consider the hundreds of patients across Utah and the tens of thousands across the country who suffer from hemophilia and other chronic bleeding disorders. Access to often expensive but essential medicines helps preserve their quality of life. On average, the annual cost of hemophilia treatments ranges between $300,000 up to $1 million. Those costs can skyrocket if a patient faces even minor surgery.
Given these high costs, it would be easy to assume that the hemophilia community would be enthusiastically on board for federal price caps. But not so fast.
Utah patients with bleeding disorders are keenly focused on the research, and development of new therapies that can stop bleeding more effectively and address the genetic roots of the diseases are eagerly awaited. In just the past few years, we have seen more and more treatments enter clinical trials.
Many of these innovations are attempting to replace the existing clotting factor in blood, while others are focused on new means to stop bleeding. The clinical trial phase is the pivotal testing phase to determine if these new medicines are safe and effective for use on patients. These complex innovations include gene therapy and cell therapy, and others are out on the frontier of medical research.
Exciting, for sure. But as we all have learned in the national effort to develop vaccines and treatments quickly and safely for COVID-19, research and development is not only painstaking and time consuming, but very expensive. Bringing just one new drug to market can cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Each massive investment is no guarantee that promising research can produce a marketable drug.
While many policymakers are laser focused on cutting drug costs, it is imperative that they also look at how revenue from medicines currently on the market is harnessed for research in the drugs and other therapies of the future. Today, before government price setting has taken effect, patients in the U.S. have access to 90% of new drugs. This is a far cry from patients in countries that have embraced price controls who have access to just half of new medicines.
There are significant solutions available to truly help patients and make medicines more affordable — without risking the research pipeline that offers such hope to patients across Utah and the nation. We need more leaders like Lee who tackle the nuances, and unintended consequences of headline-generating proposals. That is what patients are counting on from Congress as leaders reconvene next year.

Here's where you can get tested this week,Deseret News,2022-02-21T22:24:36Z,"The Utah health department is preparing to transition all COVID-19 testing to the health care system in the coming weeks; however, officials sent a reminder Monday that public health testing is still available in the state up until that happens.
The Utah Department of Health released its testing sites for the week on Monday, which includes dozens of sites across the state. As the number of people getting tested declines, none of the sites require a reservation.
Some of the regular daily locations are closed Monday for Presidents Day. That list includes:
- 5-C Freeport West (Clearfield): Site reopens at 8 a.m. on Tuesday
- Cory Wride Park (Eagle Mountain): Site reopens at 9 a.m. on Tuesday
- Utah State Fairpark (Salt Lake City): Site reopens at 11 a.m. on Tuesday
- Willow Park (Lehi): Site reopens at 1 p.m. on Wednesday
The full list of testing site locations, testing times and other important information regarding COVID-19 testing can be found online, here.
The health department won't provide its daily COVID-19 case update Monday because of the holiday. Those daily updates, which originated in March 2020, will also be phased into weekly reports by the end of next month as Utah health care systems take over testing.
Utah's seven-day, running average of new cases dropped to 1,055 new cases per day compared to nearly 11,000 on Jan. 18, as the health department reported on Friday. The state's ""test over test"" seven-day average rate of positive tests also fell from 47% on Jan. 21 to 26% on Feb. 12.
Even though the demand for tests has fallen as the number of new cases has declined, the health department still recommends certain people get tested should they experience symptoms.
- People with ""significant"" underlying conditions. The health department said people in this category may also be eligible for treatments like monoclonal antibodies or antiviral pills.
- Elderly people.
- People who plan to visit someone who is vulnerable because of age or underlying conditions.
- People who work with vulnerable populations, such as health care workers, long-term care facility employees or people who live and work in congregate settings.
- People who have been sick, are improving and want to confirm they no longer have COVID-19.
- People who are traveling to somewhere that requires a negative COVID-19 test.
Gov. Spencer Cox, who announced the upcoming, gradual move to a ""steady state,"" said Friday that Utah is in a ""much better place"" than it was when COVID-19 was first reported to be in the state nearly two years ago. That's because it's easier to find COVID-19 testing now, and there is also a vaccine and treatments that can help reduce the effects of the coronavirus that didn't exist in March 2020.
""We have tools today that we didn't have two months ago, including widespread home tests and antiviral pills,"" the governor, added in his reasoning to scale back Utah's pandemic response. ""It's now time to transition out of an emergency posture and into a manageable risk model.""
Cox went on to say Friday that testing, either at home or through various health care systems, will still be important after March 31. He said the state health department will also continue to oversee disease surveillance, data collection, vaccinations and public awareness of the coronavirus.
""This is not the end of COVID,"" he said, ""but it is the beginning of treating COVID as we do other seasonal respiratory viruses.""",2022-02-21T22:24:36Z,2022,1,12
https://www.deseret.com/2022/4/4/22981386/utah-gymnastics-kara-eaker-returned-just-in-time-red-rocks-to-contend-ncaa-national-championships/,Kara Eaker has returned to form at the perfect time for Utah,Deseret News,2022-04-04T18:25:00Z,"The look on Kara Eaker’s face said it all.
She had just finished competing on balance beam at the Seattle Regional final. Just finished hugging her teammates and celebrating that she had nailed her routine.
Then the scores were unveiled.
Eaker had earned a perfect 10, the first of her collegiate career and it had come in only her fifth competitive beam routine.
Joy radiated from her. It was a display of excitement and happiness that is difficult to put into words, the closest description having something to do with a bright-eyed toddler opening presents on Christmas morning.
Given the setting and the stakes — Utah was locked in an incredibly close competition with No. 5 Alabama and No. 12 Michigan State, and only the top two teams would advance to nationals — it was understandable.
Eaker’s routine came with immense pressure, and her successful performance set the stage for Maile O’Keefe to win the regional final for Utah and send the Red Rocks to nationals for the 46th consecutive season.
But Eaker’s triumph in Seattle wasn’t just about that single meet or a single routine.
Isolated and alone
The last year in Eaker’s life has been filled with setbacks and disappointments, amid some of the greatest achievements of her gymnastics career.
Eaker is one of the most decorated athletes to ever compete for Utah. Before coming to Utah, Eaker was:
- A four-year member of the U.S. National Team (2017-21).
- A two-time world champion as a member of Team USA.
- Considered one of, if not the best, beam workers in the world, after finishing first in the event at the 2017 U.S. Championships, the 2018 American Classic, the 2018 and ’19 Pan American Championships and the 2019 U.S. Classic.
At the 2021 U.S. Olympic Trials, after a summer of training amid pandemic-induced restrictions, Eaker was excellent and finished second on beam, sixth on floor and seventh in the all-around.
It wasn’t quite enough for her to be named one of the four U.S. team members that would go on to win the silver medal in Tokyo. Those honors went to Simone Biles, Sunisa Lee, Jordan Chiles and Grace McCallum, while Jade Carey and MyKayla Skinner competed for the U.S. as individuals.
Eaker was named a U.S. alternate, though, along with Leanne Wong, Emma Malabuyo and Kayla DiCello, and she traveled to Japan determined to be ready if called upon.
It was there that everything fell apart.
After arriving in Japan, Eaker tested positive for COVID-19, despite having been vaccinated. That positive test meant that there was no chance that she would be able to compete at the Olympic Games.
Barring a run at the 2024 Paris Olympics, Eaker’s international career was done.
It was worse than that, though. As part of the procedures established to limit the spread of COVID-19, Eaker was quarantined in a hotel room, not even in Tokyo, almost completely removed from her teammates and coaches.
For 10 days she was alone, her only human contact occurring when her coach would come stand in the hallway, far away from the entrance to Eaker’s room, and Eaker would open the door and the pair would chat briefly.
It was enough to drive anyone crazy.
“I couldn’t have connection with my own teammate Leanne or my coaches,” Eaker told the Deseret News. “At first I was like, ‘I can take a breather and rest for a little bit,’ but after three days I started going a little crazy having to be by myself that long. It was not fun.”
Never had she ever
Upon her return home to Grain Valley, Missouri, Eaker set her sights on Utah. She had signed with the Red Rocks on Nov. 11, 2020, but did so sight unseen.
Before landing in Salt Lake City ahead of the fall semester in 2021, Eaker had never seen the Wasatch Front, walked around the U. or met most of her teammates.
What could have compelled one of the best gymnasts in the country to commit to the University of Utah without even seeing it? That would be who, the answer being Utah head coach Tom Farden.
The first time Eaker remembers meeting Farden was in October 2018, at the Pan American Championships.
It was a short introduction, but the beginning of a relationship that would lead Eaker to Salt Lake City.
“We went to breakfast and he was there,” Eaker said. “(Tom) had been at competitions that my previous coach Al (Fong) had hosted, but I got to meet him then.”
Farden would follow Eaker around the world, to South America, Europe and all over the United States.
She was the ideal Utah recruit, and Farden wasn’t about to let her go somewhere else without a fight.
“(Kara) always had high E (execution) scores,” Farden explained, “and I have benchmarks for E scores when I recruit. Hers were always magnificent.”
Even to this day, Farden’s eyes light up when he talks about Eaker. She was, and remains, the ideal college gymnast.
Much of her prowess with execution can be traced back to her club gym, Great American Gymnastics Express.
“That was always an emphasis at her club,” Farden said.
While other elite gymnasts focused on improving their difficulty or D scores, Eaker was always focused on execution.
She was committed to perfecting her skills, even if they were slightly less difficult than the ones performed by some of her peers.
“My whole elite career I focused on perfection, rather than difficulty,” Eaker said. “My skills weren’t always as hard as the other girls, so I had to make my execution stand out.”
It should be noted that Eaker still has quite the repertoire of skills. You don’t contend for a spot on the U.S. Olympic team and not have an array of astounding abilities.
“It blows your mind,” Farden said. “You have these athletes and they come in, these national team kids, these Olympians, and they have this assortment of skills.
“They are like ‘Oh I can do that, I’ve done this, I can do that,’ and as a coach you’re like ‘Well what haven’t you done? That is right, there is not much.”
What convinced Eaker to take her elite skills and execution to Utah had nothing to do with gymnastics, though. Instead, it was schooling and Farden’s support of it.
A mechanical engineering major, Eaker is a student first and a gymnast second, and Utah’s engineering program, coupled with Farden’s support of gymnasts’ pursuit of their educations, was enough to convince her that Utah was the place for her.
“I am very happy with my decision to come here,” Eaker said. “Tom was really supportive of my decision and my major.
“He provides a lot of help and support, connecting you with people that you need. Knowing that I had that support from him and the program really stood out to me.”
The ankle injury
Before this season, Eaker was primed for an elite freshman campaign, possibly not all that dissimilar from what her friend and former teammate Wong has done at Florida.
Despite some issues with her shoulders — it was nothing serious enough to require surgery, but she did go through rehab after arriving at Utah — Eaker was in rare form at the Red Rocks Preview in late December.
“I thought Kara did excellent,” Farden said, after Utah’s annual preseason showcase. “I think she was in the same ranks on her two events as Maile was on her three. Championship form already.”
Entering Utah’s season opener at the Best of Utah, Eaker was slated to compete on three events — beam, floor and vault — and if everything had gone according to plan, she would have been one of Utah’s most significant contributors this season, along with O’Keefe, McCallum, Abby Paulson, Cristal Isa and Sydney Soloski.
Instead, while warming up on vault during the meet, Eaker injured her ankle, suffering a Grade 2 sprain.
Initially, there were fears that she was done for the season. That was the first prognosis delivered to Farden and his staff.
Ultimately, it was determined that the sprain wasn’t season-ending, though Eaker would lose the majority of her freshman year.
To say that was difficult news is an understatement, and the subsequent rehab and recovery — while watching her teammates compete through the highs and lows of the season — weighed on Eaker.
“It definitely got really grueling, knowing that I couldn’t be up there with them and had to watch,” she said.
Recovery itself wasn’t easy. Eaker had escaped serious injury throughout much her career, making the long rehab process a relatively new experience.
“It took a longer time to feel like I could have a full range of motion and balance,” she said. “It was the dumbest stuff, too, like standing on one leg without falling over. I couldn’t do that for the longest time.”
And even now, after making her return to competition, Eaker isn’t 100% healthy.
“It is definitely a lot better,” she said. “There is some stiffness post competition and after some practices. It took a really really long time to get my balance back, and build the strength back in my calf and in my ankle.
“I can’t do everything yet, because I don’t have the ability. I’m just trying to build back the strength, but it feels good.”
New and improved
Eaker’s injury wasn’t without its benefits, crazy as that sounds.
The injury and subsequent rehab necessitated that she spend significant time with Farden, time that was used refine her routines and skill selection.
Eaker, who is currently available to compete on bars, beam and floor, has a new first pass on floor as a result.
“She will go front layout, front double full,” Farden said. “It is a dynamite first pass now, with even more bonus. It is going to be better for her in the end.
“Because of her injury she couldn’t punch backward as quickly as she could punch forward, just with the mechanics of the ankle, so we changed it.”
Her teammates have watched her evolution first hand, and Eaker has left them in awe of her ability to come back the way that she has.
“Obviously she is extremely talented,” Soloski said. “I don’t think that is a surprise to anyone. But it is really difficult to get hurt that first meet, miss the entire regular season and then be put in right before postseason. That takes a lot of mental toughness. She has done a phenomenal job, especially on beam, getting back to where she was.
“That kid is a competitor. She is tough. When it is competition time, her blinders go on and she is very focused on what she needs to do. There is not much that really affects her. It is always good to have kids like that on your team. She can go, she can hit, she can do her thing.”
With her perfect routine to close out regionals, Eaker announced to the world that she is back and not one to be overlooked.

Here’s what to know,Deseret News,2022-06-27T23:18:34Z,"By the end of this week, almost 30 states will have completed their 2022 primary elections, according to FiveThirtyEight. Here are five states to watch as votes roll in on Tuesday: Colorado, Illinois, New York, Oklahoma and Utah.
Utah
The Deseret News’ Kyle Dunphey states that the Republican primary races are of importance, due to the fact that they largely determine the overall winners in “deep red Utah.”
For U.S. Senate, incumbent Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, is being challenged by Becky Edwards and Ally Isom. One of these three will face Independent Evan McMullin, backed by the Utah Democratic Party, in November.
Lee has received backlash, according to Axios, due to text messages he sent to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows about challenging the 2020 presidential election results.
Despite the controversy, a Deseret News/Hinckley Institute of Politics poll shows that 67% of voters plan to vote for Lee on Tuesday.
Colorado
For the first time, some Colorado Democratic voters are registering as Republican or unaffiliated in hopes of driving out GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert, according to The New York Times.
Democrats in the state fear Boebert, a candidate who supports former President Donald Trump, embodies extremism and authoritarianism, the Times states. Instead, they are planning to vote for her Republican opponent, Don Coram.
Illinois
NPR calls the Illinois gubernatorial race a battle between billionaires, with some of the country’s richest people running for office.
The Democratic incumbent, Gov. JB Pritzker, is being challenged by Democrat Beverly Miles. On the Republican side, six candidates are pulling for the nomination: Darren Bailey, Richard Irvin, Gary Rabine, Paul Schimpf, Max Solomon and Jesse Sullivan, according to Ballotpedia.
In the seventh district, President Joe Biden has endorsed Rep. Danny Davis, who has been serving in the district since 1997, according to NBC Chicago. He is facing a challenge from candidates Kina Collins and Denarvis Mendenhall.
New York
New York has a unique election year with two primary elections — one in June and one in August. This decision was made by a judge due to a lawsuit and redistricting, Fox 5 New York reports.
Tuesday’s race will be for state Assembly seats, statewide officers, governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, comptroller and the U.S. Senate. August’s election will be for congressional and state Senate seats, Fox says.
The New York Times states that incumbent Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul has taken a more lax approach to campaigning this year, with only five official events in the last month and a lack of on-foot canvassing within the streets of the state. Some worry that this could cost the incumbent her position.
Running against Hochul are Democrats Thomas Suozzi and Jumaane D. Williams. The Republican candidates in the race are Rob Astorino, Andrew H. Giuliani, Harry Wilson and Lee M. Zeldin, according to NYCvotes.gov.

Incumbent Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican, is seeking reelection, according to OUDaily. He is being challenged by three other Republicans: Mark Sherwood, a doctor and former SWAT officer, Joel Kintsel, director of the state Department of Veterans Affairs, and Moira McCabe, an anti-abortion stay-at-home mother.
Joy Hofmeister switched parties from Republican to Democrat when she announced her run for governor. She said there is “much work to do” in regards to gun safety and education, OUDaily reports. The other Democratic candidate running for governor is former state Sen. Connie Johnson.
Ervin Stone Yen, the independent gubernatorial candidate, also left the Republican Party when he decided to run. Natalie Bruno is the only Libertarian candidate and is known to speak out against vaccine and mask mandates.",2022-06-27T23:18:34Z,2022,2,12

However, there hasn’t been enough research yet on the severity of the new omicron subvariants, BA.4 and BA.5, said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a recent news briefing.
“We do know it to be more transmissible and more immune evading. People with prior infection, even with BA.1 or BA.2, are likely still at risk for BA.4 or BA.5,” she added.
Currently, BA.5 makes up 65% of cases in the U.S. BA.4 has a hold over 16.3% of cases, while BA.2.12.1 represents more than 17%. Meanwhile, new cases as of July 12 hovered over 180,000, but this number doesn’t tell the full story.
“We estimate that for every reported case there are seven unreported,” Ali Mokdad, professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, told CNN. Expert Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, estimates that new cases are actually reaching close to one million per day with this BA.5 wave.
How to protect yourself against BA.4 and BA.5?
The omicron mutations give the virus the ability to evade antibodies generated by the original or delta strain, a preliminary study found.
But the study also found that antibodies, from previous infection or vaccination, can reduce the severity of infection.
Walensky stated that those over the age of 50 are recommended to stay up-to-date with their vaccines, which includes two booster shots. Only 28% of those over 50 and 34% over 65 have received a second booster, she added.
“My message right now is very simple: It’s essential that these Americans get their second booster shot right away,” Walensky said, stating that this age group is at four times the higher risk of death without the complete, or close to complete, series of COVID-19 shots.
When to expect the new COVID-19 vaccine?
In the press briefing, Dr. Ashish Jha, coordinator for the White House COVID-19 Response Team, said that an order for 105 million bivalent vaccine doses was placed with Pfizer more than a week ago.
“Obviously, that will not be enough for all Americans. We are continuing to think about other orders, and talking to other companies,” she said. “But that order has been placed to get the next generation of bivalent vaccines, as directed by FDA and FDA’s recommendations about what specific makeup of that vaccine will be.”
What are the omicron symptoms to look out for?
As I previously reported, omicron subvariants have a shorter incubation period, which is why the symptoms may appear earlier.
The worst symptom typically experienced by patients has been a severe sore throat. The most common omicron-related symptoms are:
- Cough.
- Fatigue.
- Congestion.
- Runny nose.",2022-07-14T20:00:00Z,2022,3,12

More than 10 million doses held back by the the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a result of a safety inspection at a packaging plant in Indiana should soon become available nationwide, The Washington Post reported.
No issues were found at the plant, the newspaper reported, and FDA spokesman Michael Felberbaum said in a statement to the newspaper that the agency authorized the “distribution of numerous batches” of the updated vaccine Tuesday that were manufactured there.
“This authorization was based on FDA’s determination that the batches met all applicable specifications, following a careful review of information provided by Moderna about the manufacture of these batches. The agency has no concerns with the safety, effectiveness, or quality of these batches,” Felberbaum told the Post.
Safety inspectors started raising concerns about production at the Indiana plant, including that “the facility was not sufficiently sterile,” and checked to see if vials packaged there may have been contaminated, the Post reported, citing “people with knowledge of the inspection.”
A spokesman for the plant operator, Catalent, Chris Halling, said in a statement to the newspaper that, “A recent FDA inspection at our Bloomington facility resulted in observations that Catalent is already addressing, as it seeks to continuously improve its operations. Production at the facility has continued without interruption.”
Moderna told the Post it is “working closely” with the government to deliver additional doses of its updated COVID-19 booster vaccine amid “high demand” in some parts of the country.
“We anticipate that these availability constraints will be resolved in the coming days,” Moderna spokesman Chris Ridley said. “We continue to be on track to meet our committed delivery of 70 million doses of our updated, bivalent vaccine by the end of this year.”
Some states, including California, Arizona and Pennsylvania, as well as chain pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens that receive a separate distribution of COVID-19 vaccines from the federal government, have run into shortages of the new Moderna booster shots,
That hasn’t been the case in Utah, said Rich Lakin, the Utah Department of Heath and Human Services’ immunization director.
“All the doses we have ordered have been received by providers,” Lakin said. “We are waiting for our next allocation (from the federal government) to submit orders.” He said he doesn’t yet know when the state will place a new order for doctors, local pharmacies, health departments and others giving the shots.
Utah initially ordered more than 100,000 doses of the new booster vaccines from the federal government.
Both Moderna and Pfizer booster shots, the first to be reformulated to target the COVID-19 omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 that are currently circulating, were authorized by the government at the end of August for those who received their initial vaccination series or a booster dose at least two months ago.
People must be at least 18 to receive Moderna’s updated booster, while Pfizer’s is available to those as young as 12.
Other than the age requirement, the new Pfizer and Modern booster shots are “interchangeable,” Lori Abeyta, a clinical specialist with Intermountain Healthcare, recently told the Deseret News. “There’s no preference between one over the other. They should just get the one that they’re able to easily attain.”",2022-09-21T20:01:37Z,2022,3,12

Is it reason for concern?,Deseret News,2022-08-23T03:08:56Z,"This new omicron subvariant has been the cause of many cases in the Midwest, but how concerning is BA.4.6?
Health experts are still mostly unclear about this mutation that first emerged between April and May. It is now responsible for 6.3% of reported cases, according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
What do we know about omicron subvariant BA.4.6?
Like other omicron strains, the BA.4.6 also has an ability to evade immunity, Dr. Sharon Welbel, the director of Hospital Epidemiology and Infection Control for Cook County Health, told NBC affiliate WMAQ.
“So BA.4.6 is a descendant of omicron BA.4. It does have an additional mutation in the spike protein and as you probably know this spike protein is what helps the virus get into human cells. So it also has the advantage, because of this mutation in the spike protein, to have additional immune escape...” said Welbel. “These newer variants of concern, help the virus itself escape natural immunity, or immunity that we have from vaccines or both.”
If BA.4.6 is highly infectious, will immunity from a BA.5 infection offer any protection? Welbel said it is hard to know right now, adding that “having had natural immunity to BA.5 will help protect us against getting seriously ill or dying from it.”
So, what are the omicron symptoms to look out for?
As I previously reported, here are the common symptoms of COVID-19:
- Fever or chills.
- Cough.
- Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.
- Fatigue.
- Muscle or body aches.
- Headache.
- New loss of taste or smell.
- Sore throat.
- Congestion or runny nose.
- Nausea or vomiting.
- Diarrhea.
But here are the four most commonly reported omicron symptoms, published in a CDC report:

What’s happening: The seven-day average for COVID-19 cases in the United States hovered around 59,000 cases per day last week, a sign that the coronavirus outbreak is still here, though dropping compared to winter peaks.
What to expect: Public health experts recently told The Guardian that leaders should use the ongoing lull period to prepare for future outbreaks.
What they’re saying: Abraar Karan, an infectious disease physician at Stanford University, told The Guardian the pandemic isn’t over and that officials should use the time right now to prepare for the next COVID-19 variant, which could be more transmissible.
- “Once we have another variant, whenever that may be, the amount of spread from that variant will depend on what kind of preparedness we do now,” he said. “What are we doing to make schools, workplaces and public spaces more safe?”
What’s next: Dr. Mark Dybul, a professor at Georgetown University Medical Center’s Department of Medicine and immunologist, said back in November — days before the omicron variant arrived — that he expected a new variant to arrive in the spring, per Fortune.
- “Sadly, every prediction I’ve made has pretty much come true,” he said. “I hope I’m wrong this time, but I think by March, April, May, we will have a fully vaccine-resistant variant. There’s simply no way you can have such low rates of vaccination around the world with the virus ping-ponging between vaccinated and unvaccinated people. I’m an immunologist. The probability of us seeing a vaccine-resistant strain is very high.”
The bottom line: Jason Salemi, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of South Florida College of Public Health, told The Guardian: “We need to expect the unexpected with COVID-19.”",2022-03-08T15:00:00Z,2022,1,12

Spencer Cox has every right to be concerned about teachers and the future of public education at all levels. The institutions that have served the United States since colonial days have provided the best investment in future citizens that could be imagined.
Public schools, at every level, have asked citizens to support the common goal of providing educational opportunities for citizens of all ages. In the midst of this crusade, a large group of public servants has chosen to devote its talents and careers to making the system remain relevant.
During the COVID pandemic, families, teachers and students were required to adapt in unique and creative ways. They worked together to assist children achieve their dreams, as politicians, parents and critics challenged them throughout the process.
As the voices became louder and civility diminished, educators felt abandoned as mask mandates, vaccinations, and conspiracy theories clouded a rational discussion of healthcare and course content. Lately, there is a barrage of efforts aimed at what is termed Critical Race Theory or, simply, the teaching of racial issues and their causation in the schools.
For many politicians, this is the phrase that can carry them to victory in the next election. After an extensive search of public education courses and texts, it is safe to conclude that Critical Race Theory is not a major part of Utah’s curriculum. A theory does not exist as a discipline in public education.
During the half-century that my colleagues and I have taught United States History in Utah, we have always tried to base the course on truth, facts, and trust. As scholars, we continue to learn, so interpretations may change as new facts are confirmed. The search for truth based on facts never ends. New evidence helps broaden an understanding of the past, which enables students, as citizens, to establish a broader foundation.
It is not pleasant to teach about the slave trade, slave auctions or the Middle Passage. Nor is it enjoyable to teach about how colonial powers devised ways to remove natives from their traditional lands. However, we develop empathy for our current neighbors when we understand that their path to the present differs from ours.
The Trail of Tears, Haun’s Mill, Mountain Meadows, Bear River and Fort Pillow are all racially or religiously based horrific events or massacres. They explain the world surrounding the Civil War and how violent insurrections may have been a result of the passions of the day. When I see video footage today decrying the 14th and 15th amendments as an overreach of federal authority, I am reminded of how the Compromise of 1877, led to both the loss of voting for minorities as well as racial segregation.
Indian reservations, Chinese exclusion, and LDS disfranchisement are all part of the historical story of the late 19th century. The relocation of Japanese Americans during World War II continues to remind us of what was done, but also how citizens can rise above the acts designed to injure them.
However, historians do not dwell on the instances of racial, ethnic or religious prejudice. The Declaration of Independence, U.S. Constitution, Bill of Rights and subsequent amendments provide the backdrop for a continued beautiful narrative. There are many events and people that have made the United States great. Most importantly, we as a people keep trying. The knowledge of the past, based on truth, facts, and trust, helps us create a better tomorrow.
Although some pundits decry the terms “inclusive,” “welcoming,” and “equality,” those words define the path of the United States. There are pitfalls and roadblocks along the journey, but when we recognize the contributions of all the people, we become one.
The preamble to the Constitution has eternal meaning as a goal. For the most part, it is what is taught in our schools in 2022.
Legislators nationwide would serve their constituents well by incorporating a positive, supportive posture toward education.
During COVID-19, teachers, similar to health care providers, served well under considerable duress. Our teachers had to perform in the classrooms, in front of computers and in the homes of our children. Indeed, 2022 is a great time to express gratitude through economic support for all children and their teachers instead of chasing fears that are not founded on fact, truth or trust.

After all, they had practically singled her out in legislation that now forbids any mayor from declaring a “state of emergency in response to an epidemic, a pandemic or another public health emergency.”
But, to her credit, she did not.
The Legislature’s action — in a joint resolution the governor could neither sign nor veto — erased the city’s mask mandate and kept Mendenhall from doing what she felt was needed to protect the people of her city in a pandemic.
Again, she didn’t lash out.
She did address the pandemic, but with a tone of gratitude for overworked health care workers and with a hopeful plea to people to voluntarily wear masks and get vaccinated against COVID-19. The mask mandates, she said, were put in place “because that’s what the science called for.”
Then she looked forward.
“Our government is shifting from looking at COVID as an acute crisis to treating it as a chronic condition, not because the virus is any less deadly to the unvaccinated and immunocompromised, and not because our ICUs are any less crowded, but the bitter reality is that a sudden, miraculous end to this pandemic is not coming, and frankly, the city government is running out of ways to slow the spread of the virus,” she said, adding that solutions have to come from the people.
“We will continue to do what we can and what our health experts advise — within the parameters state law allows — but we also have to acknowledge that personal responsibility is the most powerful tool remaining in our arsenal. The government can’t end this on its own. We need you.”
It has become almost customary these days to engage in sarcasm, anger and bitterness in public office. We’re glad Mendenhall has consistently chosen a different approach. Her speech made lawmakers, who regularly give lip service to the importance of governments that are closest to the people, look small.
Lawmakers erased more than just the city’s mask ordinance. They erased similar ordinances approved by leaders in Salt Lake and Summit counties, as well. In a separate bill, HB183, they ended the “test to stay” program for public schools (unless state leaders determine it is needed again) and made it almost impossible for a school to shift temporarily to online learning. If the governor signs this bill, a school board would need to petition the governor, the speaker of the House, the Senate president and the state superintendent of education for permission to temporarily move to online learning if a pandemic passes a certain threshold.
It’s hard to see how a school board could be nimble enough, under those rules, to react to any health crisis.
Salt Lake mayors, who tend to be Democrats (the job is officially nonpartisan) are used to doing battle with state lawmakers, who tend to be Republicans. In her speech, Mendenhall highlighted another frustration: the city’s struggle with homelessness.
For a brief moment, four years ago, state leaders acknowledged it was unfair for the city to shoulder a disproportionate burden of treating the homeless, when it really was a statewide problem.
Operation Rio Grande, which targeted the area around the city’s main shelter at the time and ended with the construction of new shelters, or “resource centers,” included police and politicians from several cities.
On Tuesday, the mayor again called on the state to help, as it must. But she did it without accusation, simply pointing a direction forward.
The key to civility, and to effective solutions, lies in how people approach their differences, and how they work to overcome problems. On Tuesday, Mendenhall showed the way, and we applaud that.",2022-01-26T04:49:53Z,2022,1,12
https://www.deseret.com/2022/3/1/22955419/pioneer-theatre-companys-something-rotten-review/,Pioneer Theatre Company’s ‘Something Rotten!’ is something that reminds us of the magic of theater,Deseret News,2022-03-01T16:44:47Z,"After a two-year delay, Pioneer Theatre Company opened the musical Broadway hit “Something Rotten!” Friday evening. When the coronavirus pandemic delayed the 2020 production, members of the already cast show, like many of us, had to put their lives on hold and hope to get back to the things they love.
“There have been battalions of sorrow, difficulties and challenges in the past couple years. Throughout all of them I have looked forward to bringing this valentine to musical theater onto our stage,” said “Something Rotten!” director Karen Azenberg.
As a lesser-known production, “Something Rotten!” really is a valentine to the phenomenon that is musical theater. The plot revolves around the London Renaissance, where William Shakespeare really is at the top of his game, producing hit after hit to the chagrin of the head of his former theater troupe director Nick Bottom.
Bottom sees Shakespeare as a hack, with less talent than himself and his writer brother, Nigel. In sheer frustration, Nick visits a soothsayer to see into the future and learn what the biggest thing in theater will be. It turns out to be the strange concept of singing and dancing during a play! Although it is the “Stupidest thing that (Nick) has ever heard,” he decides to put on the first musical ever. This is to everyone else’s utter confusion, including his long-suffering wife, theater company, the heavily-pressured Shakespeare, and all of London. The show unfolds on stage in an uproarious musical and Shakespearean fun, as Nick’s life unravels in his own frustrations.
Pioneer Theatre Company’s production of “Something Rotten!” was anything but rotten. It was a fun, vibrant celebration of the stage. I was impressed from the start with the colorful costumes, energetic dance and ensemble cast performance. The witty script is fast-paced, full of humor and historical references (and innuendo) that get the audience laughing right away. The sets are designed with a playful cross between realistic and illustrated look that are reminiscent of the pop-up books of childhood. And while there were some technical difficulties throughout the show regarding sound and lighting, it was all forgivable as it was opening night.
One of my favorite parts about seeing shows at PTC is knowing that the lead players and the company are both going to perform well. The ensemble cast proved that on Friday with crisp choreography, thorough and nondistracting background interactions , and understandable singing and dialogue for even the unmicrophoned. You could just see everyone was having fun on stage, particularly in the big musical numbers.
Some standout performances of the cast would be the Bottom brothers themselves, Nick Bottom, played by Matt Farcher, and Nigel Bottom, played by Daniel Plimpton. They played well off of each other with that brotherly camaraderie the role required and just enough sibling frustration to be realistic. Nick’s long-suffering wife, Bea, is played by Galyana Castillo, whose comedic prowess and impressive pipes were an audience-pleaser. Nostradamus (not THAT Nostradamus) was played by Robert Anthony Jones, who comedically kept in his role even when an ad-lib was needed. And Howard Kaye’s passionate monologue about his character Shylock’s love of the theater was my favorite part of the play.
Shylock’s love for theater is humorous, genuine, and contagious, as he spoke the lines, “But what I really love — is the theater. … I love the sights, the smells, the roar of the crowd, the splat of the fruit as it hits the actors. It’s a temple to me, I tell you. A temple! Catholic, Protestant, Jew — I don’t give a rats tuchus. My religion — is theater.”
“Something Rotten!” was one of my first experiences back in the theater as the pandemic has started to wane for vaccinated people like myself. I have always loved theater, but when it was taken away at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, I really started to appreciate it differently. It felt great to laugh and applaud with a crowd of people around me again.
There is something so visceral and palpable about live performance. This isn’t a recorded, edited and otherwise crafted film in front of you. There are real people all around you who put in tremendous effort, from the person who scans your ticket to the performer on the stage, the conductor in the orchestra pit and the stage technician who strikes the set. It is alive like no other form of entertainment.
And seeing PTC’s “Something Rotten!” celebrate that experience so much, and so well, was an absolute joy.
“Something Rotten!” runs through March 12, with evening shows Monday through Saturday and a Saturday matinee. Tickets are between $48-77 and are available at PioneerTheatre.org.

The decision announced Tuesday would make anyone 5 and older in the United States eligible for a booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine, and still requires signoff by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A CDC advisory committee of outside experts is set to review the booster doses Thursday, The New York Times reported.
Currently, the additional vaccine doses intended to boost waning immunity are available only to those 12 and up.
The FDA acted on the emergency use authorization sought by Pfizer for booster doses at least five months after the original series of shots without convening a similar panel because “the request did not raise questions that would benefit from additional discussion by committee members,” the agency said in a news release.
The safety of the shots in that age group was assessed in some 400 children who got a booster dose five to nine months after completing the initial two-dose vaccine series. Pain, redness and swelling at the injection site were the most commonly reported side effects, along with fatigue, headache, muscle or joint pain, and chills and fever.
“While it has largely been the case that COVID-19 tends to be less severe in children than adults, the omicron wave has seen more kids getting sick with the disease and being hospitalized, and children may also experience longer term effects, even following initially mild disease,” Dr. Robert M. Califf, the FDA commissioner, said in a statement.
The shots were authorized “to provide continued protection against COVID-19. Vaccination continues to be the most effective way to prevent COVID-19 and its severe consequences, and it is safe,” he said, urging parents to help ensure their children avoid the worst outcomes from the virus.
The booster shots would come as virus cases are once again on the rise in the United States, including Utah. The Biden administration is predicting there could be as many as 100 million new COVID-19 cases this fall, and a Utah Department of Health model suggests case counts could hit 2,000 a day by mid-June.
While the vaccine’s effectiveness against infection by new versions of the virus appears to be dropping, booster shots are still seen as strong protection against severe illness that leads to hospitalization and death. But just 35% of Utahns 12 and older are vaccinated and boosted, and less than 15% of Utahns 12-18 fall into that category.",2022-05-17T17:19:00Z,2022,2,12

These innovations are cutting down on human contact to help keep COVID-19 at bay.
The 2022 Winter Games have brought new events like the monobob and big air, but other novel concepts are functioning in the Olympic bubble to combat the spread of the coronavirus.
The Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games outlined many ways robots have taken over responsibilities normally performed by humans. An anti-epidemic robot stands at the entrance to each competition area. The terminal scans QR codes from phones of those entering the venue for health, vaccination and travel records. Even though this process may seem laborious, it only takes two seconds to complete.
The health information is extensive. Games participants are PCR-tested daily and Dr. Brian McCloskey, Chair of the Beijing 2022 Medical Expert Panel has said the testing is “robust and reliable.”
A video on China’s state-run Xinhua News Agency’s website shows the smart restaurant in the media center with robots cooking burgers, fried rice and dumplings. Other robots are acting as baristas or shaking up cocktails. The site has more than 10 types of smart-catering equipment with the most mesmerizing aspect high above diners’ heads. Once an order is ready, it goes on a serving dish and takes a journey on a track system mounted to the ceiling. After locating the person who placed the order, it drops down using a contraption that looks similar to those arcade claw games. I’m hopeful people’s chances are better to receive their order than it is to win a stuffed animal in that arcade game.
Robots are keeping venues clean as well. An atomization disinfection robot in use can sterilize 377 square feet in one minute. Beijing is also using ultraviolet disinfection robots to make sure competition areas are germ free.
Another robot acts as an automated temperature-taking tattletale. These robots can approach people and measure their body temperatures. If the reading is abnormal, the robot will tell the person and then report the situation to staff. The person with the abnormal temperature will be tested again with a mercury thermometer after a short break. If the person’s temperature is still high, they will need to go to a designated area for health screening and consultation with medical staff, according to The Playbook for the 2022 Olympics. Remember, everyone at the games is tested daily with results available and scannable via the My 2022 app required for all visitors.
Something else that measures an athlete’s health statistics is their bed. The smart beds have sensors that can collect health data such as heart rate and breathing according to China’s Global Times. They also reported a member of the management team for the Zhangjiakou Winter Olympic Village told another Chinese news outlet, “The coaches will be noted if there are any data differences.” Seems like that could be a bit invasive, although American luger Summer Britcher posted on TikTok that the beds seemed like a way for Beijing to one-up Tokyo and were “phenomenal.”
Robots doing everything from collecting garbage to dispensing hand sanitizer in the Beijing bubble may have had an impact. Despite its best efforts, the country of China hasn’t had a day of zero COVID cases since October, according to Nikkei Asia. Consider that health officials have performed more than 1.2 million screening tests for people participating in the Beijing Games and have only seen a total positive case count of less than 500.

- Vaccines also protect people from the BA.2 variant in a similar manner to how they protect those with the omicron variant, per Reuters.
What they’re saying: “Looking at other countries where BA.2 is now overtaking, we’re not seeing any higher bumps in hospitalization than expected,” Dr. Boris Pavlin, a member of the WHO’s COVID-19 response team.
- “Vaccination is profoundly protective against severe disease, including for omicron. BA.2 is rapidly replacing BA.1. Its impact is unlikely to be substantial, although more data are needed,” he added.
Details: Scientists recently discovered a fast-moving subvariant of the omicron variant — called BA.2, or “stealth omicron.”
- The subvariant has accounted for more and more COVID-19 cases, leading to new surges in Denmark, the United Kingdom, Singapore and India, as I reported for the Deseret News.

Yes, but: Experts told USA Today that there isn’t any reason to panic yet about the new subvariant.
- “I don’t think it’s going to cause the degree of chaos and disruption, morbidity and mortality that BA.1 did,” Dr. Jacob Lemieux, an infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, told USA Today. “I’m cautiously optimistic that we’re going to continue to move to a better place and, hopefully, one where each new variant on the horizon isn’t news.”",2022-02-03T00:00:00Z,2022,1,12

Positive tests for COVID-19 are “definitely heading in the direction of recovery,” dropping 52% since Jan. 21 when all results are included, Erin Clouse, U. Health strategic engagement manager, told reporters during a virtual news conference.
But Clouse cautioned despite being on the other side of the peak in cases driven by the incredibly transmissible omicron variant, “we’re still at really high rates across our state,” comparable to what Utah saw in 2020 and exceeding last fall’s case counts, when the delta variant made the Intermountain West the nation’s hot spot for the virus.
So while Clouse said overall hospitalizations in the state are down 46% since Jan. 27, from a high of well over 800 during the omicron surge, the current number of patients is still close to what happened during previous peaks over the two years of the pandemic.
Later Tuesday, the Utah Department of Health reported 415 people are currently hospitalized with the virus in Utah, with a total of 2,068 new cases and 13 additional deaths over the long Presidents Day weekend, including one death that occurred prior to Jan. 22.
Dr. Kencee Graves, U. Health associate chief medical officer for inpatient health, said COVID-19 continues to have an impact on both providers and patients.
“Things are stressful here in the hospital,” Graves said. “This morning, we only have a few open acute care beds and many people might need those beds. Our ERs are busy, as are our acute care units. So I would say while COVID may be waning in our community, we still do see effects here in the hospital.”
There are both direct and indirect effects of COVID-19, she said, on patients “who have worsening mental health, who have worsening physical health, who have delayed care, who had a surgery postponed,” as well as on the medical staff who’ve have had to handle the trauma associated with the virus day in and day out.
Stephen Goldstein, a postdoctoral researcher at the U. School of Medicine, said new variants can be expected to emerge “over the course of the next several years and beyond.” So far, he said there’s only been a “slight increase” in the omicron subvariant known as BA.2 to scientists and dubbed “stealth” omicron by others.
“At this point, we’re not experiencing a new wave of infections as a result of this subvariant. We’ll see if that continues to be the case,” Goldstein said, noting it’s already become more prevalent and even dominant in some parts of the world.
The number of BA.2 cases sequenced from positive COVID-19 test samples by the Utah Department of Health laboratory has increased to 21 as of Tuesday, up from seven last week. The subvariant was first detected in Utah in January.
The update was the first from a health care system since Gov. Spencer Cox said Friday that between now and the end of March, the Utah Department of Health would discontinue COVID-19 testing for all but the most vulnerable Utahns as well as daily reports on the virus’ spread.
The governor said the shift in the state’s pandemic response to what he called “a manageable risk model,” where it’s up to Utahns to decide for themselves whether they need to wear a mask, social distance or get vaccinated, does not mean the end of COVID-19, and the state would be ready to respond to future outbreaks.
Graves said Tuesday she’d leave it up to the state to answer whether the state is on track to be able to treat COVID-19 like an endemic disease by March 31. Endemic doesn’t necessarily mean a disease has become less deadly, only that outbreaks are limited compared to the worldwide surges seen in a pandemic.
“Most of us recognize now that COVID-19 is not going to go away, that we are going to have to find a way to live with it and mitigate risk,” Graves said, adding, the university is looking at “how can we best start to recover and be able to move toward what might look like a new normal. I can’t comment on pandemic versus endemic.”
Utah lawmakers all but declared the pandemic was over in the spring of 2021, with legislation that ended a statewide mask mandate and made it difficult for local authorities to impose one. When Salt Lake and Summit counties tried at the peak of the omicron surge, lawmakers overturned their mandates.
Now, nearly every other state is ending mask and vaccine mandates, actions that Graves said make the risk of getting COVID-19 “potentially high” especially among Utahns who are not vaccinated and boosted against the virus. Just 26.5% of all Utahns have gotten both the initial doses and a booster shot.
“We are going to need to be a little flexible as we move forward,” she said.
Goldstein said masks and social distancing will “continue to be important tools that we can use on an individual basis to mitigate our risks.” An N95 mask might make sense during a wave of the virus, he said but “there will be other times when cases are quite low when you can not have to worry too much about that.”
The same is true of eating in restaurants and going to events like concerts, Goldstein said.
“It’s really going to come down, I think from this point forward, to personal risk calculations,” he said. “I think personally those tools will still have an important role to play in times when the circulation of the virus is high, but I also think that hopefully that will be a less constant concern.”

https://www.deseret.com/2022/4/15/23026773/the-front-lines-of-america-first-roger-stone-trump-gop-florida-conservative-politics-desantis-2024/,How Florida became the front lines of ‘America First’,Deseret News,2022-04-16T04:00:00Z,"1: Roger Stone’s strike
When Roger Stone arrived at Strikes, a South Florida lounge situated in one of Boca Raton’s many downtown parking lots, he stood out like a hanging chad. The political consultant and former Trump adviser had been scheduled to speak before a group of several dozen men. Most came in T-shirts, and most of those read: “ROGER STONE DID NOTHING WRONG.” But Stone strolled in wearing a gray three-piece suit with widely pleated pant legs and even wider lapels. For anyone playing I Spy, Stone offered an easy cheat; he was the guy with an actual pocket watch.
The guests had paid $75 to see Stone, who showed up several hours late to his own party. But there wasn’t much question that he’d come. For the past three years, Stone has been on a fundraising campaign to bankroll his legal expenses, after a grand jury indicted him for, among other things, making false statements to Congress. Following his arrest, Stone solicited contributions via crowdsourced legal funds, several live events and even Cameo, until former President Donald Trump pardoned him in late 2020. For a time, it seemed Stone’s financial woes were waning. But a combination of civil suits, medical expenses and a deposition before the Jan. 6 committee, in which he pleaded the Fifth to every question, put him back on the hunt. In December, Stone auctioned off an non-fungible token of a Trump-autographed cover of Real Estate New York.
I was in Florida to write this dispatch from the state which, as Vanity Fair’s Joe Hagan argued recently, has “reshaped the conservative vision of America in the age of Trump.” During his presidency, Trump openly elevated South Florida to a second capital: entertaining diplomats at Mar-a-Lago and occupying Palm Beach with armies of Secret Service. Florida already housed much of his informal Cabinet — Laura Ingraham, Tucker Carlson, Lou Dobbs, Chris Ruddy, Matt Gaetz, Mark Levin, Brad Parscale, Dan Bongino, Laura Loomer and two Koch brothers all have homes here — and some of his actual advisers, like Wilbur Ross and Rudy Giuliani. Since then, several more supporters have joined: Sean Hannity bought a $5.3 million Palm Beach mansion; Jared and Ivanka Trump spent five times that on a waterfront estate; Ben Shapiro relocated from Los Angeles; Fox News contributor Lisa Boothe fled New York mid-pandemic; her colleague Karol Markowitz followed, penning a “Goodbye to All That”-style explainer in the pages of the New York Post.
The rationales vary: Florida’s lockdown rules are lax and, more importantly, income tax is nonexistent. Right-wing figures aren’t the only ones to notice this; as a stern representative for Carlson and Hannity told me by phone: “Joe Scarborough and Mika Brezinski also moved their studio there.” And tech workers have flocked south in droves, thanks in part to Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, who publicly wooed a Peter Thiel-backed venture capital firm to town in late 2020. But it’s inarguable that, among certain characters in the Trump extended universe, a South Florida ZIP code has become a kind of status symbol.
The right’s Florida transplants are hardly pioneers. Conservative pundits Rush Limbaugh, Bill O’Reilly, Matt Drudge and Ann Coulter all blogged or broadcast from the Sunshine State when Trump was still a local punchline. But the recent concentration of MAGA acolytes, paired with the state’s present national influence, represents a significant break with the country club conservatism of former Gov. Jeb Bush; his successor, Charlie Crist, who left the party in 2010; and many current members of the GOP’s establishment wing. The newer crop of Florida right-wingers are less hawkish neocon than populist “NatCon” — nationalist conservatives whose interventionist impulses lie mostly in the culture war. Just last November hundreds of them descended on Orlando for the second NatCon conference, an offshoot of a 3-year-old think tank dedicated to “revitaliz(ing) conservatism for the age of nationalism already upon us.”
Stone has been here for much of the shakeup. His local maneuvering goes back to the “Brooks Brothers riot” during the presidential recount in 2000, so-called for its composition of mainly, as The Wall Street Journal put it, “50-year-old white lawyers with cellphones and Hermès ties.” Stone spent decades as the consummate party insider — advising campaigns for Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush — but he styled himself as a wily outsider for much of the last two decades, flirting with third parties throughout the 2000s and defecting for the Libertarians in 2012, before returning to the voter registry as, in his words, a “Rand Paul Republican.” In the midterms, the GOP will confront both Democrats and the schisms within their own ranks — and Stone, the so-called creator of Trump’s success, has been egging on a coup.
At Strikes that night, Stone offered his own vision of the country. The speech was aimed at liberals, but corporate conservatives were not exempt. “There is a dichotomy,” Stone later explained to a circle of men, “between the party leaders, who are just interested in lining their pockets” and “the grassroots.” If this had once been Jeb Bush’s state party, he argued, it became Trump’s when he beat both Bush and Marco Rubio in the 2016 primaries, and in 2020, when he converted more Hispanic voters in Florida than any Republican before him. “The Florida party is a middle-class, working-class party. It’s been transformed,” Stone claimed. “The weak-kneed, feckless, lily-livered, white wine-swilling, country club-belonging Republicans — they’re a tiny minority.”
Hence his prediction: “A lot of their candidates are going to get beat.”
“There is a dichotomy,” Stone said, “between the party leaders, who are just interested in lining their pockets” and “the grassroots.”
2: RINO hunting
A close cousin of the “weak-kneed, feckless, lily-livered, white wine-swilling, country club-belonging Republican” Stone described — and a term yelled several times during his speech — is the RINO, or “Republican In Name Only.” The acronym goes back to the Teddy Roosevelt administration, but it didn’t enter the political mainstream until the early 1990s, when a New Hampshire political reporter used it to describe Republicans cooperating with Bill Clinton. By the “Republican Revolution’’ of 1994, when the GOP regained control of Congress for the first time in decades, it had become a common dig for the party’s most traitorous members — as had “RINO hunting,” for the process of kicking them out.
The problem with RINO hunting is that its targets can be tricky to spot; no one identifies as a RINO. The label is, as PBS put it back in 2004, “in the eye of the beholder,” and the beholders do not always agree on what they’re seeing. In the ’90s, RINOs were Republicans who defied Grover Norquist’s tax pledge. But as the party evolved, so did the RINOs. In recent years, the label has been stamped on anyone who failed to adopt the carnival-barker effect of Trump-era conservatism. A running list would have to include Paul Ryan, Liz Cheney and Mitt Romney, but also stalwarts like Lindsey Graham, Greg Abbott, Mitch McConnell, and Florida’s own Rick Scott and Marco Rubio. To some degree, the modern RINO is anyone who clashes with Trump. But even he is not immune. “I voted for Trump in 2020,” read The Hill headline in October. “He proved to be the ultimate RINO in 2021.”
Stone isn’t the only observer to suggest RINOs are at risk. On Telegram, the messaging app where Republicans banned from Twitter often find refuge, Trump himself recently warned that RINOs were approaching extinction “as we elect strong Patriots who love America.” Far-right influencer Laura Loomer echoed the sentiment. “2022,” she wrote, “is going to be a bloodbath for RINO incumbents.” But the Florida GOP seems split on who, exactly, should be watching their back. Longtime Floridian Ann Coulter has a theory, though when I emailed her, she declined to discuss it. Actually, she used different words:
“HELLO! I salute you for a story idea that requires you to visit Florida! Everybody’s moving to Florida. Here are some more Florida based stories for you: ‘tech moving to Florida;’ ‘billionaires moving to Florida;’ ‘middle class moving to Florida;’ ‘Greenwich moving to Florida;’ ‘hedge funds moving to Florida;’ ‘Chicagoans moving to Florida;’ ‘young people moving to Florida;’ ‘Stallone moving to Florida;’ etc.
The only people not moving to Florida are the ones who ‘BELIEVE IN SCIENCE!™’ Please warn readers: Gov. DEATH-Santis does not believe in science!’ No masks in schools — and he’s BRAINWASHING school children to love America, the sicko.”
But suffice to say, the right-wing author agrees with the spirit of The Hill headline. Coulter soured on Trump when the border wall fell through, and in a January blog post titled “The Message in the Polls: Trump’s Done,” she argued that most Americans had, too. She prefers his would-be successor DeSantis — one of many mini-Trumps angling for a national profile by channeling the former president’s style. “For months now,” Coulter wrote, “Trump’s been playing the aging silent film star Norma Desmond in ‘Sunset Boulevard’ to DeSantis’ younger, prettier Betty Schaefer.”
DeSantis, an uneasy speaker with a stiff smile, is a hard person to place in the RINO taxonomy. The 43-year-old has neocon credentials: after graduating Yale and Harvard Law School, he joined the Navy, worked at Guantanamo and deployed to Iraq with a SEAL team as the commander’s legal adviser. But he rode tea party momentum into the House of Representatives in 2012 and quickly joined the more radical wing of the party. DeSantis helped found the Freedom Caucus in 2015 and tea party groups backed him when he mulled a Senate run that year. On paper, DeSantis leans deep red, but if RINOs include anyone disloyal to Trump, his track record is rocky. In the 2016 primaries, DeSantis refused to endorse him over Rubio; he came around only to support “the Republican nominee.”
“The problem with RINO hunting is that its targets can be tricky to spot; no one identifies as a RINO. The label is “in the eye of the beholder,” and the beholders do not always agree on what they’re seeing.”
Stone disagrees with Coulter’s analysis. “Ann is a very good friend of mine,” he told me. “I don’t know that she’s a great political strategist.” A few weeks earlier, Stone had taken to Telegram to call DeSantis a “Yale Harvard fat boy (who) can’t get out of his own way.” That wasn’t new; Stone has publicly criticized DeSantis many times; he believes the governor owes his office to Trump. In 2018, only Trump endorsed DeSantis over establishment favorite Adam Putnam, despite his low poll numbers. “Ron DeSantis was an unknown, undistinguished congressman with a bad haircut and an ill-fitting suit who’s not exactly a warm and fuzzy campaigner,” Stone explained. “That’s why Trump had to come back here in the last two weeks and drag him over the finish line.”
Over the past year in particular, DeSantis has become a polarizing figure among the Florida GOP, largely for his own success. The governor’s opposition to pandemic lockdown regulations won him COVID-19-skeptic fans across the state and country; he is now a clear contender for the 2024 presidential primary. But while many possible candidates have said they would drop out if Trump ran, DeSantis has not. Trump has noticed. In January, Axios reported that the former president had been trashing DeSantis in private, claiming he has “no personal charisma and a dull personality.” Trump typically gave DeSantis a “pop in the nose,” one source said, “in the context of the 2024 election.” In public, these tensions emerge only as subtext. Trump, who is vaccinated, recently grouched over “gutless” politicians who won’t say if they’ve gotten a booster — a subtle swipe at DeSantis, who avoided confirming whether he’d received a third shot. The governor denied animosity but dealt it back; he told the “Ruthless” podcast he should have been “much louder” about Trump’s lockdowns in the early pandemic.
Few besides Coulter are ready to dispense with Trump, at least publicly. Her distaste for the former president has put her on the outs with her media peers; last year, she skipped town with fellow skeptic Matt Drudge. (“Drudge and I are both leaving Florida,” Coulter told Vanity Fair, “and we’re not telling anyone where we’re going this time.”) But even Stone does not entirely discount the governor. Did DeSantis represent the country club RINOs, I asked, or the Florida grassroots? “I think he is very shrewd,” Stone said. “He sees where the party is headed, and so therefore, he’s headed that way himself.”
3: Where the boys are
On a Sunday in January, I went to one place the party was headed. In this case, it was the Fort Lauderdale beach at the intersection of A1A, a scenic highway along Florida’s eastern coast, and Las Olas Boulevard, a commercial strip that once housed both Lucille Ball and Dan Quayle. This intersection is best known for the Elbo Room, a two-story art deco bar where anyone can hear electronic dance music at lunchtime. It’s been a spring break hot spot since the 1960 comedy “Where the Boys Are” was filmed on-site but has occasionally made news for other reasons. And last April, it hosted the “Million Maskless March” — a “celebration of freedom” where lockdown skeptics burned masks in an aluminum baking pan.
The march had been organized by a bar mitzvah DJ named Chris Nelson, and now, he’d planned a sequel — a “Defeat the Mandates” rally, modeled on the larger protest in D.C. that day. The Million Maskless March was more like a hundred maskless march, and this one was even smaller. Unlike the capital, masks are somewhat irrelevant in Florida, outside of certain schools and public facilities. The only time I was told to wear one was on my flight, and even that seemed optional (“I’m not wearing a mask and I’ll tell you why,” the pilot said over the loudspeaker. “It’s because I’m Irish and you’ll never understand me”). Vaccinations, however, are required for many jobs. And for the crowd assembled along the sand, this amounted to “tyranny becom(ing) law,” as one sign put it, an authoritarian plot orchestrated by, per another sign, “genocidal satanic sociopaths.” The latter appeared beside twin portraits of Anthony Fauci and Bill Gates.
The politics of the protest were spelled out on posters (“Masks make us sick”), flags (“Let’s Go, Brandon”), and graphic tees (“Florida First, like America First but with attitude”) — and several congressional candidates showed up for precisely that reason. Rubin Young, a diminutive ex-union leader running against Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, scurried around in a black fedora and Spider-Man backpack. Darlene Swaffar, a Stone-endorsed insurance agent vying for the seat that will be vacated by Rep. Ted Deutch, advertised her “America First” platform with a hat that spelled it in rhinestones. Her primary opponent, Dr. Steven Chess, was also there, though not in the crowd. Chess spent the afternoon driving down the strip in a trailer covered in text. The one legible line read: “Had Enough Crazy?”
But few politicians featured as prominently as Trump and DeSantis. And if the two were at odds, none of the activists seemed to know. “I haven’t heard anything about it,” said Saritza Varela, a field organizer with the Republican Party of Florida. Varela had campaigned for Trump in 2020; she was there organizing for the governor’s reelection bid. “I love them both,” she said, “because they love America.” A real estate appraiser named John Rodemeyer, who’d biked from his condo for the protest, agreed. “I think that’s probably promoted by others,” he scoffed. “I don’t think they really are.”
It’s possible they’d missed the news; few attendees read or trusted any media. Rodemeyer only browsed outlets “that affirm (his) beliefs,” which included just three websites (the Drudge Report-knockoff, Citizens Free Press; the anarcho-capitalist site, Lew Rockwell; and Gary North — a blog by the “radical libertarian” and Christian reconstructionist.”) An older couple named Tony and Gina, who’d come wearing flags as capes, said they “can’t watch anything” — not local news, not even Fox. “They all lie,” Gina said. Instead, they follow several social media accounts. “We’ll make up our own minds,” Tony added, “about what we want to believe and what we don’t.”
But perhaps the reports simply did not stick. Trump’s ability to brush off bad press is unrivaled, but DeSantis comes close. That may explain how both are so popular here, in spite of their stances on vaccines. Trump has spent the past year championing the jabs these protesters refused to take. In January, he released an ad that celebrated his role in producing a “vaccine in record time, saving millions of lives.” And DeSantis, while cagey about his own booster, is fully vaccinated. He even released a statement promising the “necessary” doses for Floridians. “While the manner of distribution may change,” he wrote, “the necessity of the booster shot will not.”
DeSantis didn’t upset the protesters. He had opposed mandates; he was “here to guide us,” said Ashton Beaudry, an activist with Moms for America who’d quit her job at Longhorn Steakhouse over its mask requirement. DeSantis is “100% leader,” she yelled into a megaphone, a true “alpha male.” Her husband, Joseph Cyr, a guy with a deep baritone, was “deeply bothered” by Trump’s booster. He wasn’t sure he would vote for him again. But Cyr was an outlier. When I asked Stone about Trump’s stance on vaccines, he smirked. “What’s interesting is, based on an enormous amount of polling, Republicans know that Trump is full-vaccination, but it doesn’t hurt his standing,” he said, “They’re still for him.”
4: Dog racing
Cyr’s Trump-skepticism was only partly about the booster. Mostly, he had lost faith in the electoral system. “Basically the Chinese stole my vote and turned it into a Biden vote,” he told me. How did China do that? “They sent signals, which was caught by the United States military,” Cyr explained. “Everybody knows they cheated. You should look it up.” He took down my email and promised to send proof; I haven’t heard from him.
There is no proof of Chinese vote tampering, because it didn’t happen. DeSantis himself has maintained that Florida had a secure election (“It was transparent. It was fair,” he said in February). And yet the specter of voter fraud has become doctrine to some in the GOP. When Rep. Gaetz voted to challenge the 2020 election results, he claimed “fraud was systemic” and “repeated”; Sen. Scott informed Congress that Democrats were attempting a “hostile federal takeover of American elections”; Stone told me that Florida alone had “1.6 million phantom voters on the rolls” (it does not). Even DeSantis, despite defending his state count, has spent six months touting a proposal to form an “election crimes and security” force. If passed, the $5.7 million bill would station 52 cops across Florida to watch for “ballot harvesting.”
But even those on the right who believe the system is rigged have not been acting like it. When I sat in on a strategy meeting for an “America First” candidate vying for a long-held Democrat seat, she told her team to encourage mail-in ballots. “While the Republican Party pushes negatively on vote by mail, the Democrats capitalize on it,” she told the group assembled in the lobby of her insurance clinic. “If we do not take a page from the Democrats’ book, we will not win.”
But they were sending anyone ballots, a man called from the back. They weren’t even checking ID! Other voices chimed in: Vote by mail was rigged! Could they even trust it? “Stop it,” the candidate said. “Regardless of what you think, you’ve got to stop it.” The goal was to win this year, she said. Then they could go back, and “figure out how to fix 2020 and all the fraud.”

This mysterious virus is spreading (again) among bats in South Africa,Deseret News,2022-01-29T16:00:00Z,"Scientists from Wuhan, China, recently discovered the NeoCoV coronavirus — which has a high death rate and transmission rate — is spreading through bats in South Africa.
What is NeoCov?: Per Business Insider, NeoCoV is a virus connected to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS COV).
- One in three people infected could die from NeoCoV.
- The virus was first found in a bat population and has been known to spread among animals.
- The NeoCoV has traits from both MERS-CoV and the COVID-19-causing SARS-CoV-2
Driving the news: A new study — published on preprint and has not been peer-reviewed — has found that antibodies that target both SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, and MERS-CoV, can’t stop NeoCoV.
- “Our studies have shown that the current COVID-19 vaccinations are inadequate to protect humans from the eventuality of the infection caused by this virus,” researchers said about the virus, according to Business Insider.
Remember: NeoCoV is not new. It was first discovered in 2012 and 2015 in Middle Eastern countries. It has striking similarities to SARS-CoV-2 (the novel coronavirus) in humans.
What’s next: Scientists said they’re unsure what’s next with NeoCoVand if it will pose a threat to humans in the near future.
- “Whether the virus detected in the study will pose a risk for humans will require further study,” the World Health Organization told Russian news agency TASS.
- The virus is reportedly one mutation away from being a major threat to humans.",2022-01-29T16:00:00Z,2022,1,12

Larry Hogan announced additional COVID-19 emergency actions on Tuesday as COVID-19 cases surge and testing becomes troublesome.
- “As I announced last week, we are continuing to closely monitor the rise in COVID-19 hospitalizations and use every tool at our disposal to make sure our hospitals have the resources they need to prepare for this and future surges,” said Hogan.
The governor issued a 30-day state of emergency, in addition to two executive orders — the first gives the state health secretary the ability to regulate hospital personnel, bed space and supplies, which includes transferring patients.
- It also allows interstates health care licenses to be used, inactive health care practitioners to practice and graduate nurses to work at health care facilities.
The second order states that 20 additional COVID-19 testing sites will open across the state, assisted by 1,000 Maryland National Guard members, who will also aid hospitals.
- “These are important actions,” said Hogan, “but getting vaccinated or boosted continues to be the single most important thing Marylanders can do to protect against these dangerous COVID-19 variants.”

Per Fox News, Baltimore, Maryland saw more than 14,000 new cases in one day with over 3,000 hospitalizations.
- “Our hospitals are struggling to deal with the numbers of sick people coming to them. As of yesterday (Monday) afternoon, more than 600 patients were waiting at emergency departments for their turn to be admitted to a hospital bed. In fact, our emergency departments are as busy as they’ve ever been,” said Dr. Ted Delbridge, executive director of the Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services Systems, per WBAL-TV 11 News.
- “The next four to six weeks will be the most challenging time of the entire pandemic,” Hogan said, referencing hospitalization numbers that could reach 5,000. “While we are hoping for the best, we are actively preparing for the worst.”",2022-01-04T19:39:15Z,2022,1,12

However, as the months of this pandemic have continued, our number of cases has heightened and Utah has been among the top five states for high COVID transmission several times. He has chosen politics over health. I am confused and saddened with his change of heart and letting this become a political issue versus a health Issue.
Haven’t we learned from the past that mandated safety and health measures save lives? Seatbelt laws, school vaccination requirements, age restrictions for purchasing alcohol and tobacco are just a few mandated measures that have served that purpose. Polio was not politicized but eradicated. Is that not what we want for the COVID virus?
Where is the freedom for those who are dying? Where is the freedom for those who have complied with health and vaccination recommendations? Freedom of choice in a public heath situation does not mean you are free. The consequences don’t affect an individual but a community.
How could Cox possibly think that not mandating masks in, of all places, government offices, wouldn’t be the reasonable thing to do considering the health crisis we are experiencing?

What you need to know about this respiratory virus season,Deseret News,2022-11-16T22:14:16Z,"What’s being called a “tripledemic” of respiratory viruses is hitting Utah and other parts of the country hard right now.
The trio — COVID-19, RSV or respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza — are spreading much faster than normal, doctors warn, with RSV and flu cases already filling Primary Children’s Hospital “to the brim,” delaying some surgeries and outpatient procedures. Adults, too, are being hospitalized with RSV.
Even COVID-19 cases are once again climbing, thanks to ever more highly transmissible versions of the omicron variant that sent cases soaring to record levels last winter and forced overwhelmed hospitals to turn away some patients.
Can you catch multiple viruses at the same time?
The definition of “tripledemic” is actually pretty simple.
“We’re talking about those three viruses all circulating at higher levels than we’re used to at this stage of a respiratory season,” said Dr. Brandon Webb, an associate professor of infectious diseases with Intermountain Healthcare.
But that doesn’t mean most people are likely to get all of them all at once.
“We’re generally not talking about one individual having more than one of these viruses at the same time. It can happen, but it’s not the norm,” Webb said. “The norm is that these viruses tend to be a one-at-a-time phenomenon.”
There are exceptions, he said, especially in patients who are immunocompromised due to cancer treatments, organ transplants or underlying conditions that can be genetic. Newborns and infants also can have multiple viruses at the same time, Webb said.
Why are RSV and the flu such a concern now?
For the past two winters, public health precautions taken during the COVID-19 pandemic helped bring RSV and the flu to nearly a standstill. But both of the sometimes deadly viruses have come back now that most people are no longer routinely wearing a mask or taking other measures that slow the spread of respiratory illnesses.
There’s also what Webb called “the immunity gap,” caused by a lack of recent exposure to the two viruses.
“What that means is that in normal circumstances, in a non-pandemic environment, these seasonal viruses spread through the community each year and they affect a wide swath of people,” Webb said, “some who have exposure but no symptoms, some who have very mild symptoms and some who have more severe symptoms.”
Each season, that allows people to develop some immunity to RSV and flu viruses, the doctor said.
“That repeated exposure, season over season, generates sort of a constant background of immunity in a population,” Webb said, although it ends up being “incomplete because immunity to respiratory viruses doesn’t last very long.”
The short-lived protection from an infection is “the same phenomenon that we’ve been frustrated with, with COVID, where the immunity wanes over time, is true for immunity to RSV and influenza, and the croup virus as well,” he said.
Still, there’s enough immunity generated overall that it “primes the pump to some degree and establishes this background level of partial immunity so less people are fully non-immune as the next wave, the next season, comes on,” Webb said.
Why this respiratory virus season is different
It’s all about the immunity gap.
“What we’re seeing this year is the consequences of having two respiratory viral seasons in a row where we had very, very low rates of RSV and influenza. So the partial immunity has waned tremendously,” he said. “Many, many people who had been exposed, or had some partial immunity in years past don’t have that anymore.”
That lack of immunity is driving the early peaks in RSV and flu cases, Webb said.
The immunity gap has also made getting an annual flu shot even more important this year, health experts have said. There isn’t an RSV vaccine yet, but staying up to date on COVID-19 vaccinations is also recommended, including the updated booster dose targeted at omicron subvariants.
Because the viruses can cause severe disease in the very young and the very old, as well as those with certain medical conditions, Webb advised anyone with even mild cold symptoms to take precautions like wearing a mask and avoiding contact with the vulnerable.
“There’s just a lot of overlap between these virus,” the doctor said, making it difficult to know without testing if what seems like a cold is something more serious. “No matter what you’re sick with, one thing we’ve learned from the pandemic is it’s really important to protect others.”",2022-11-16T22:14:16Z,2022,4,12
https://www.deseret.com/2022/9/18/23356915/aaron-rodgers-immunization-comments/,"The controversy over Aaron Rodgers and COVID-19 vaccines, explained",Deseret News,2022-09-18T15:00:00Z,"Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers may have lost his favorite receiver, Davante Adams, to the Las Vegas Raiders during the offseason, but he gained a much more lenient set of COVID-19 rules.
Rodgers and other unvaccinated players are no longer subject to mandatory testing. Additionally, the isolation period after a positive test is now less than one week long.
“Players, however, must self-report symptoms and show a negative test before entering team facilities. If they test positive ... they must self-isolate for five days,” Sporting News reported in August.
Rodgers praised these changes and others during his Sept. 2 appearance on “The Pat McAfee Show,” while also criticizing the NFL’s past approach to the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Us non-vax guys went through hell last year,” he said.
Rodgers’ unvaccinated status fueled one of the major scandals of the 2021 NFL season. After he contracted COVID-19 in early November and faced a mandatory absence from team activities, reporters realized that his statements from earlier in the season about being “immunized” had been intentionally misleading.
“Rodgers (had) pursued an alternative treatment and then petitioned the NFL to recognize him as vaccinated. The NFL refused,” ESPN reported in November 2021.
During an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast this summer, Rodgers reiterated that he would have said more about what he meant by “immunized” in August 2021 if reporters had thought to ask. (He was using the word to refer to a homeopathic treatment.)
The quarterback also said that an allergy to polyethylene glycol prevented him from receiving the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, as the SB Nation site Acme Packing Co. reported in its summary of Rodgers’ Rogan appearance.
That article noted that the NFL likely rejected Rodgers’ effort to sidestep its vaccination since he still could have gotten the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.
The NFL and NFL Players Association jointly agreed to do away with most COVID-19 safety rules in March, according to NFL.com.",2022-09-18T15:00:00Z,2022,3,12
https://www.deseret.com/2022/9/7/23340108/biden-censoring-facebook-twitter-attorney-general-lawsuit-social-media/,Newly released emails show coordination between social media companies and Biden administration on COVID information,Deseret News,2022-09-07T15:35:16Z,"Top-ranking Biden administration officials appear to have pressured Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms to censor content the federal government considered misinformation, according to federal government emails obtained by two Republican state attorneys general.
The emails, procured in a federal lawsuit filed by Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt and Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, detail months of apparent coordination between federal administration officials and social media giants on how to address information regarding COVID-19.
“The discovery provided so far demonstrates that this censorship enterprise is extremely broad,” Schmitt and Landry said in a joint statement. The lawsuit’s discovery identified 45 federal officials who communicated with social media executives on what information to censor.
The new revelations add to questions on whether it was appropriate for social media fact-checkers to censor contrarian views, even inside America’s scientific community.
Facebook, for example, affixed a “Missing Context” label to Johns Hopkins surgeon Marty Makary’s Wall Street Journal op-ed, which was on how social media companies put their thumb on the scale in scientific debates over COVID-19. When questioned, the social media giant’s fact-checkers said a team of three scientists disagreed with Dr. Makary’s conclusion. Although it’s not clear if administration officials intervened specifically on Makary’s op-ed, other posts and tweets were directly called out by the White House and removed by social media companies shortly after.
In July of last year, Clarke Humphrey, the White House digital director of the COVID-19 response team, asked an Instagram employee to take down a parody account of Dr. Anthony Fauci.
“Any way we can get this pulled down?” Humphrey wrote in an email. “It is not actually one of ours.” Less than a minute later the Instagram official answers, “Yep, on it!”
The relationship between the administration and social media employees indicated by the email’s familiarity and response time was the product of numerous meetings between federal bureaucrats and the social media companies.
An email from April 2021, discusses a scheduled meeting for Biden staff to be “briefed by Twitter on vaccine misinfo.” Later in the summer, a Facebook official proposes to a Center for Disease Control and Prevention official that “in addition to our weekly meetings, doing a monthly misinfo/debunking meeting, with maybe claim topics communicated a few days prior so that you can bring in the matching experts and chat casually for 30 minutes or so.”
The CDC official responded, “Yes, we would love to do that.” The emails show many instances where Facebook officials wouldn’t go forward on censoring a COVID-19 claim until getting input from the administration’s “debunking team.”
The emails also show social media companies eager to work with the administration. On July 16, 2021, President Joe Biden publicly accused Facebook of “killing people’’ because the company had not taken down misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. A Meta executive (Facebook’s parent company) emailed Surgeon General Vivek Murthy to run damage control after the president’s statement.
“Reaching out after what has transpired ... and culminating today in the President’s remarks about us,” wrote the Meta executive. “I know our teams met today to better understand the scope of what the White House expects from us on misinformation going forward.”
The same Meta executive texted Murthy later that same day. “It’s not great to be accused of killing people,” he wrote, and adding that he was “keen to find a way to deescalate and work together collaboratively.”
The emails show that that is exactly what he did. A week later the Meta executive wrote to a Department of Health and Human Services official where he discussed changing company policies and removing several objectionable pages, groups and accounts spreading what the administration had identified as misinformation.
The attorneys general lawsuit accuses the Biden administration of enacting a speech code that would be unconstitutional if the government tried to impose it themselves.
“Having threatened and cajoled social-media platforms for years to censor viewpoints and speakers disfavored by the Left,” the lawsuit says, “senior government officials in the Executive Branch have moved into a phase of open collusion with social-media companies to suppress disfavored speakers, viewpoints, and content on social media platforms under the Orwellian guise of halting so-called ‘disinformation,’ ‘misinformation,’ and ‘malinformation.’”
Earlier this summer, the Justice Department refused to produce communications between federal government bureaucrats and social media officials. So the Missouri and Louisiana attorneys general filed a petition with the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana to compel the federal government to produce the emails.
The court ruled in favor of the petition resulting in the recently published batch of emails. However, the Department of Justice is claiming “executive privilege” for communications between the highest-ranking Biden administration officials and the social media giants.
“The government has been uncooperative and has resisted complying with the discovery order every step of the way,” a statement reads from the New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA) that is party to the lawsuit against the federal government.
The lawsuit’s revelations have heightened concerns among Republicans.
“Confirming that this is the most dangerously anti-free speech administration in American history AND that Facebook (or Meta or whatever) is nothing but an appendage of the deep state,” Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., posted on his Twitter account.
House Republicans are proposing legislation to stop the Biden administration from coordinating with social media companies on content censorship. The Protecting Speech from Government Interference Act would prohibit federal bureaucrats and other executive branch officials from encouraging private companies to censor or limit speech.",2022-09-07T15:35:16Z,2022,3,12

Here’s how to stay safe against flu, COVID and RSV",Deseret News,2022-12-17T23:30:00Z,"COVID-19 cases are rising again as are hospitalizations, according to estimates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many states continue to recommend masking when in public, although these aren’t mandated as seen during the peak pandemic era.
But coronavirus isn’t the only illness burdening hospitals, which have also seen an uptick in RSV and flu.
“Most of the population — unfortunately — has forgotten about COVID-19 and moved on. As a result, we’re seeing a rise in cases and a rise in hospitalizations, and that worries me,” Ali Mokdad, professor of global health at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, told Politico. “Right now, with the rise of flu, RSV and COVID, our health professionals are exhausted.”
With holidays coming up, it’s crucial to take precautionary steps this winter. Here’s what we know about the viruses spreading in the U.S.
What are the COVID-19 variants circulating in the U.S.?
The coronavirus is expected to go through a series of modifications, Dr. Dean Blumberg, professor and chief of pediatric infectious disease at UC Davis Health, told The Sacramento Bee in January.
“Every time that there’s transmission of the virus, that results in viral replication,” Blumberg said. “It’s an opportunity for new mutations to occur.”
Over the summer, BA.5 was the dominant strain, behind a majority of reported cases, according to the CDC. But new omicron mutations — BQ.1.1 and BQ.1 — now make up nearly 70% of reported cases together.
The BQ.1 mutation is a sublineage of BA.5, carrying spike mutations, according to the World Health Organization. While BQ.1.1 carries an additional spike mutation.
The WHO states that there isn’t enough evidence that proves BQ.1 is more severe than other omicron variants, but it's clear that it has transmission advantages over the other mutations.
The top symptoms to look out for are a sore throat, cough, fatigue, congestion and a runny nose, as I previously reported.
Do vaccines work against omicron subvariants BQ.1 and BQ.1.1?
The Food and Drug Administration approved the bivalent COVID-19 vaccines in August, according to a press release. These updated vaccines target the original coronavirus strain as well as omicron mutations, specifically variants from BA.4 and BA.5 lineages.
Based on the data available, these new vaccines may offer reduced protection but still have the ability to safeguard against a severe infection, according to the WHO.
A recent study found that the updated booster shots generate a weaker response against the newer subvariants, as I previously reported for the Deseret News.
What is RSV?
Respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, is a common virus that usually peaks during wintertime and mimics the symptoms of cold, as I reported for the Deseret News.
But for younger children or older adults, RSV can lead to bronchiolitis or pneumonia. There is no vaccine for it.
There is an immunity gap because of the lack of exposure to this common virus as well as flu.
“What we’re seeing this year is the consequences of having two respiratory viral seasons in a row where we had very, very low rates of RSV and influenza. So the partial immunity has waned tremendously,” Dr. Brandon Webb, an associate professor of infectious diseases with Intermountain Healthcare, told the Deseret News. “Many, many people who had been exposed, or had some partial immunity in years past don’t have that anymore.”
What to know about flu season
This year, flu also proved to burden hospitals with uncharacteristically high number of cases.
“Not only is flu early, it also looks very severe,” said William Schaffner, medical director for the nonprofit National Foundation for Infectious Diseases and a professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, earlier in October, per The Washington Post.
Flu “can spread from respiratory droplets, aerosols and through contaminated surfaces,” per Yale Medicine.
Getting a flu shot is highly recommended, said Dr. Thomas Murray, a Yale Medicine pediatric infectious diseases physician.
But most important of all, if you develop any symptoms, don’t congregate with others, said Murray, adding: “But if you insist, wear a mask and segregate yourself during activities such as eating, when you can’t be masked.”",2022-12-17T23:30:00Z,2022,4,12

They’ve never even visited the region.
But they do have a finished basement apartment in their home in Herriman that a Ukrainian mother and her three children will call home in the coming weeks.
The Atkinsons are among 19,000 others living in the U.S. that have applied to sponsor a Ukrainian family under the Biden administration’s Uniting for Ukraine program, which entered its third week on Monday. The Department of Homeland Security announced over 6,000 people have been approved and made travel arrangements, and the first wave of people admitted under the program are starting to trickle in.
Biden says the U.S. is willing to admit at least 100,000 Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s invasion.
But the administration is taking a new approach to resettlement with Ukrainians, relying on the goodwill of people already legally in the U.S. It’s sponsors — not the government — who will be on the hook for coordinating resettlement and financially supporting Ukrainian refugees.
It’s the largest sponsor-based resettlement program in U.S. history, designed to streamline the process for Ukrainians with friends and family in the U.S. But there’s nothing stopping strangers from sponsoring strangers, the approach taken by people like the Atkinsons.
The family has been slowly stepping out of its comfort zone, hosting family friends from France one year, then foreign exchange students the next.
“We got ourself acclimated to where we said, ‘We can do this,’” said Atkinson. “It’s going to be OK, it’s going to be cool and a little crazy. And that’s fine.”
How the program works
Anyone residing legally in the U.S. can apply to be a financial sponsor for Ukrainian refugees, including other immigrants and green card holders. The application can be found on the Department of Homeland Security’s portal.
- The first step is to find an eligible Ukrainian family. That includes families who fled the country after Feb. 11 or anyone still in Ukraine.
- Next, sponsors fill out an I-134 form, declaring their own income as well as the income of the refugee families they are advocating for.
- Sponsors will then be vetted, and may be required to interview or provide supplementary evidence for their I-134 form.
- Once approved, Ukrainian families will be directed to confirm personal information, provide proof of vaccination for measles, polio and COVID-19, pass background checks and medical screening.
- If they pass, Ukrainians are responsible for their own travel arrangements that will put them in the U.S. within 90 days. They will be granted humanitarian parole, which lasts for two years and creates a pathway to work authorization.
It’s what some experts, like Aden Batar, director of migration and refugee services at Catholic Community Services Salt Lake office, call a tradeoff.
Ukrainians who need an immediate pathway to the U.S. now have one. But humanitarian parolees are not eligible for social programs like food stamps or Medicaid — refugees that come through traditional resettlement pathways are. They also won’t receive the same level of support from resettlement agencies like the International Rescue Committee, or Catholic Community Services.
“It’s going to be hard for someone who lost everything they had, and witnessed all this horrible war trauma and now they’re coming and they will not be eligible (for social programs),” said Batar. “They’re going to need the resettlement agencies’ support so that’s why we’re asking the federal government and Congress to appropriate resources.”
For now, the program is financially dependent on the sponsors, who in their I-134 form need to prove they can provide housing or cash assistance if needed. Batar says Congress could allocate funding so the parolees are eligible for the same benefits available to people with refugee status.
Uniting for Ukraine received 14,500 applicants in the first 10 days, according to The Wall Street Journal, overlapping with many of the 20,000 Ukrainians that attempted to enter the U.S. along the Mexican border.
‘I don’t think it would be possible without social media’
On Tuesday, Melanie Williamson of Salt Lake City spent the afternoon applying to sponsor a family currently living in a refugee camp in Mexico City, who flew there to claim asylum or humanitarian parole, but are now falling back on Uniting for Ukraine.
Williamson reached out to the family via Facebook.
The social media platform is a hub for sponsors connecting with refugees, with Facebook pages like North America for Ukraine ballooning to thousands of members, from Ukraine, the U.S. and Canada, looking to match with each other.
“I don’t think it would be possible without social media,” said Williamson.
Like the Atkinsons, Williamson had no prior ties to Ukraine. But when the war broke out in February, she felt compelled to donate money to aid groups. Then she joined several Facebook groups, and eventually found herself reaching out to strangers thousands of miles away, asking if they needed a sponsor.
“If I had room in my house, I would let people in,” she said, noting that the family won’t be living with her — they’re instead eyeing Austin, Texas.
“But there’s still something really rewarding about helping someone, one on one. I am just one person but I impacted one person,” she said.
Ukrainians cannot apply for humanitarian parole through the program, and instead need to find a sponsor to apply on their behalf. Often refugees will submit what Williamson and other sponsors likened to an online dating profile, describing in detail their journey out of Ukraine and their hobbies, interests and even religious and political views.
“It’s kind of like dating,” Michael Atkinson said. “You can determine a lot about the people who are applying based on their posts.”
Prospective sponsors also create what looks like a rental listing.
“People would post on here saying, ‘I have a home in upstate New York out in the country and I’m looking to host a family.’ And they’ll get all these replies from Ukrainians saying ‘pick me, pick me,’” Atkinson said.
Combing through several Facebook pages, they would see posts from Ukrainian families asking for a sponsor. It wasn’t an easy process — often the people wouldn’t reply, or they realized the family doesn’t need physical housing. But eventually they opened a dialogue with a young mother currently living in Turkey with her three children. In a few weeks, they’ll be landing in Salt Lake City.
Nongovernmental organizations and nonprofits are helping match people in the U.S. with Ukrainians, like Welcome US which will notify sponsors when there are refugees in need. Prospective sponsors have also taken to the community app NextDoor to coordinate.
A future model for resettlement?
Immigration experts say Uniting for Ukraine could be a model for future resettlement efforts.
“There’s always been this conversation about community sponsorship related to refugees — why don’t we have this? How would this work? And towards the end of the Obama years, there was this model,” said Asha Parekh, director of the Utah Office of Refugee Services.
Parekh has mixed feelings on the program. Resettlement is a lengthy process, and getting approved to come to the U.S. is the first step in a yearslong journey that includes finding long-term housing, a career, health care, learning English, child care, education and more.
Some of the guidance that resettlement agencies typically provide won’t be available to Ukrainians with humanitarian parole status. But she says it’s inspiring to see the outpouring of support in a system that has so far proven to be effective.
“This is the first time that (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services) has an application online. And they’ve already approved 6,000 applications, that is remarkable. On the one hand, yes, there are gaps in what they’re doing. On the other hand, they’re doing things they’ve never done before,” she said.
What to expect as more Ukrainians flee war
With the program hinging entirely on sponsors, experts say it’s unlikely the U.S. will resettle 100,000 refugees through Uniting for Ukraine alone.
“I think it’s going to be really impossible for that number to be filled with sponsorships,” said Batar, with Catholic Community Services.
Batar thinks that more people will likely enter the U.S. by way of asylum or the traditional refugee pathway, which can take years.
“I think there’s still some people that are going to benefit from this, those that have relatives or friends (in the U.S.),” he said. “... But a larger number of the people are still stranded, either in Ukraine or neighboring countries, and don’t have any relatives or people to find a sponsorship for them.”
In February, March and April, fewer than 550 Ukrainians were admitted to 25 U.S. states via the country’s refugee resettlement process. Washington state admitted 164, the most in the U.S. — none were resettled in Utah, according to data from the Refugee Processing Center.
The Department of Homeland Security still doesn’t know how many Ukrainians will be resettled through the refugee program. Utah probably won’t see anyone until October, says Parekh.
At least 87% of Beehive State voters support resettling Ukrainian refugees, according to a Deseret News/Hinckley Institute of Politics poll.
Even with the traditional resettlement process, experts say most refugees will opt to stay in neighboring countries — like Poland, Romania or Hungary, which have collectively admitted over 4.5 million Ukrainians — rather than move to the U.S.
“The majority of people prefer to stay close to home. Because at the end of the day, their final goal is to get back home when the situation allows,” said Olga Sarrado, spokesperson for the U.N. Refugee Agency.",2022-05-14T04:00:00Z,2022,2,12

On Friday, Feb. 11, Michael Brandon Demarre was on a Delta flight from Salt Lake City to Oregon, when midflight he attempted to open the airplane’s emergency exit.
Demarre removed the plastic covering on the emergency exit handle, then pulled on it “with his full body weight,” according to court records.
A flight attendant told Demarre to stop, which he did, then directed him to the back of the plane. Demarre was seated and physically restrained, the probable cause statement reads.
Four passengers were then asked to watch Demarre, and prevent him from trying to open the exit again. According to court records, the disturbance required attention from flight attendants for the rest of the trip, and they were unable to perform their regular duties.
Demarre would later tell police that he caused a scene so passengers would film him, giving him a chance to share his thoughts on the COVID-19 vaccine.
What exactly those thoughts were is unclear. But the incident points to a larger trend of COVID-19-related flight disturbances.
Before the pandemic, unruly passengers — defined as a person who interferes with crew members’ jobs or intimidates, threatens or assaults them — were so rare that the Federal Aviation Administration didn’t even track them.
But in 2021, the FAA said it received more than 6,000 reports of unruly behavior, 4,300 of them stemming from mask requirements.
The reports led to more than 1,000 investigations in 2021.
And a survey conducted by the Association of Flight Attendants, a union that represents employees across 17 airlines, found that 85% of flight attendants dealt with unruly passengers in 2021. About 58% dealt with at least five incidents, while 17% experienced a physical incident, a figure the union calls “shocking.”
As of Tuesday, the FAA is reporting 394 reports of unruly passengers in 2022, most of them due to mask concerns. Add Demarre to the list.
The Oregon man is facing charges of interference and attempted interference with flight crew and attendants, and threats to interfere with a flight crew and attendants. Prosecutors say there were no reports that Demarre was intoxicated or on drugs.",2022-02-16T19:54:21Z,2022,1,12

Here’s what we know,Deseret News,2022-09-17T00:00:00Z,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends newly authorized booster shots manufactured by Pfizer and BioNTech.
These new vaccines target not only the original coronavirus strain but omicron as well.
“How high that wave is, and how overwhelmed our hospital systems are, are going to be a direct correlation with how many people get their booster and how this virus mutates,” said Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist, per PBS. “One of those things we can control, and the other one, we can’t.”
So, who should get a new COVID-19 booster shot?
Jetelina told the news outlet that everyone should get a fall booster shot.
“This virus has been mutating so quickly over the past two years,” said Judith Guzman-Cottrill, an infectious disease specialist at Oregon Health & Science University, per NPR. “I feel like we’ve been playing catch up and finally we have caught up,” Guzman-Cottrill says.
Does the new COVID-19 booster shot have any side effects?
There isn’t any data available about the new booster shots as human trials haven’t concluded.
But Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and member of an independent advisory group to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, told CNBC that he “wouldn’t expect the side effects, severity or the safety profile of the shots to be different from the current mRNA vaccines and boosters,”
After examining the side effects from the original vaccine as well as the data acquired through clinical trials of a different bivalent booster that targeted BA.1 subvariant, here are the most commonly reported side effects, per the report:
- Pain.
- Fatigue.
- Headache.
- Muscle pain.
- Chills.
- Joint pain.
- Redness and swelling at the injection site.
- Fever.
“We should keep our eyes wide open to what side effects and adverse events might occur, and still keep in mind that this is a new product,” Offit said.",2022-09-17T00:00:00Z,2022,3,12

- “I think we are in a new phase where we can start to getting back to doing many of the things that we have liked to do and where we have to remain vigilant,” she said.
Yes, but: She said she isn’t sure that COVID-19 is over completely.
- “We certainly hope so. We certainly have a lot of immunity in the population, more and more people getting vaccinated, more and more people getting boosted. We have some immunity from prior infection. But with certainty, we don’t know.”
Why it matters: Experts have been worried that another new COVID-19 variant will emerge soon, as I reported for the Deseret News.
- Local leaders find themselves in a “honeymoon period” with fewer COVID-19 restrictions, but that could end if a new COVID-19 wave begins, experts said.
- Multiple public health experts told The Guardian that local government and health leaders should use the ongoing lull period to prepare for the next COVID-19 outbreak.

One more thought to go: Walensky advised Americans “not to shred” their face masks, but to keep them safe for the future.
- “I would say put your masks in a drawer, anticipate you may need them again and hope that we don’t,” she said.",2022-03-09T17:16:33Z,2022,1,12

Good morning and welcome to On the Trail 2024, the Deseret News’ campaign newsletter. I’m Samuel Benson, Deseret’s national political correspondent.
In case you missed it: Republican presidential long shot Larry Elder told us this week that Vivek Ramaswamy — who stole the spotlight at last week’s debate — stole one of Elder’s lines without attribution. Also, a new poll of Utah GOP voters shows both Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis slipping in the state.
Consider this newsletter to be your formal welcome-back-to-school notice — featuring an inside look at a parents’ rights group with an outsized influence on classrooms and presidential candidates alike.
The Big Idea
Meet ‘Moms for Liberty,’ the new GOP kingmakers
During my commute to work this week, I drove past a long line of children piling into a school bus. ’Tis the season. Parents know the feeling. Presidential candidates do, too — or so they say.
Weaving education policy into stump speeches has become common practice for this election cycle’s crop of candidates. DeSantis blasts “woke indoctrination”; Scott pushes for school choice; Ramaswamy vows to empower parents by shutting down the Education Department altogether. Yet most of the leading candidates have found allies in a new, powerful group of mothers, whose grassroots organization is one of the key powerbrokers in the 2024 race.
“Moms for Liberty” was formed by a group of local school board members during the COVID-19 pandemic. They were concerned with how schools dealt with vaccination, masks and social distancing; now, they’re geared toward training women to run for school boards and on how topics like race, sexuality and gender identity are taught in the classroom.
Tim Scott hosted an event with Moms for Liberty in South Carolina this week, where he rolled out his new education plan. Nikki Haley travels to New Hampshire next week for her own event with co-founder Tiffany Justice. And three other candidates — DeSantis, Trump and Asa Hutchinson — joined Haley and Scott at the Moms for Liberty annual summit in Philadelphia earlier this summer.
As candidates stump on parents’ rights and school choice, Moms for Liberty has become an important ally. The group has fought instruction in schools that it deems “inappropriate” for young children. All parents should have a right to know what and how their child is being taught, they say. “Government schools don’t know their place,” Justice told the Deseret News. “They have encroached upon parental rights, our rights as parents, and now we are redrawing the boundary.”
Such an approach has gained them praise from the right and vitriol from the left, with some going as far as saying that the group’s stance on LGBTQ and racism in the classroom classifies it as an “extremist group.”
“If it’s a ‘hate group,’ add me to the list,” Haley told Fox News.
Don’t expect the group to endorse a candidate — “We endorse only for school board races,” Justice said. But that doesn’t make them any less influential. Issues over parents’ rights are taking center stage this year, with cases in the New Hampshire Supreme Court and the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals pitting school districts against parents who want a larger say in what their children are taught.

Poll pulse
Two interesting polls to share: one about the quality of K-12 education, and another about whether Biden is too old to run for reelection.
Education. Americans’ satisfaction with the quality of K-12 education is at a record low, a new Gallup poll suggests. Only 36% of Americans say they are somewhat or completely satisfied with American education, and for Republicans, that number is even lower: 25%.
However, parents of current K-12 students are much more satisfied, on average, than the American populace writ large; 76% of those who currently have a child in K-12 are satisfied with that child’s quality of education.
Biden. A whopping 77% of American adults think Biden is too old to serve another term as U.S. president, according to a new AP poll. That includes 69% of Democrats.
By contrast, 51% think Trump is too old for reelection.
Biden is 80 years old. Trump is 77.
The poll comes days after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell froze up during a press conference, raising fresh concerns about his health.
Weekend reads
- An insightful column on the parenting divide in America, claiming liberals and conservatives “aren’t arguing over matters of mere prudence anymore but over deep and divisive principles.” It’s an unhealthy dynamic, Michael Brendan Dougherty argues, and we need to find a way out — “because if there is one thing I know, it’s that parents will fight for their children unto the last breath.” “Two American Childhoods” (Dougherty, National Review).
- President Joe Biden is a storyteller. During a recent visit to Utah, he shared anecdotes about his relationships with Jake Garn, Orrin Hatch and Mitt Romney. In Hawaii, he spoke about surviving a house fire. He speaks often about his childhood and his early adulthood. But are all of those stories accurate? “Biden loves to retell certain stories. Some aren’t credible” (Glenn Kessler, The Washington Post).
- And lastly, a fitting read for a long Labor Day weekend: “Why a Big Union Is Snubbing Biden, Doing Industry’s Dirty Work and Creating an Opening for Trump” (Jamie Lincoln Kitman, Politico).
Friday mailbag
Have a question you’d like me to answer in next Friday’s newsletter? Send it along to onthetrail@deseretnews.com. Let’s talk policy, polling, candidates ... anything election-related.
Our most frequent question this week had less to do with the race and more to do with our coverage of it. This is our first Friday mailbag, so why not.
I heard several variations of: How will Deseret’s coverage of the 2024 presidential election be any different from other publications? Also: Is the focus going to be on horse-race coverage, or more about issues and character/fitness for office?
A great question. The first place I point readers is Deseret’s mission statement: to be “trusted voices of light and knowledge.” We hope this informs all of our reporting.
Ours will not be “horse-race” reporting, where we’re obsessed with polls or sound bites. Instead, we’ll prioritize the issues that are important to our readers and coincide with our mission — like faith, family, immigration, education, civility and protecting democracy.
Here are a few examples of how we’ve done this already:
- In an exclusive interview with Vivek Ramaswamy, we chose to focus on refugee policy, something that Ramaswamy hadn’t yet discussed on the record.
- We broke the story of a small, influential group of evangelical pastors who are “vetting” presidential candidates as they pass through Iowa, assuring they maintain a “biblical worldview.”
- In a conversation with Sen. Tim Scott, we asked about his colleague Sen. Mitt Romney, who proposed a plan to have GOP candidates coalesce in order to prevent Trump from winning the nomination.
- Our debate coverage in Milwaukee included a look at a new initiative, geared toward encouraging Republicans to support democracy in Ukraine.
- And lastly, our first two editions of “On the Trail 2024” brought you both exclusive interviews with Asa Hutchinson and Milwaukee’s Democratic mayor — who welcomed the first GOP debate to his city because of his belief that we can “disagree without being disagreeable.”
That said, we’re doing this for our readers — so if you ever feel that our coverage leaves you wanting or doesn’t live up to our mission statement, my inbox is always open (onthetrail@deseretnews.com). I’d love to hear what issues you want us to cover or the questions you want us to ask candidates.
See you on the trail.

https://www.deseret.com/opinion/2023/12/1/23979827/2024-election-races-celeste-maloy-john-curtis/,Opinion: No respite from politics as 2023 ends and 2024 heats up,Deseret News,2023-12-01T16:00:00Z,"We are in the middle of an unprecedented two-month period of political drama. The unique dynamics of late November municipal and special congressional elections, followed quickly by major political events in the upcoming year, leave little time for political junkies to celebrate the holidays. But, somehow, we’ll manage.
Results of the 2nd Congressional District special election and various municipal contests have only recently been finalized due to the late election date. Are there lessons to learn from 2023 as the 2024 election season begins very soon?
Pignanelli: “Everything in life is unusual until you become accustomed to it.” — Frank Baum
What we endured in 2023 heralds a peculiar 2024 election cycle. Rural voters controlled the elections to replace Rep. Chris Stewart, a dynamic which GOP nominee Celeste Maloy focused on with resounding success. Thus, 2024 federal and statewide candidates will direct more attention to energized voters off the Wasatch Front who could play a decisive role in multicandidate primaries.
Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall was opposed by individual challengers and well-financed special interest organizations. They attempted to create discomfort among voters with numerous attacks ads claiming the capital city was a nightmare. But this tactic did not jibe with voters’ positive discernment of Mendenhall and her leadership qualities. Campaign experts are increasingly concluding that dumping loads of money into advertising has diminishing returns. An understanding of the audience combined with a clever strategy is the most efficient approach.
Political operatives should be grateful for the guidance the “Thanksgiving election of 2023” is providing.
Webb: A big 2023 lesson was this: Never take anything for granted in politics, because long shots can win. Celeste Maloy came out of nowhere to defeat political heavyweights Greg Hughes, Becky Edwards and Bruce Hough, among others. Hughes, Edwards and Hough had decades of experience and high visibility in Utah politics. They seemed born to run for Congress. But Maloy leveraged her rural advantage, ran a grassroots campaign and won rather handily.
On the other hand, the Salt Lake City mayoral race went about as expected. Voters re-elected the safe, sensible, mainstream incumbent, Mayor Erin Mendenhall, rather than the hard-charging disruptor, former Mayor Rocky Anderson.
Recent political developments have come fast and furiously, and will only accelerate in the new year. Prospective candidates must spend the holidays making final decisions about running, because the 2024 candidate filing period is Jan. 2 to Jan. 8. Those in play include Rep. John Curtis, who earlier declined to join the U.S. Senate race. But then supporters and PACs have inundated local airwaves asking voters to urge Curtis to run, and he is reconsidering. Meanwhile, the presidential race will heat up with the Iowa caucuses coming on Jan. 15. And Robert F. Kennedy Jr., enjoying a surge in the polls as an independent, was scheduled to visit Utah this week. What sense can be made of this frenetic activity?
Pignanelli: The popular Curtis deflated supporters with an Oct. 2 guest editorial in this paper announcing his decision to not seek the Senate seat. Some followers then scrambled to other candidates who were courting them. But the congressman enjoys deep respect among national organizations who financed an aggressive draft movement — a rarity in Utah. (There was a similar, smaller push for Mitt Romney in 2018.) Yet, Curtis does not have the luxury of time to announce a change in his plans.
Kennedy’s antiestablishment, anti-vaccine fervor is gaining traction among some locals frustrated with the current slate of leading presidential contenders. The earlier deadlines are pushing more political activity into our once peaceful holiday season.
Webb: 2024 is going to be a wild and crazy election year, with races ranging from presidential, U.S. Senate and four congressional seats, to governor, county leaders and legislative seats. With candidate filings beginning Jan. 2, we will know very quickly who the candidates are. Then they will have a long slog until the general election, Nov. 5, with plenty of milestones and obstacles in their way, including party caucuses, county and state conventions, primary elections and the general election.
Utahns will be closely watching the presidential race and the battles for control of the U.S. Senate and House.
And Maloy, having barely settled into her congressional office, must jump right back in the campaign game in 2024 to win a full two-year term.
Utah’s precinct caucuses will be held March 5. What can readers expect leading up to this traditional Utah political activity?
Pignanelli: State officials enduring filed opponents during a legislative session stimulates a new era of political strategizing and campaigning. This will affect policy deliberations and communications to constituents.
Webb: Republicans will hold their presidential preference vote during the March 5 caucuses. So Republicans who want to help nominate a presidential candidate should watch to see if the party makes good on its promise to broaden caucus participation and make it easy to vote, including for people who can’t get to their neighborhood caucus meeting. Donald Trump will be heavily advantaged if the vast majority of caucus participants are arch-conservative activists who don’t reflect the broader GOP electorate.

https://www.deseret.com/2023/9/15/23875089/megyn-kelly-donald-trump-interview/,6 things President Trump told Megyn Kelly,Deseret News,2023-09-15T20:30:00Z,"Megyn Kelly interviewed former President Donald Trump for the first time since 2016 on Thursday. The interview was recorded at Trump’s home in Bedminster, New Jersey, and aired on the “Megyn Kelly Show” on Sirius XM.
Here are six takeaways from the interview, where they spoke about several controversial culture war issues.
1. Supporting Fauci and giving him a Presidential commendation
Kelly said to Trump, “For years you’ve been saying the reason you didn’t fire Anthony Fauci was because he’d been there for a long time, you would’ve taken heat, that it would have created ‘a fire storm,’” but, “not only did you not fire Fauci ... you made him a star.”
She continued, “You made him the face of the White House coronavirus. Having said that, he was out at every presser, that he was running hard for the administration, and that you actually gave him a Presidential commendation before you left office.”
Kelly asked, “Wouldn’t you like a do-over on that?”
Trump responded, “I don’t know who gave him the commendation.”
He continued, “Fauci was very important in the Biden administration … He didn’t want to stop China. He wanted to let everyone come in from China. I stopped it. I overrode it. I overrode many of the things he did. He was much less important to me.”
2. Mask mandates and vaccines during the Trump administration
Kelly asked Trump about mask mandates and vaccines during COVID-19 and said, “Wouldn’t you like a do-over on any of that?”
“Look, when this came in, nobody knew what the hell it was. It sounded like an ancient, you know, pandemic you thought was from 200 years ago or from 1917. We never thought you’d have a pandemic. We had no idea,” he said.
“We got word that bad things were happening in China right around the Wuhan clinic. And I was the one that said it was in the Wuhan clinic.”
3. Transgender issues
Kelly said in 2016, Trump allowed Caitlyn Jenner to use the women’s bathroom at Trump Tower and allowed biological men to compete in the Miss Universe competition he owned.
She asked, “How do you feel about it now? Should biological men who say they are trans be allowed in women’s locker rooms, women’s restrooms, women’s prisons, in women’s spaces?”
“I’m the one that wouldn’t allow it in the military. That was a big move. I went to the real generals and said, ‘What do you think?’ And they did not like it,” he said.
“My stance in that is really pretty much what I had in the military … I don’t think I’ve changed. At the beginning it was such a small subject, nobody really thought about it but then with time you change.”
Kelly followed up and asked, “Can a man become a woman?”
After some hesitation, Trump finally responded, “I think part of it is birth. Can a man give birth? No.”
4. Minors and gender transitions
Kelly asked, “Should children be provided access with puberty blockers and cross sex hormones when they’re minors?”
“I’m so against it,” Trump responded. “First of all, many of them ... when they’re older say, ‘Who did this to me?’ ‘Why did you do this to me?’ Second of all, the parents have to make the decision. You know, they’re trying to give it to school boards and schools, it’s unbelievable.”
5. The obstruction case and criminal charges
Kelly said, “Some argue that criminal or not, you behaved irresponsibly with our national security documents. We’ve all heard the audio of you, post presidency, showing third-parties some sort of document that you’re describing as secret. Allegedly it was a Department of Defense Mark Milley plan to attack Iran … you later told Brett Baier in an interview that you had no document that day, only newspapers and magazines. But we hear you on the tape saying, quote, ‘Look, this is him. This is the Defense Department and him. It’s highly confidential. This is secret. This was done by the military and given to me, as president I could have declassified it and now I can’t. This is still a secret.’ Why would you describe a newspaper as secret?”
“I did nothing wrong because I come under the presidential record,” he said. “This was done in 1978 and this was done for exactly this reason. I’m allowed to have these documents. The other side didn’t even mention that. They don’t even mention the words, ‘Presidential Records Act.’”
“Frankly, when I have them, they become unclassified. People think you have to go through a ritual. You don’t. At least in my opinion, you don’t.”
6. Does Trump think President Biden is too old?
Kelly asked, “Do you think that Joe Biden at 80 is too old?”
Trump, who is 77, responded, “No, not old, he’s incompetent. Age is interesting, because some people are very sharp and some people do lose it, but you lose it at 40 and 50 also. But, no, he’s not too old at all, he’s grossly incompetent.”",2023-09-15T20:30:00Z,2023,3,13
https://www.deseret.com/2023/4/20/23691147/unicef-reports-child-survival-crisis-africa-missed-vaccines-2019-2021/,UNICEF reports ‘child survival crisis’ in Africa due to missed vaccines during COVID-19,Deseret News,2023-04-20T19:24:32Z,"Africa is experiencing a “child survival crisis” after 12.7 million children missed taking one or more vaccinations from 2019-2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, a report by the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund said on Wednesday.
The Associated Press said UNICEF called this crisis “the worst regression of childhood vaccination in 30 years.”
The UNICEF press release about the report said the lack of vaccinated children makes the continent more susceptible to disease outbreaks, an effect they’re already experiencing after 700 children died from measles last year in Zimbabwe and more than 1,000 people died from a cholera outbreak earlier this year in Malawi.
The report said Africa has the most unvaccinated or under-vaccinated children in the world, with 8.7 million of them called “zero-dose” children after never having received any vaccinations between 2019-2021.
Two out of five zero-dose children in Africa live in Ethiopia or Nigeria, making them the countries with the highest number of zero-dose children, according to UNICEF.
Reversing the crisis
The World Health Organization predicts Africa needs about 33 million children vaccinated by 2025 in order to recover from the setback and get back on track, according to The Associated Press.
ABC News said, “UNICEF noted that children born just before or during the pandemic were now moving past the age when they would normally be vaccinated and stressed the need for health authorities to ‘catch up’ with those missed vaccinations to prevent more deadly disease outbreaks.”
UNICEF Regional Director for West and Central Africa Marie-Pierre Poirier said in the report, “We must act urgently to make sure that every child who has been left out is vaccinated. Using routine immunization as an entry point to strengthen primary health care and community systems will also help deliver other essential services, so that together with governments and partners, we can address multiple child deprivations and accelerate progress for children.”
“The recent resurgence of measles, cholera and poliovirus in Africa is a warning that we need to step up our efforts. African leaders must act now and take strong political action to reduce the gap in vaccination and make sure that all children are immunized and protected,” Mohamed M. Fall, UNICEF regional director for Eastern and Southern Africa, said in the report.
Global effect
The report said globally, vaccination coverage levels dropped in 112 countries, with a total of 67 million children missing one or more vaccines between 2019-2021.
The UNICEF said different contributors to the missed vaccinations worldwide included:
- Climate change.
- Health worker shortages.
- Vaccine hesitancy.
The report said solutions for the crisis include using effective immunization programs and catch-up campaigns to vaccinate children, building resilient health systems and investing in immunizations and health.",2023-04-20T19:24:32Z,2023,2,13
https://www.deseret.com/2023/3/5/23617095/donald-trump-don-peay-sportsmen-for-fish-and-wildlife-2024-campaign/,Why Donald Trump lost the support of the man who led his 2016 campaign in Utah,Deseret News,2023-03-06T04:00:00Z,"In 2019, Don Peay was one of Donald Trump’s most enthusiastic supporters. The Bountiful father of four best known for his hunting and wildlife advocacy managed Trump’s 2016 campaign in Utah and was happy with Trump’s achievements throughout his presidency.
“Sometimes he’s inartful, but bold leaders are at times,” he told me back then, adding, “He works harder and plays less than any president in the last 50 years.”
Last fall, when Trump was flirting with a 2024 run, I reached out to Peay, founder of Sportsmen for Fish and Wildlife, to see where he stood on Trump after everything that’s happened since Jan. 6, 2021. He said he was no longer in Trump’s camp, but didn’t want to talk about it.
That’s no longer the case.
Trump, Peay now says, cannot win in 2024 and his scorched-earth candidacy makes it more likely that a Democrat will sit in the Oval Office for another four years — maybe even eight, if a younger candidate replaces Joe Biden on the ticket.
Peay says it pains him to say this publicly; he is friendly with Trump’s sons, with whom he has hunted, and knows well how Trump can turn on people he considers disloyal. “I value loyalty above everything else — more than brains, more than drive and more than energy,” the former president once wrote.
There’s also the fact that Peay, a lifelong member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who served a mission in Australia, genuinely appreciates what Trump did as president, from having the Tabernacle Choir perform at his inauguration to delivering on his promise to appoint conservative Supreme Court justices. Despite his moral failings of years past, Trump is more aligned with religious values than people give him credit for, Peay says, and it bothers him that some Christians have shown an unwillingness to forgive Trump’s transgressions, as their faith demands.
“Sometimes we are too judgmental, and fail to live what we are taught — forgive and forget and move forward. America and the world could use more of that,” Peay said.
In a free-wheeling interview in which he touched on everything from his friendship with the late Sen. Orrin Hatch to what he sees as similarities between Trump and Mitt Romney, Peay spoke about how Trump lost his support, the wild-card candidates he’d like to see on the national stage, and the only thing that he believes could turn Trump’s political fortunes around.
Hunting for votes
One of the conceits of the film “Forrest Gump” was how the titular character kept showing up at important events in history. Peay, 62, has the same sort of vibe when it comes to presidential politics in Utah.
He was 32 when he organized President George H.W. Bush’s visit to Red Butte Gardens in 1992. Later, he helped raise funds for the candidacy of George W. Bush, and he once spent a couple of hours at the home of Vice President Dick Cheney. He’s been hunting with Romney and superstar athlete Bo Jackson. He has photos at the ready to prove his friendships, or at least association with, a constellation of A-list politicians and athletes, to include Jim McMahon, Ty Detmer and Donnie Edwards.
But of those A-listers who once lived in the White House, Peay was most enthusiastic about Trump, whom he first met in January 2016. He was introduced to Trump by his friend Jason Hairston, the late NFL star and hunter, who, according to Peay, said, “Mr. Trump, if you listen to Don Peay, he can help you get the hunter vote.”
Although it’s only been 7 1⁄2 years since Trump announced his candidacy on a now-famous escalator ride that his aides thought was a bad idea, what’s happened since sometimes obscures just how quixotic the 2016 campaign was at the start. Peay, who says he has “never been paid a nickel by any campaign, ever,” said there was never an official “Utah for Trump” campaign.
“They figured they didn’t need it. They didn’t pay a staff. They didn’t spend money here, but they had guys like me and General (Robert C.) Oaks and Sen. Orrin Hatch and Kathleen Anderson (working for Trump).
“I volunteered to head up this ragtag ‘Utahns for Trump’ in 2016; I also helped Don Jr. nationwide, mostly plugged him into people. Don Jr. is the reason his father became president. Don Jr. delivered that last two yards in Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.”
That’s because, Peay says, their parents were adamant that Donald Trump Jr. and his brother, Eric, didn’t grow up only knowing the blue-tinted bubble of New York City. They learned how to hunt, shoot and fish when they visited their maternal grandfather in (what was then) Czechoslovakia each summer. Those childhood experiences later morphed into votes that put Trump in the White House, according to Peay.
“A lot of hunters who had never voted came out and voted because Don Jr. spoke their language. A lot of guys who grew up blue-collar, union Democrats said ‘the Democrat Party has left us, and Trump speaks our language and he’ll protect our jobs, and Don. Jr. likes to hunt,’” Peay said.
That association came about, in part, because of Peay’s influence and that of the advocacy organization he founded in 1993, Sportsmen for Fish and Wildlife.
By the time the 2020 campaign rolled around, Peay was still pro-Trump and helped organize the group Latter-day Saints for Trump. Given the chance to make “the case for Trump” in a Deseret article that year, he said, “Yeah, he’s a character. But he’s a patriot. He loves this country, and it struck a chord when he said ‘Let’s make America great again’ because America was becoming a doorstop for the rest of the world.” Peay also lauded Trump’s work ethic, his tax reform and his military support, among other policies.
“I was very supportive — and still am — of what the president accomplished,” he said this week.
Peay is careful to always say “President Trump,” not Trump, and is respectful when speaking of the former president. But, he said, “I would say it’s a 98% chance I would not — in any way, shape or form — support a primary effort in 2024 for him.”
An ‘amazing’ president
As president, Trump had four notable achievements, Peay said.
“No. 1, he has a conservative Supreme Court — very critical. No. 2, we had a great economy. No. 3, he pushed through, in a very rapid fashion, the COVID vaccine. I don’t think many other presidents could have pushed the bureaucracies that fast. And No. 4, (Vladimir) Putin would not be in Ukraine today if Trump was president. He was a very strong world leader. Power respects power.
“But I’ve come to the conclusion that he can’t be president, or win the presidency, because he’s living in the past. He will not look at himself and say, ‘I probably cost myself 10 points in the last election.’”
Peay said he’s spoken to urban women who voted in swing states who “just got tired of his boorish, nonstop bashing that wasn’t necessary and wasn’t presidential. Some of them said, ‘We’ll pay $6 a gallon for gas, but we’re not going to put up with someone bashing people every day.’”
That played out noticeably in Arizona, which Trump lost by slightly more than 10,000 votes.
“Every time he went to Arizona, he stomped on John McCain’s grave and that probably cost him 50,000 votes in Arizona. He just couldn’t help himself from stomping on people; he picked a fight with the Bush family every chance he got — probably not smart politics.”
At the same time, Trump was beloved in some circles, especially among veterans, Peay said.
“I want to be very clear: He was an amazing president. But one of the real tragedies is that people in Ukraine are suffering because we have a weak president. ... It’s a tragedy that petty, personal politics got in the way of a great president.”
The missing 2%
Since Peay says there’s a 98% chance that he wouldn’t support Trump in a primary, what would have to happen in that space of 2% to change his mind?
Is it possible that Trump has learned from his mistakes and become a nicer person, a better leader, over the past two years?
Peay says he wouldn’t know. “I’ve tuned him out. A lot of people have.”
And, he says, “These things are complicated. There’s not a simple answer.”
But, “if he were to come out to the American people and say, ‘Fellow citizens, I looked in the mirror. I made some serious mistakes. I apologize. I won’t do them again, and for the next two years, I’m going to prove to you I won’t do them again, and I’m going to surround myself with great cabinet members and I’m going to listen to them,’” then he would have a chance.
“At some point, you have to say, ‘You know what, I lost.’
“I know he was friends with Tom Brady, but Tom Brady once, after he was losing some games, sat down and looked at himself first and then said to his team, ‘I’ve made mistakes, let’s get better.’ But President Trump, for some reason, he could not do that, and then his doubling and tripling and quadrupling down on Jan. 6 showed a tremendous lack of responsible decision making.”
Even with a sincere change of heart and manner, Peay said it would be tough for Trump to recover, especially given the way that the man who valued loyalty first and foremost was unwilling to show loyalty to members of his team. “Mike Pence was as loyal a soldier in that administration as anyone, but if Mike Pence can get thrown under the bus, I guess anyone and everyone could and would,” Peay said.
As for other candidates, announced and expected, for the GOP in 2024, Peay says the big four are Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott.
He also mentioned South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, who he believes should get consideration as a running mate. He called Cox a capable leader and “a conservative who’s smart and is moderate on cultural issues that reflect the electorate.”
As for Romney, he says Trump and Utah’s junior senator have a lot of things in common, including great wives and families, impressive accomplishments, and love of country. But he says it helps no one if “Team Romney or Team Trump decide to sit and shoot at each other, there cannot be a conservative who wins the presidency. There has to be a united effort. It’s so hard for conservatives to win elections nationwide. ...
“I think everybody knows there’s a time and a season when the great ones step aside and the smart ones cultivate the next leaders. ... For the country’s sake, it would be really great to have a young, dynamic leader who can lead for eight years.”
Would that be DeSantis? Or Zinke, whom he considers a friend?
Peay, who spends much of his time these days working to support veterans, isn’t saying. A lot can happen in eight months, he says; a lot more in two years. What he is saying, however, is that a President Donald Trump would start 2025 as a lame duck. And that although he knows speaking out will likely cause friction between him and the Trump family, he says he cares more about the vitality of the country he loves and the direction it is headed. He won’t lose sleep over any fallout. He was headed out to hunt coyotes in southern Utah over the weekend, is working on a book of life lessons gleaned from his experiences, and treasures most his wife, adult children and rapidly accumulating assembly of grandkids.
Has anyone with the campaign reached out since Trump announced he was running again? No, Peay said. He later mentions that his late father drilled into him, “Do what is right, let the consequences follow.”
Or, in the language of his faith, “Choose the right.”",2023-03-06T04:00:00Z,2023,1,13

The U.S. is extremely dependent on honeybees to pollinate food sources, and in the winter of 2018 to 2019, more than one-third of commercial bee colonies in the U.S. were wiped out due to “pesticide exposure, diseases from parasites and habitat loss,” The Guardian reported.
“One-third of the global food supply relies on pollination, and healthy commercial hives are essential to secure high crop yields,” Biotech firm Dalan, which created the vaccine, wrote in a statement.
One of the biggest threats to U.S. honeybees is a disease is called American foulbrood, and if bees are found to have the disease, there is no cure. The bees must be killed.
“Our vaccine is a breakthrough in protecting honeybees,” Annette Kleiser, chief executive of Dalan Animal Health, told The Guardian. “We are ready to change how we care for insects, impacting food production on a global scale.”
The vaccine will first be made available to commercial U.S. beekeepers, per Euronews.
How does a honeybee get vaccinated against disease?
The vaccine contains the bacteria Paenibacillus larvae and is mixed into the queen bee’s feed, which other bees bring to the queen for her to ingest.
“She ingests it, and fragments of the vaccine are deposited in her ovaries. Having been exposed to the vaccine, the developing larvae have immunity as they hatch,” Dalan wrote in a press release.",2023-01-05T14:13:00Z,2023,1,13

Dog and cat importation policies haven’t been updated for more than 70 years, the notice said, adding that, “Dog importation has changed drastically since that time and updates are needed to protect the public’s health.”
The notice said adjusted policies would “better protect the public’s health by preventing the reintroduction of dog rabies in the United States,” affect a small percentage of people and “provide flexibility to dog owners” to meet new requirements.
CNN quoted CDC spokesperson David Daigle: “These updates would establish an importation system designed to reduce fraud and improve the U.S. government’s ability to verify that imported dogs have met U.S. entry requirements.”
The proposed policies
According to CNN, the updated policies could include the following adjustments:
- Dogs from low-risk or rabies-free countries would be allowed entry into the U.S. with written documentation stating the dog lived in low-risk settings for the previous six months.
- Owners returning with their dogs from countries with high rabies incidence would be required to bring their dog to an airport that provides a CDC quarantine station.
- Returning owners would also complete a rabies vaccination form and have it signed by a veterinarian approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Public comment and feedback is open via the Federal Rulemaking Portal or through mail until Sept. 8. Comments via email will not be accepted by the CDC.
Rabies
According to the World Health Organization, rabies is a viral disease that attacks the central nervous system and can be prevented by vaccination.
Symptoms of rabies include fever, headache, vomiting, hyperactivity, difficulty swallowing, excessive salivation and “fear brought on by attempts to drink fluids because of difficulty swallowing water,” Mayo Clinic said.
“Once clinical symptoms appear, rabies is virtually 100% fatal. In up to 99% of cases, domestic dogs are responsible for rabies virus transmission to humans,” the World Health Organization added.
Although the U.S. was declared free of dog rabies in 2007, the disease continues to kill about 59,000 people globally each year, the majority of the victims children infected from dog bites, the notice said.",2023-07-12T17:45:44Z,2023,3,13

A sponge? An egg sac, perhaps? Or the beginning of an “X-Files” episode?
These ideas all arose in recorded commentary from scientists aboard the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association ship Okeanos Explorer last week as they observed a mysterious “golden orb” attached to a rock outcropping via remote camera some 2 miles below the surface in waters off the coast of Alaska.
NOAA scientist Sam Candio, coordinator for the ongoing Seascape Alaska 5: Gulf of Alaska Remotely Operated Vehicle Exploration and Mapping expedition, said the creature, or remnants of a creature, had been retrieved using a robotic arm and vacuum-powered sample tube and was headed to a lab for further testing.
“Isn’t the deep sea so delightfully strange?” Candio said in a press statement. “While we were able to collect the ‘golden orb’ and bring it onto the ship, we still are not able to identify it beyond the fact that it is biological in origin.
“We likely won’t learn more until we are able to get it into a laboratory setting where we can continue to pull from the collective expertise of the scientific community with more sophisticated tools than we are able to maintain on the ship. While somewhat humbling to be stumped by this finding, it serves as a reminder of how little we know about our own planet and how much is left to learn and appreciate about our ocean.”
NOAA reports the gold, dome-shaped specimen, a little over four inches in diameter, was found adhered to a rock amid a smattering of white sponges at a site 250 miles off the coast of southern Alaska at a depth of 2 miles. A small hole or tear near its base revealed a similarly colored interior, indicating, perhaps, that something had left or entered the fleshy dome.
“I just hope when we poke it, something doesn’t decide to come out,” one scientist can be heard saying on a video recording of the retrieval of the specimen, per the Miami Herald. “It’s like the beginning of a horror movie.”
The discovery was made just a week into NOAA’s Seascape Alaska 5 expedition that launched Aug. 23 and continues through Sept. 16. The primary goal of the research effort is to “map, explore and characterize ecologically and economically important deepwater habitats in unexplored regions off Alaska,” according to NOAA. Operations are focused on exploring deep waters greater than 656 feet for mapping operations and 820 feet for remote operated vehicle operations in U.S. waters, the high seas and Canadian waters off Alaska.
While the intriguing gold orb specimen was found at a depth of about 2 miles, some of the remote dives will descend to nearly 4 miles beneath the surface of the Gulf of Alaska to explore deep-sea coral and sponge habitats, fish habitats, chemosynthetic communities and the water column and to improve knowledge of past and potential geohazards, per NOAA’s mission statement.
NOAA reports that while it’s still unclear if the golden dome is associated with a known species, a new species, or perhaps represents an unknown life stage of an existing one, the discovery highlights the importance of ocean exploration.
“New species have the potential to reveal new sources for medical therapies and vaccines, food, energy, and other societal benefits and knowledge,” Candio said. “Collectively, the data and information gathered during this expedition will help us close gaps in our understanding of this part of the planet, so we can better manage and protect it.”",2023-09-08T20:07:11Z,2023,3,13
https://www.deseret.com/utah/2023/1/17/23537784/immigrant-journey-deportation-citizenship-mexico/,An immigrant’s journey from deportation to citizenship,Deseret News,2023-01-18T02:01:55Z,"Jesús Contreras slowly drove a mud-splattered feeding machine through a dimly lit shed, dispensing a glob of food atop each wire cage in the mink shed on a recent January day.
A mixture of snow and muck covered the saturated ground between the rows of wood-framed buildings that house the 2,600 animals at B6 Farms in Lehi. Sleet fell as Contreras, wearing jeans, work boots and a hoodie pulled over his head that hid most of his hair but not his salt-and-pepper mustache, made his way to a barn to repair some pressboard boxes the mink had chewed through.
Besides feeding the animals, he cleans their pens, administers vaccines and tackles whatever else needs to be done around the farm. He arrives each morning at 7:18 a.m., has a cup of coffee in the work shed and punches in at 8 a.m. As the ranch has shrunk in size over the years, Contreras, who turns 63 this month, remains its only full-time employee.
“He knows what to do before I do,” says Brent Beckstead, whose family started the business about 45 years ago.
Contreras has worked at the ranch from almost the day he arrived in Utah from Mexico on a snowy April 1, 1980. It was the first time he had seen snow. He shakes his head at how much has fallen this winter.
But for 40 years, rain or shine, Contreras has faithfully tended to his duties — except for the 40 months he spent back in Mexico after being wrongfully deported.
Poor legal advice and fierce resistance from the immigration bureaucracy to correct some mistakes cast him into a prolonged legal battle to regain what he had lost.
Now, more than a decade after becoming a symbol of the need for immigration reform in a precedent-setting court case, Contreras will take the U.S. citizenship oath on Thursday.
“I am so excited. I am happy to be in the United States. Now I have the opportunity to be with my kids and now I can see my grandkids grow up,” said the father of five and grandfather of six.
Contreras’ legal case was part of a national movement aimed at getting courts to hear the appeals of immigrants who had been deported.
The U.S. government took the position that if an immigrant was no longer in the country, then the courts didn’t have to hear their arguments. But it created an incentive for the government to quickly deport people so their cases couldn’t be heard on appeal.
During his more than three-year banishment, attorneys Chris Keen and Ed Carter pursued legal remedies that eventually established an important precedent for immigrants to be heard in court even after being deported. Keen called the Contreras case “exceptional.”
“It made it so that everybody after him, even if they were deported, they still get their day in court. A deportation can’t cause a dismissal of their case as (the government) tried to say in this case here,” Keen said.
Contreras experienced the “byzantine” bureaucracy of the U.S. immigration system at its worst, and yet he persevered, Keen said. He said the case represents positive contributions made by immigrants to the United States and the importance of immigration advocacy.
Coming to America
Contreras first came to the United States in 1974. He rode a bus from his hometown near San Luis Potosí in central Mexico to Laredo, Texas. He and six other guys walked the 160 miles from Laredo to San Antonio to find work. He did seasonal jobs in fields and orchards. He was 14.
In 1980, friends told him to come to Utah for work. He has been at the mink farm ever since. The Beckstead family can’t recall a day that Contreras did not show up for work. In a letter to the court after he was deported, the Becksteads extolled his loyalty and dedication. They consider him not just an employee but part of their family.
“I’ll put him up against any 20-year-old, with shoveling manure, working, whatever it is. He never complains. He’ll do whatever I ask him,” Beckstead said recently.
Seven years after taking the job, the government granted Contreras temporary permanent resident status under a special agricultural worker program. Two years later, he became a lawful permanent resident or green card holder.
Contreras was living in Midvale with a roommate in 1991 when Salt Lake metro narcotics agents knocked on the door. He was in the shower. He said his roommate went out the window. Detectives found five grams of cocaine in the house.
Contreras was charged with felony possession of a controlled substance. He pleaded guilty to a reduced class A misdemeanor for attempted possession of cocaine. A judge ordered him to 12 months in jail but suspended the sentence. (The record was expunged in 2006.)
The drugs weren’t his, Contreras said, but “I’m the one who paid for it.” He said his roommate was never charged and ultimately died of an overdose. Contreras said his attorney at the time never told him he might get deported if he pleaded guilty.
And he didn’t — at least not right away.
Flagged in L.A.
For the next 13 years, Contreras traveled to Mexico every year to spend a week or so with his parents without a problem. But on a return flight to Salt Lake City through Los Angeles in January 2004, the Department of Homeland Security flagged his long-forgotten drug conviction. The government placed him in removal proceedings on the grounds that he was inadmissible to the United States.
From there, the legal wheels turned slowly.
In 2006, he paid an attorney $1,500 to represent him in Immigration Court. His lawyer filed a cancellation of removal petition and had Contreras’ criminal record expunged. But he didn’t properly serve the cancellation of removal paperwork on the government’s attorney.
A judge could never have granted the cancellation because it required Contreras to be a resident of the U.S. for seven years. The clock stopped on his residency after his 1991 conviction, giving him less than two years since he had obtained his green card.
In November 2007, the judge denied the application based on that reason and ordered Contreras deported. His attorney filed a notice of appeal within the 30-day requirement but failed to file a brief to support it. It took nearly two years for the Board of Immigration Appeals to dismiss the appeal without a written or oral argument from Contreras’ lawyer on March 30, 2009.
A few days later, immigration agents were at the mink ranch. They showed Contreras a photo of a man they were looking for. It was Contreras himself. He was confined to the Utah County Jail in Spanish Fork. On April 9, 2009, he was on his way back to Mexico.
The day before he left, one of Contreras’ daughters contacted Keen. The attorney visited Contreras in jail and reviewed the case. He quickly discovered that Contreras’ lawyer had “imprudently” filed the wrong application, according to a court affidavit.
Keen said the lawyer should have sought a waiver from deportation under a different section of the law before the Immigration Court, which judges routinely granted and for which he was eligible.
“You win those all day long. They were given out like candy,” he said.
Back in Mexico
The deportation flight from Salt Lake City flew to El Paso, Texas. Contreras said he didn’t eat for 36 hours. He walked across the border to Ciudad Juárez under the watchful eye of border agents. He then rode a bus for hours to his hometown near San Luis Potosí. He thought he had zero chance of returning to Utah.
“I was thinking I’m not coming back. I’m going to stay here forever,” he said.
Contreras worked in the fields and raised cows in La Palma Salinas, a tiny town of 1,500 people. He worried about his children and grandchildren in Utah. He talked to them on the telephone, but calls were expensive. One of the two phones in town was at a small grocery store. Someone at the store would go find him when he had a call from his family or Keen.
One good thing that came from his time in Mexico was being there when his father died. His mother died a year later after he had returned to Utah.
Keen, meantime, filed a motion with the Board of Immigration Appeals to reopen Contreras’ case. The board rejected the motion, citing lack of jurisdiction because Contreras was no longer in the country.
Rule and law in conflict
Dating back to 1952, immigration regulations have included a “departure bar” — an administrative rule that attempts to bar a person from pursuing a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider after he or she has departed the United States, according to a paper by immigration attorneys Beth Werlin and Trina Realmuto, who supported Keen and Carter in Contreras’ case.
Relying on that rule, the Board of Immigration Appeals and the Immigration Courts refused to hear motions filed by individuals who had been deported from the United States.
Even after Congress codified the right to file one motion to reopen an immigration case as an amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Board of Immigration Appeals continued to contend it lacked jurisdiction to consider motions filed by people who had already left the country.
That put the administrative rule and the law passed by Congress at odds.
Resolving the contradiction
As cases on the departure bar made their way through the judicial system, appeals courts around the country were initially split on the issue. Keen said it was unclear which way the decisions were going to fall. As he and Carter litigated Contreras’ case, appeals courts began to invalidate the departure bar.
Still, a three-judge panel at the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver sided with the government in Contreras’ case — as the court had previously done in another immigrant’s case.
But Keen and Carter sought and were granted an en banc hearing before all 11 active judges in the 10th Circuit, including now U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch.
In his argument, Carter emphasized the “fundamental” unfairness of Contreras not being allowed a hearing on the reasons why he was eligible to stay in the U.S. on a deportation waiver. He also contended the immigration court attempted to assert its own jurisdiction despite a lack of congressional authority.
The court overturned the decision in January 2012, finding the law “plainly guarantees each noncitizen the right to file a motion to reopen, regardless of whether they have departed the United States. Because the post-departure bar regulation contravenes this right, it is not a valid exercise of the attorney general’s rulemaking authority.”
The ruling gave Contreras his day in court.
“He was just never listened to, until after the (10th Circuit) decision,” Carter said.
Keen called the case groundbreaking. “It fixed a wrong,” he said.
“How many other people before him were deported where they had good, strong claims but their appeals were dismissed because they were out of the country?” Keen said. “I’ve had a few, and (there are) probably thousands and thousands who might have won if this rule was interpreted appropriately.”
Returning home
Six months after the 10th Circuit ruling, the immigration appeals board granted the deportation waiver. Keen said Contreras’ former lawyer should have filed it in the first place. That allowed Contreras to return to the country, which Keen said is “extremely rare.”
As part of the appeal, Keen had to file a complaint with the Utah State Bar against Contreras’ former lawyer, alleging he provided ineffective counsel. Though it was uncomfortable to call out a fellow attorney, Keen said the board would have ignored Contreras’ case without it.
“It’s to dissuade people from getting their day in court,” he said.
Keen said he’ll never forget the day he called Contreras in Mexico.
“I could hear chickens in the background as I waited for him to get on the phone,” he said. “He was unusually calm as I tearfully shared the good news.”
Keen said he wasn’t sure Contreras believed him or if the news sunk in.
Contreras simply says he was “excited” to be able to return, especially to be reunited with his children and grandchildren.
Beckstead, who contributed about $5,000 toward Contreras’ legal fees, immediately gave him his old job back at the mink ranch where he continues to work with no plans to retire. Contreras said he doesn’t feel good about not working and would die if he retired.
It took another five years before the Immigration Court in Salt Lake City granted Contreras the waiver Keen said his previous attorney should have filed to begin with. He also had his green card restored in 2017.
Now, he will become a U.S. citizen. He’ll obtain a U.S. passport. Contreras says he will be able to travel more freely and without fear of deportation. And if he does retire one day, he can stay in Mexico as long as he likes and come back whenever he wants.
Looking back, Contreras has a hard time summing up the last two decades.
“I don’t know how I can. It takes a long time, just be patient, I guess,” he said. “(It’s) hard to be patient. Lucky me, I’m back.”",2023-01-18T02:01:55Z,2023,1,13

This matter has political ramifications, so the Utah Legislature and the U.S. Congress are debating and may take action. We’re dinosaurs, having grown up in the pre-social media era. But we still have opinions.
Liberals say social media companies aren’t aggressive enough in eliminating disinformation from their platforms, including conspiracy theories regarding elections and COVID-19 vaccinations. Conservatives say social media companies have been biased against them, have shut down free speech and are damaging young people. Who is right? Has Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter improved things?
Pignanelli: “I think a lot of things that get blamed on social media are just human problems, and social media just makes them more visible.” — Elizabeth Nolan Brown, senior editor, Reason Magazine
When in junior high, I overheard a heated debate on talk radio (the “social media” of the 1970s) about whether the elitist Trilateral Commission was controlling society. Most historians agree the yellow journalistic tactics of William Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer in their newspapers fostered the Spanish-American War. The development of the printing press exponentially spread antisemitism throughout medieval Europe. So whatever medium humans use to collect and distribute news circulates both information and disinformation. (75% of Americans now use social media.)
The internet has done much to expand human knowledge, therefore government regulation of content is a dangerous path. Concerned activists suggest instead transparency of the algorithms used and a focus on consumer protection. The escapades surrounding Elon Musk serve as a valuable prompt to Americans to scrutinize both the organizations and individuals behind statements in social media.
My parents assured me the “Trilateral Commission conspiracy” was a silly rumor — proving that consulting with family and friends is the best check against falsehoods.
Webb: When I was a journalist I was fond of a quote by John Milton, the great English poet and intellectual. I found it inspirational. In 1667, Milton wrote in “Areopagitica”: “Let her (Truth) and Falsehood grapple; who ever knew Truth put to the worse in a free and open encounter?” Milton was right for about 336 years — until social media arrived about 15 years ago.
Today, Milton’s Truth (with a capital T) doesn’t have much of a chance against the falsehoods and pervasiveness of social media — the algorithms that deliver garbage at every click, untruths going viral with no ability to stop them, bots creating millions or billions of deceptive posts sparking outrage and unhealthy bodily comparisons, along with insecurity and depression. When immense success and wealth are produced by clicks, unsavory people and businesses will do anything to generate clicks.
Government interference and censorship are not the answer. Government interference will only give more power to the political party in charge and may stifle more wholesome competition. It would be great if Musk could clean up Twitter, but I’m not hopeful.
An enormous social media issue is the damage these platforms have done to the self-images and mental health of young people. Are reforms needed via legislation and family screen-time rules?
Pignanelli: A conclusion social media harms adolescents drives whether sponsoring companies will be required to limit access by age. To do so effectively will mandate companies to obtain deep personal data on everyone in order to decipher who is a minor. That begs the question of forcing social media companies into such a situation.
Because this is a technology dilemma, solutions teem in technology. A number of apps exist to help parents monitor content and accessibility. Requiring government or corporations to intrude on personal lives is not the answer.
Webb: Used properly and sparingly, social media and other tech platforms can be useful for purposes like communicating with family and real friends and supporting business objectives such as promoting good products.
I’ve spent plenty of time on YouTube learning how to connect a posthole digger to a 3-point hitch on a tractor, or how to build an ATV bridge across a creek. But it takes immense self-discipline to stick to the positive aspects of social media and not get distracted by — and addicted to — the garbage.
The good, unfortunately, is dwarfed by the worship of beautiful bodies, the nasty bickering, the outright political falsehoods and conspiracy theories. Social media addictions too often replace real relationships, people thinking they can find fulfillment following the lives and fashions of the Kardashians. The most popular “influencers” are those who dare show the most skin in TikTok and Instagram posts or promote the craziest conspiracies.
We’re not going to be able to regulate away the damage these platforms do to young people and others. The genie is out of the bottle and government can’t do much more than apply a few bandages. It comes down to families and individuals establishing standards, limiting screen time and filling time with real and more wholesome activities.
Should we allow such incredible communications and political power to be concentrated in the hands of a few social media companies and their owners?
Pignanelli: Constructing regulations just to keep companies from “being big” is destructive and pointless, as our economy is constantly changing the playing field. Indeed, just in the last year the power of Facebook and Twitter has diminished. As American families search for alternate means to garner information, the entities that supply such that will grow, tumble and evolve.
Webb: It’s a very difficult dilemma. The algorithms control the flow of information and those who create the algorithms wield immense power. But government censorship and interference would make things worse.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on Republican-pushed legislation to repeal Obama's health care law (all times local):
2:50 p.m.
President Donald Trump says Congress should have approved legislation to repeal the Obama-era health law after working on it for seven years. But he says ""you can't have everything.""
Trump referred to Washington as ""the swamp"" before pledging that ""we're going to get it done.""
Three Republican senators -- Arizona's John McCain, Alaska's Lisa Murkowski and Maine's Susan Collins -- voted to kill the GOP drive to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.
Trump says he said from the beginning to ""let Obamacare implode"" and then repeal it. He says ""I turned out to be right.""
Trump spoke Friday in Suffolk County, New York.

2:10 p.m.
A Republican congressman is lashing out at two Senate Republicans who helped defeat the Senate GOP health care bill.
Iowa's Steve King says in a statement that the Affordable Care Act is a ""law that ought not exist, and I will continue to advocate for its complete repeal.""
He singles out Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, saying she ""was initially appointed to her position by her father,"" and that her write-in campaign in 2010 ""was essentially a revolt against GOP primary voters.""
Murkowski won election to a fourth term last year.
Of Arizona Sen. John McCain, King says McCain recently told the Senate ""he would return and 'give all of you cause to regret the nice things you said about me.' He kept his word.""
The two senators along with Maine's Susan Collins joined Democrats in defeating the bill.
___
2:05 p.m.
A powerful House Republican says the tax increases in the Obama health law will not be addressed in the tax reform bill.
The Obamacare taxes hit mostly corporations and high-income families. Eliminating them would reduce tax revenues by nearly $1 trillion over the next decade.
Congressman Kevin Brady of Texas says addressing them in the tax bill would mean higher tax rates for families and local businesses.
Meanwhile, Brady said House Republicans will explore ways to fix some of Obamacare's problems. That contradicts administration officials who say they want to let it fail.
Brady doesn't offer specifics. He says, ""Right now, we're just assessing the situation.""
Brady chairs the powerful House Ways and Means Committee.

12:26 p.m.
Senator John McCain is calling on the Senate to ""start fresh"" on health care after he cast the decisive vote killing the GOP's ""Obamacare"" repeal effort.
McCain says that ""it is now time to return to regular order with input from all of our members — Republicans and Democrats.""
In a statement Friday, McCain calls on lawmakers of both parties ""to trust each other, stop the political gamesmanship, and put the health care needs of the American people first.""
McCain says that the Senate's essential qualities of trust and bipartisanship have been missing in recent years as senators have succumbed to ""partisan rancor and gridlock.""
And he concludes: ""We can do this.""

11:45 a.m.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer is praising the three Republicans who broke with their party to reject the GOP health care bill, especially John McCain.
Schumer told reporters at a news conference Friday, ""I have not seen a senator who speaks truth to power as strongly, as well and as frequently as John McCain.""
Schumer also praised Maine's Susan Collins and Alaska's Lisa Murkowski as tough women.
His comments came just hours after the three Republicans joined all 48 Senate Democrats in voting against the so-called ""skinny repeal"" bill, a loss that dealt a severe blow to President Donald Trump's agenda and GOP's years-long effort to repeal and replace Obamacare.
Schumer also said he spoke to Speaker Paul Ryan on Friday about working on bipartisan legislation.

A spokesman for former President Barack Obama says that the Affordable Care Act ""has always been about something bigger than politics.""
In a statement, Kevin Lewis says that Obama ""has always said we should build on this law, just as members of both parties worked together to improve Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.""
Lewis says tens of millions of people have benefited from improvements under the law including free preventive care such as mammograms and vaccines.
And it remains that way, Lewis says, ""because of everyone who mobilized, organized and made their voices heard.""

House Speaker Paul Ryan says he's ""disappointed and frustrated"" by the failure of health care legislation in the Senate.
But Ryan says ""we should not give up"" after promising for years to repeal and replace ""Obamacare.""
At the same time, the speaker says in a statement Friday that overhauling the tax code is at the top of the House's list of priorities.
Ryan is pledging to pursue ""historic tax reform"" in the fall.
He issued his statement as the House prepared to leave Washington for its annual August recess.
The House passed legislation repealing and replacing ""Obamacare"" in May. But after a failed vote early Friday in the Senate, it's not clear GOP leaders will be able to resuscitate the efforts.
___
10:10 a.m.
President Donald Trump says that if the Senate wants to pass legislation, it ""must immediately go to a 51 vote majority,"" but his math is off.
His morning tweet is puzzling, since the Republican majority failed to even reach 51 votes to overhaul the nation's health care laws. Instead, they got 49 votes.
Typically, legislation in the Senate requires 60 votes or more to avoid a filibuster. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has repeatedly rejected Trump's proposal to lower the threshold.
Trump has also complained that three Republican senators voted with Democrats to block the way. They are Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and, providing the decisive vote, Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
Trump advocated for a lower threshold, adding that ""so many great future bills & budgets"" ought to be able to pass with only 51 votes.
___
7:40 a.m.
Rep. Mo Brooks says the ""failure"" of the GOP health care overhaul is ultimately Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's responsibility.
The Alabama Republican said Friday on CNN that McConnell should press the Senate to pass a rewrite of President Barack Obama's signature law — or step aside.
Brooks said, ""If they're going to quit, well then, maybe by God they ought to start at the top with Mitch McConnell leaving his position.""
He added that ""The leadership at the top is responsible. The buck stops there.""
Brooks also questioned whether McConnell can accomplish Trump's other priorities, such as tax and infrastructure reform. The defeat early Thursday morning of the health care bill, Brooks said, is potentially ""a killer"" for the rest of the Trump agenda.
___
5:40 a.m.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has taken comfort in the defeat in the Senate of a Republican-pushed measure aimed at scaling back, or partially repealing, former President Back Obama's Affordable Care Act.
In a statement following defeat of the measure on a 49-51 vote, the California Democrat says, ""The American people have spoken loud and clear against the higher costs and monstrous cruelty of Trumpcare.""
She adds, ""Now, Congress must finally pivot to the long overdue bipartisan work to update and improve the Affordable Care Act and to continue to lower Americans' health costs."" Her counterpart in the Senate, Chuck Schumer of New York, said after the votes that Democrats who resisted the GOP legislation ""are not celebrating."" But he also said that he's ""relieved"" the measure didn't pass.
___
3:39 a.m.
Dealing a serious blow to President Donald Trump's agenda, the Senate early Friday rejected a measure to repeal parts of former President Barack Obama's health care law after a night of high suspense in the U.S. Capitol.
Unable to pass even a so-called ""skinny repeal,"" it was unclear if Senate Republicans could advance any health bill despite seven years of promises to repeal ""Obamacare.""
""This is clearly a disappointing moment,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. ""I regret that our efforts were not enough, this time.""
""It's time to move on,"" he said. The vote was 49-51 with three Republicans joining all Democrats in voting 'no.'
McConnell put the health bill on hold and announced that the Senate would move onto other legislation next week.
Trump responded on Twitter: ""3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!""

SANDY — Raquel Zapata didn't want to spend the money to get vision tests for all three of her kids, but she realized it was an important part of overall health.
Lucky for them, the Hispanic Health Fair offered free vision screenings, among other medical and health services at the South Towne Expo on Saturday, where one of the three kids ended up needing further attention.
""He might need glasses,"" Zapata, of West Jordan, said, adding that she would have put it off to avoid the financial hurdle some appointments create.
""I didn't want to pay, knowing that they could probably just say, 'everything is fine,'"" she said.
Zapata is one of thousands of Hispanics who attended the fair, which Telemundo Utah station manager Steve Downing said sometimes serves as ""their annual checkup.""
""The Hispanic community is a population that is under-served and also it is under-insured,"" Downing said. ""It's important that they get health information in their language and are able to take advantage of the free or low-cost screenings.""
This is the second year that Telemundo has sponsored the health fair and it has grown larger, to accommodate a bigger crowd, but also offers more services.
In addition to vision screenings, people could receive dental exams and teeth cleaning, blood pressure reading, glucose monitoring and cholesterol screening services, as well as flu shots from bilingual professionals at the fair. Information on health insurance and benefits available to the immigrant population in Utah was also a big and important part of the fair, Downing said.
""A lot of them come from a different health system,"" he said. ""So it is important to educate them and help them learn their options and how to navigate the system.""
Options for health care depend on residency status, said Alex Meza, an information specialist with Utah's 2-1-1, a free service of United Way. She said people must have a taxpayer identification number or Social Security Number to qualify.
Enrollment for a marketplace plan on healthcare.gov is open Nov. 1 to Dec. 15.
""But there are wellness programs and ways to care for yourselves without health care coverage,"" Meza said.
Information about various community health clinics or charity and low-cost programs, she said, can be found by visiting 211Utah.org or by calling 2-1-1. Information on health care benefits and the Affordable Care Act can be found at takecareutah.org.
The health fair happens to be one of the most popular events among the area's Hispanic population, which is up to about 17 percent of Utah's entire population, Downing said. Telemundo, he added, is the top Spanish-language television station in Utah, based on viewership and the station's community involvement, of which, the fair is included.
""The Hispanic community is a population that is under-served and also it is under-insured. It's important that they get health information in their language and are able to take advantage of the free or low-cost screenings.""
""I really like the opportunity it gives for us to get free access to visual, dental, vaccinations and information that is beneficial to our health,"" Zapata said. She has insurance for her family, but said it is important to her to save wherever she can.
""It's really a great event and very helpful,"" she said.
Telemundo works with various partners to offer the health fair, including Intermountain Healthcare and its insurance arm, Select Health, among others throughout the community. Walgreens was on hand to offer influenza vaccinations and the Junior League of Salt Lake City volunteered to offer dental health help.
The end goal, Downing said, is not only to help more of the Hispanic population to get enrolled and participate in routine health care, but also ""help them make better decisions to better their lives.""",2017-10-21T00:00:00Z,2017,4,14

No woman should die of cervical cancer because, with early detection, it is among the most preventable types of cancer. Dr. Alex Larson, an OB/GYN at Ogden Clinic, talks about what causes cervical cancer and how it can be prevented.
What is cervical cancer and what causes it?
The narrow opening from the uterus to the vagina, called the cervix, is covered with flat, thin cells called squamous cells. Most cervical cancers (about 90 percent) are caused by mutations in squamous cells. The best defense against cervical cancer is regular screening for abnormalities of the cervix, including the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV).
How is HPV related to cervical cancer?
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is found in over 90 percent of all cervical cancers. There are over 100 strains of HPV and most of them not cancer-causing (called low-risk HPV). However, a handful of HPV strains is considered high-risk because they can cause cell abnormalities or cancer. HPV-16 and HPV-18 are the “hard-hitters” of high-risk strains.
HPV is acquired through skin-to-skin contact, most often passed through sex. It’s extremely common for men and women to acquire some type of HPV in their lifetime. In fact, approximately 80 percent of women have been infected by some type of HPV by age 50, but the majority of them do not develop cervical cancer. Regular screenings for high-risk HPV and other preventative measures are our best defense against cervical cancer.
What is the screening schedule for HPV?
Regular screenings during your well-woman visits are the most important thing you can do to prevent cervical cancer. These are the current ASCCP guidelines for cervical cancer screenings:
Age 21 – 29: Pap tests begin routinely
A Pap test looks for any abnormal cells on the cervix that could lead to cancer if untreated. If the Pap test comes back normal, it’s good for three years. If abnormal cells are detected, they may be DNA-tested for the presence of high-risk HPV strains.
Beginning at age 30: Pap and HPV tests are performed routinely
The Pap test looks for cell changes caused by HPV while the HPV test looks for the virus itself, specifically types that are linked to cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is slow-growing, meaning that it tends to develop as a woman ages. The goal of testing for HPV at age 30 is to catch the progression of high-risk HPV cells. Pap and HPV co-testing continue every five years for most women.
Do HPV vaccines prevent cervical cancer?
We expect they will. Estimates are that we will see the effects of vaccination on cervical cancer rates about 20 years from when vaccination began (we’re nearly 10 years into that time). The better we are at widespread vaccination, the greater the expected decrease in cervical cancer rates. There are currently three HPV vaccines available that have been proven safe and well-tolerated. All vaccines protect against HPV-16 and HPV-18, dangerous strains which account for 70 percent of all cervical cancer cases. Two HPV vaccines, Gardasil® and Gardasil 9® also protect against low-risk strains including those that cause genital warts.
If I have received the HPV vaccine, do I still need routine Pap/HPV screening?
Yes, women who have received an HPV vaccine are currently treated the same as women who haven’t when it comes to Pap and HPV screening. The vaccine does not prevent against all HPV types that can lead to cervical cancer.
Is there anything else you would like to add about cervical cancer prevention?
Most often, I tell my patients to stay calm if they become infected with HPV. Most strains of HPV are low-risk, and even if a woman acquires a high-risk strain, her chances of developing cervical cancer are very low if she and her OB/GYN keep an eye on the virus’s course with regular visits and resolve any dysplasia, or abnormal cell activity, early before it has the chance to get worse.",2017-01-10T00:00:00Z,2017,1,14

WASHINGTON (AP) — Call them rebels with a cause. Or two. Or three. Or 10.
When throngs of women from around the nation converge on Washington for a march on the day after Donald Trump's inauguration, they will arrive driven by a multitude of motivations.
Gay rights, gun control, immigrant rights, equal pay, reproductive freedom, racial justice, worker rights, climate change, support for vaccinations: They all make the list of progressive causes that are attracting people to the Women's March on Washington and its sister marches across the country and the world this coming Saturday.
""We are not going to give the next president that much focus,"" says Linda Sarsour, a national march organizer and executive director of the Arab American Association of New York. ""What we want from him is to see us in focus.""
But while Trump's name may not literally appear in the march's ""mission and vision"" statement, the common denominator uniting the marchers appears to be a loathing for the president-elect and dismay that so much of the country voted for him.
""This march feels like a chance to be part of something that isn't pity, isn't powerlessness,"" says Leslie Rutkowski, an American living in Norway who plans to fly back for the march. ""I hope it is unifying. I hope it flies in the face of Trump's platform of hate and divisiveness.""
Adds Kelsey Wadman, a new mom in California who's helping to organize a parallel march in San Diego: ""It's not just about Donald Trump the person. It's about what he evoked out of the country.""
The march in Washington is set to start with a program near the Capitol and then move toward the White House. It probably will be the largest of a number of inauguration-related protests.
Christopher Geldart, the District of Columbia's homeland security director, said he expected the march to draw more than the 200,000 people organizers are planning for, based on bus registrations and train bookings.
The focus of the march has been a work in progress since the idea of a Washington mobilization first bubbled up from a number of women's social media posts in the hours after Trump's election.
The group's November application for a march permit summed up its purpose as to ""come together in solidarity to express to the new administration & Congress that women's rights are human rights and our power cannot be ignored.""
That phrasing rankled some who thought it was tied too closely to Hillary Clinton, the defeated Democratic nominee, whose famous Beijing speech as first lady declared that ""women's rights are human rights."" The fact that the initial march organizers were mostly white women also generated grumbling, this time from minorities. Gradually, the march's leadership and its mission statements have become more all-inclusive.
Recent releases from march organizers state the event ""intends to send a bold message to the incoming presidential administration on their first day in office, to leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate, and to the world, that we stand together in solidarity and expect elected leaders to act to protect the rights of women, their families and their communities.""
America Ferrera, leading the celebrity contingent for the march, rolled out a long list of concerns in a statement announcing her role.
""Immigrant rights, worker rights, reproductive rights, LGBTQIA rights, racial justice and environmental rights are not special interests, they affect us all and should be every American's concerns,"" she wrote.
Other prominent names involved with the march have put a spotlight on one concern — or another.
Actress Scarlett Johansson, who plans to participate, put her focus on the incoming administration's intentions of ""reducing the availability of women's health care and attacking her reproductive rights."" Actress Debra Messing, listed as a supporter of the march, wrote of the need to protect Planned Parenthood.
Expect thousands of the marchers to turn up wearing hand-knitted pink ""pussyhats"" — sending a message of female empowerment and pushing back against Trump's demeaning comments about women.
Scan #WhyIMarch posts on social media, and you'll find a wide-ranging list of reasons. A sampling: equal pay for women veterans, fighting chauvinism, empowering daughters, renouncing racism, higher pay for women who are college presidents.
Wadman, the California mom, tweeted a #WhyIMarch photo with her 4-month-old son and this note: ""Because when my son asks me about this era of American history I don't want to tell him that I did nothing.""
Rutkowski, the American living in Norway, emailed that she's ""not completely satisfied"" with the mixed messages attached to the march.
""I also don't like— from what I've seen in the news and on Facebook — the proclivity for infighting,"" she wrote. ""But I believe that a quarter of a million female bodies — hopefully more, hopefully men, as well — will make the incoming administration and new Congress aware that we are watching, we are listening and we will resist.""
Carmen Perez, one of the march's national organizers, sees beauty in the many messages attached to the march: ""Women don't live single-issue lives and we are thrilled to be joined by women who understand and reflect the intersecting issues for which we stand.""

LONG BEACH, CA. (CNN) — Standing 6 feet 5 inches tall, Patrick York is a gentle giant.
The soft-spoken 26-year-old with a ""Peace Love Tai Chi"" T-shirt flowed into a grounded stance on a Long Beach, California, hilltop. He was among several dozen people taking a free tai chi class this warm July day.
""I do tai chi to reconnect my mind, body and spirit, as well as to strengthen my muscles, loosen my joints, get my body relaxed,"" York said.
What is tai chi?
Tai chi is an ancient martial art developed in China that's often referred to as a ""moving meditation.""
""It takes the principles that we've observed in nature and uses it as a martial art,"" said Daniel Hoover, tai chi master, chiropractor and owner of School of Healing Martial Arts in Long Beach. Hoover gives a free class every Sunday on this hill.
Tai chi's slow, graceful movements are accompanied by deep circular breathing. Though tai chi is practiced slowly for health benefits — stress relief, improved balance and flexibility — it can be sped up and used as a fighting form in very advanced classes.
Chinese physicians prescribe tai chi as a gymnastic form of medicine to complement other traditional treatments such as acupuncture and herbs, according to tai chi master Terry Dunn, who helped popularize it in the West.
The movements are working with what is called ""qi"" or life force, a type of ""flow"" that, according to tai chi practitioners, everyone has.
""Within every tai chi movement is the principle of yin and yang. The idea that there is unity within opposites: positive and negative, full and empty, dark and light, hard and soft, cause and effect,"" writes Dunn.
Each posture has a classical Chinese name, such as ""Wave Hands Like Clouds,"" ""Golden Rooster Stands on One Leg,"" ""High Pat the Horse,"" ""White Crane Cools Its Wings"" and ""Shoot Tiger with Bow.""
Beyond just the forms, there is sparring called ""push hands,"" in which two practitioners try to unbalance one another by redirecting the other's energy.
Though studies show that most of those who practice tai chi are 50 years old and up, several instructors report a renewed interest among younger folks looking for an antidote to stress.
Young practitioners looking for peace
York does tai chi three times a week, which he says helps him be more patient and go with the flow.
""I live in Southern California, so driving on the freeways, it can be tempting to rush through traffic and go as fast as you can,"" he said. ""But since I've been doing tai chi, I've been able to stop and pull back and just be like 'all right, here I am in the flow. I'm going to go with it, and if it's slow, that's OK.' ""
It also helps him be more patient in his job as classroom aide for special-needs children.
""A couple of times I have guided them through some breathing exercises, and within minutes, they're more focused. I'm more relaxed, they're more relaxed, and we're able to move on to the lessons,"" York said.
Dunn, who has been teaching tai chi in Los Angeles for more than three decades, says that in the past year and a half, he's gotten an uptick in calls from young men in the tech industry.
He gives private lessons to 20 people, including one young man who works for eHarmony and another for Yahoo.
""Computer tech people, they love tai chi. It's a good destresser for them: sitting hours behind a keyboard, hunched over doing programming,"" Dunn said. ""A lot of these people are more introverted. They like that gentle nature of tai chi that doesn't have sparring and hitting bags.""
Google headquarters has been offering tai chi to its employees for the past couple of years.
Master David Chang, owner of the Wushu Central Martial Arts Academy in San Jose, says he has several students in their 20s and 30s.
""It used to be all senior citizens. It was uncommon for anyone younger than 30 learning tai chi. I've seen it's shifted quite a bit.""
Chang, 41, says those students are looking for both a good source of exercise and something to relieve stress.
""We have some students working in high-tech companies, environmental site analysis, another in air-conditioning repair. It goes across the board,"" Chang said.
Tai chi slowness is deceptive
""Tai chi has a stigma of being for old people because it's slow. Tai chi is great for young people because it helps you to develop that slowness, which can be very beneficial in the world when things are stressful,"" York said.
He says that although it's practiced slowly, it's not easy.
""The slowness of tai chi is deceptive. It's more difficult to remain slow and connected to the breath.""
""Each movement uses almost every muscle. So when we're standing and we're in a form and we're centered low — the legs are engaged, the torso, the arms — everything's engaged but not stressed like it would be in a workout in the gym. My legs have become much stronger.""
Taniela Irizarry, 37, says it helps with her injuries from years of beating up her body as a professional dancer. She too practices it outside on Signal Hill.
""At first, it does seem a little difficult to slow yourself down at that point. But once you do, you realize that it's so calming and it's so relaxing. I just feel like everything just kind of releases,"" Irizarry said.
""You feel the wind blowing through. Sometimes, maybe it's the energy we're creating, but little bees, butterflies and birds come zipping around us,"" she said.
May guard against inflammation, chronic disease
Most health research into the benefits of tai chi focus on people over 50. But the earlier you start in life, the more you reap the rewards, says Dr. Michael Irwin, director of UCLA's Mindful Awareness Research Center. He says the benefits are cumulative.
""A younger person that's experiencing stress, there's a way for them to target that stress so that it does not accumulate over time — increasing the likelihood of them developing disease.""
Irwin has carried out more than a dozen peer-reviewed studies evaluating the ability of tai chi, yoga and mindfulness to improve health outcomes.
Irwin's earliest tai chi study in 2003 found an increase in the number of disease-fighting ""T cells"" that fight off shingles in patients who practiced tai chi. The 15-week study showed no increase in those who did not participate.
In a later study, Irwin found that practicing tai chi gave the same immunity boost as a vaccine developed for shingles.
In 2015, a study found that tai chi, over several weeks, reduced cellular inflammatory responses in patients suffering from insomnia, Irwin says.
""As we age, we find you can be more at risk for an infectious disease, or you can be more at risk for an inflammatory disorder,"" he said. ""Tai chi importantly impacts both elements of the immune system. It improves our ability to fight off infectious disease. It also decreases our inflammation. ""
Irwin is now studying whether tai chi can be as effective as cognitive behavioral therapy to treat depression and anxiety.
What makes it so effective?
What is is about tai chi that is so impactful on our health?
""We simply don't know, but we have various clues,"" Irwin said. ""What happens when you practice tai chi: We're slowly moving, but we also have to be present in this moment — not tomorrow, not yesterday, but in this moment.""
He adds that this is true not just for tai chi but for other mindfulness practices such as yoga and meditation.
""Being present in the moment turns off these kinds of stories that we tell ourselves, that our brain tells our body. When we're telling all these stories about all these horrible things that have been happening to us, we get an activation of these stress response pathways,"" Irwin said. ""So being present in the moment helps us maintain a sense of calmness but also short-circuits activation of these stress pathways.""
'We need a practice ... that allows us to slow down'
At the end of the tai chi class on Long Beach's Signal Hill, York says he brings his practice with him everywhere he goes.
""If I'm feeling agitated, it's a good lesson for me to remember to slow down and tune in with my breath. I do tai chi to get back into myself and to my center, because throughout the week, the world will pull us in different directions,"" York said.
""I think tai chi is great for younger people because it forces you to disconnect from the world around you.""
Hoover agrees.
""We all need a practice, whether it's tai chi or something else, that allows us to slow down.""

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippine government will demand a refund of 3.5 billion pesos ($69.5 million) from vaccine maker Sanofi Pasteur and look at possible legal action after a study showed the vaccine used in a dengue immunization program could expose some people to severe illness, the health chief said Friday.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the government will also seek compensation for treatment of children who may develop severe dengue. No deaths have been confirmed, but at least one immunized child has developed dengue.
The Department of Health put on hold its dengue immunization drive, which was launched last year and is the world's first such public program, after France-based Sanofi Pasteur released the study last week.
A small group of protesters called on the government to take action against the health secretaries who supported the vaccination program under the previous and current administrations in a rally at the Department of Health in Manila. The protesters brought a 12-year-old boy who they said received the dengue vaccine.
Former Health Secretary Janette Garin told ABS-CBN TV that there was no warning given by Sanofi in her time that the dengue vaccine Dengvaxia carried a risk for those who have not been infected. She said she was ready to face a Senate investigation next week.
More than 730,000 public school children aged 9 and above in three Philippine regions with high rates of dengue fever have received at least the first dose of Dengvaxia, the first licensed dengue vaccine.
Sanofi Pasteur said its long-term follow-up study of the vaccine showed sustained benefits for up to six years for those who had a previous dengue infection, but that people who never had dengue had an increased risk of a severe case and hospitalization from the third year after immunization.
""We will demand the refund of the 3 billion paid for the Dengvaxia and that Sanofi set up an indemnification fund to cover the hospitalization and medical treatment for all children who might have severe dengue,"" Duque said at a news conference, adding that a government legal team will also look into Sanofi's accountability.
The pharmaceutical giant initially claimed that the vaccine was safe and effective for all people aged 9 to 45, but later acknowledged that it ""is not recommended for people who have had no prior dengue infection"" due to the risk of a severe case, Duque said.
At least one 12-year-old from northern Tarlac province developed dengue after being immunized but recovered, Duque said, although he did not say if Dengvaxia caused the infection.
Another possible dengue case was being investigated, he said.
Sanofi Pasteur said Friday it's working with Philippine authorities to address fears and share new information about the vaccine, and will cooperate in an ongoing review of the public vaccination program.
Duque said the Philippines will wait for a recommendation to be released next week by a group of immunization experts who provide advice to the World Health Organization.
WHO says about half the world's population is at risk of dengue, with a recent estimate indicating 390 million infections per year.
Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection found in tropical and subtropical climates worldwide. It is a flu-like disease that can cause joint pain, nausea, vomiting and a rash and can cause breathing problems, hemorrhaging and organ failure in severe cases.

MOCOA, Colombia (AP) — Townspeople desperately searched their ruined homes and the local hospital for loved ones Sunday after a torrent of water, mud and debris swept through a city in southern Colombia, causing more than 200 deaths, many of them children, and leaving hundreds more missing and injured.
Neighborhoods were left strewn with rocks, wooden planks, tree limbs and brown muck after heavy rain caused the three rivers that surround Mocoa to rise up and surge through the city of 40,000 Friday night and early Saturday as people slept. The deluge smashed houses, tore trees out by the roots and washed cars and trucks away.
Search-and-rescue teams combed through the debris and helped people who had been clawing at huge mounds of mud by hand. Many had little left to search.
""People went to their houses and found nothing but the floor,"" said Gilma Diaz, a 42-year-old woman from another town who came to search for a cousin.
President Juan Manuel Santos, who visited Mocoa for a second straight day Sunday, declared the area a disaster zone and said the death toll stood at 210. But that could still rise because authorities said there were more than 200 injured, some in critical condition and people were continuing to locate remains in the debris. The president said on Twitter that 170 of the dead had been identified.
Dozens stood in the door of a hospital, hoping for news of family members who were not on the list of those confirmed dead or injured. Others frantically knocked on relatives' doors, hoping to find someone with information about their loved ones.
The disaster seemed to hit young people particularly hard. Santos said 43 of the dead identified so far were children, perhaps because youngsters were already in bed when the floodwaters struck.
Maria Cordoba, a 52-year-old resident who was trying to wash her belongings in a river, said two of her nephews, ages 6 and 11, were killed when their house was destroyed. ""The mother as well was totally beaten up"" but managed to save her 18-month-old baby, she said.
A rescue worker in an orange jumpsuit emerged from one search area with the body of an infant wrapped in a towel. Not far away, Abelardo Solarte, a 48-year-old resident of Mocoa, held a child's shoe as he helped clear debris.
""You have no idea how many kids there are around here,"" Solarte said.
Jair Echarri, who came from a nearby town to help, also struggled to comprehend the loss of so many children. ""I feel an enormous sadness because it's filled with kids' things, toys, clothes, school books,"" he said. ""I am a father and this breaks my heart.""
Santos said the avalanche of water and debris also destroyed roads and bridges, knocked out power in half of the province of Putumayo, where Mocoa is located, and destroyed the area's fresh water network, creating dangerous and unsanitary conditions.
Mocoa is vulnerable to flooding. It is surrounded by the three rivers in a natural basin created by the surrounding mountains.
The danger has grown worse in recent years because of deforestation, which eliminates some protection from runoff, and because many people built their homes close to the water. But the triggering event was rainfall of more than 5 inches (130 millimeters) that began late Friday.
""The rain fell on Mocoa with an intensity and force that was without precedent and devastating,"" Santos said. ""It rained in two hours what falls in a month in Bogota.""
A 1989 hydrology report for the Agricultural Ministry warned that just such a disaster could happen unless steps were taken to reinforce the riverbanks, channel water away from the town and restore some of the forest. It was not immediately clear why those steps had not been taken.
Juan Chanchi de Ruiz, 74, said the noise of the surging flood woke her up and gave her enough time to get to higher ground. Her house was unscathed, but several neighbors' homes were heavily damaged and many people fled with some of their belongings.
""Around here, there's nobody. Everybody left,"" she said.
Colombian officials pledged aid to rebuild homes, and the attorney general launched an investigation into whether local and national authorities responded adequately to the disaster. Santos also said they would launch a health and vaccination campaign in the city to prevent an outbreak of disease. ""Mocoa needs to rise up from this blow,"" he said. ""And it will.""

SREEPUR, Bangladesh (AP) — The 11-year-old girl, once frightened to go near the water, is practicing how to float in a makeshift swimming pool made of bamboo. As she maneuvers through the water, children surrounding the pool cheer.
This is more than a fun summer splash. She is learning to swim to avoid becoming one of the 50 children who die each day in the hundreds of canals, rivers and streams crisscrossing the delta nation of Bangladesh.
""I was afraid of water, I never thought of jumping into water,"" the girl said. But with swimming skills, ""if we fall into any danger ... we could save our lives.""
Drowning is a major cause of death among youngsters in Bangladesh, claiming up to 18,000 children under the age of 18 every year — and 43 percent of deaths among children under 5, according to a 2011 government survey. One housewife said she is overwhelmed by regret for not ensuring her children could swim, after losing both of her sons and a nephew to a river near their grandfather's village not far from the capital of Dhaka in May.
""All the mothers, my sisters, please, remain alert,"" Samela Begum said, weeping. ""Please teach your sons to swim, otherwise your laps will become empty like mine.""
In an effort to help mothers like Begum, a British charity has partnered with a Bangladeshi research group to offer swimming lessons in this central Bangladeshi farming village for children from poor, rural families.
""We consider swimming as vaccine for preventing children's deaths,"" said Aminur Rahman, a lead researcher with the Dhaka-based Center for Injury Prevention and Research , which also offers swimming lessons in other Bangladeshi villages and in the capital. Similar programs have also been started by other groups in the Philippines and Vietnam.
The British charity — based in Kent and named The Sreepur Village, Bangladesh , after its flagship location — recently added the swimming lessons to its overall program aimed at offering commercial skills to some of the 142 single mothers and their 280 children recruited from across the South Asian nation. The idea for them to share the skills with others once they go back to their communities, especially those in the poorest districts where most child drownings occur midday when parents are away at work.
The mothers and their children live at Sreepur Village for up to three years. The village was established in the 1980s by a British charity worker to help impoverished Bangladeshi women and has modest concrete homes, playgrounds, a clinic and more than 18 acres (8 hectares) of farmland.
""This is not about teaching children to be excellent competitive swimmers,"" said Matthew Silvester, a child development specialist from London who works in the village. ""This is purely a drowning prevention scheme to make sure that our children are protected and have the skills required.""
The program begins with smaller children spending a half-hour splashing around in a 3-foot-deep swimming tank strewn with brightly colored toys. Nearby, in a natural pond, two instructors teach about six older children the basic strokes and survival techniques. A dozen other children wait nearby for their 30-minute turn, some of them jogging, stretching or doing light calisthenics before diving in.
""It's all about confidence,"" said Mukta Tarafder, one of the instructors. ""Those who used to be afraid of water are no longer afraid.""

WEST JORDAN — While we haven't reached the peak of the last three years, the number of cases of the flu is rising.
""Compared to last year, we are definitely on an increase,"" said epidemiologist Ilene Risk of the Salt Lake County Health Department.
The number of influenza cases has risen quickly in the last 10 days in Salt Lake County.
""Last year at this time, we had maybe about 30 to 40 cases reported. We have more than doubled that,"" Risk said.
Statewide, there has been an increase and an even greater rise in Salt Lake County — four deaths and 300 hospitalizations already this season.
""We really have seen the elevation over the last week,"" Risk said.
She said Salt Lake County often reports higher activity because it is vigilant about tracking flu cases, and the metro area typically has an elevated level of influenza.
This year, it's Influenza AH3, which especially hits the elderly.
""When we have AH3 years, we tend to see an increase in the number of hospitalizations,"" Risk said.
She suggests it’s a good year to get a flu vaccine.
""If you get your shot, you will also help protect people around you as well as ensuring that you won't get sick from influenza.""
The vaccine covers the AH3 influenza and gives you about 50 percent better protection than if you don't get the shot.
""If you get vaccinated, within a couple of weeks you're going to have really good protection against the strains that are being circulated,"" Risk said,
She recommends following good hygiene practices: wash your hands frequently; avoid touching your face; if you sneeze or cough, make sure you use a tissue. If you're sick, stay away from others.
The Utah Department of Health also expects to see a rise in its numbers when it releases new data on Wednesday.

DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — The World Health Organization has declared an end to the yellow fever outbreak that killed about 400 people in Congo and Angola, calling it ""one of the largest and most challenging"" in recent years.
The outbreak, first detected in Angola in late 2015, caused 965 confirmed cases and thousands of suspected cases in both countries, the WHO said in a statement Tuesday. Neither country has reported a new confirmed case in the past six months.
Angola in late December declared an end to its outbreak, and Congo made its announcement Tuesday.
The global health agency said more than 30 million people were vaccinated in emergency campaigns to control the outbreak in the two neighboring countries, which have among the world's weakest health systems.
""This unprecedented response exhausted the global stockpile of yellow fever vaccines several times,"" the WHO statement said.
Regional Emergency Director Dr. Ibrahima Soce Fall warned such outbreaks could become more frequent unless coordinated responses are taken ""to vaccinate the population at risk across the region.""
There is no known cure for the mosquito-spread virus, which is easily prevented with vaccines. Once infected, people often fall ill with fever and muscle pain, but many recover after several days. The more toxic phase includes possible bleeding from the eyes, ears and nose, jaundice and organ failure

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Public health authorities on Tuesday declared an outbreak of the highly contagious liver disease hepatitis A in Los Angeles County, the third California region to see significant infections this year.
Health officials reported the outbreak to the county Board of Supervisors, which requested a briefing due to the proximity of LA to San Diego, which has had more than 420 cases and 16 deaths since early this year.
The Los Angeles County outbreak was declared because two of 10 confirmed cases could not be traced back to either San Diego or to Santa Cruz County, some 300 miles (480 kilometers) to the north, where there have been 69 hepatitis A cases since April, the Department of Public Health said.
The two apparently locally acquired infections were the most recent.
""We've met the definition for an outbreak,"" department Director Barbara Ferrer told the board. ""As of this morning we've confirmed that we have two community acquired cases.""
Of the other cases, four had been in San Diego and one had been in Santa Cruz during their exposure period. Three secondary cases occurred in a health care facility in Los Angeles County.
Most of those infected in the outbreaks have been homeless or using illicit drugs. Several people who provide services to the homeless have also been infected.
Los Angeles County Interim Health Officer Dr. Jeffrey Gunzenhauser said vaccination is the best protection against hepatitis A and outreach teams and clinics are offering free vaccine to the homeless, active drug users and people who work with those groups.
The homeless are considered at high risk for infection because of poor sanitation. The latest annual tally found nearly 59,000 homeless people in the nation's most populous county.
Hepatatis A spreads when someone comes in contact with an infected person's feces, sometimes when hands are not properly washed after going to the bathroom or changing diapers and the virus is then spread through food or objects. It can also be spread through sex or by sharing drug paraphernalia.
Health officials say the incubation period ranges from 15 to 50 days, and symptoms include fever, malaise, dark urine, anorexia, nausea and abdominal discomfort, followed by jaundice.
In addition to vaccination and thorough hand washing, medical experts said people should avoid sex with anyone who has hepatitis A, and not share food, drinks, cigarettes, towels, toothbrushes or eating utensils.

SALT LAKE CITY — Utah officials are warning the public to stay away from potentially rabid bats, as well as to vaccinate pets and livestock that may come into contact with the wild animals.
The Utah Department of Agriculture and Food has confirmed eight cases of rabies in bats so far this year, though August and September are peak months for detecting the disease.
""People may not know if they've been exposed,"" said Chelsea Crawford, assistant state veterinarian. She said a person could have been bitten by a rabid bat and not know it because bats have such small teeth.
Potential exposure to the disease can also happen if a bat is found in a home or brought there by a cat or dog, which is fairly common, said Crawford.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that the most common way for people to get rabies in the U.S. is through contact with a bat.
At least one Utah resident recently found a bat in their home, and while it is unknown whether that specific bat tested positive for rabies, Crawford said all cases of potential exposure should be taken seriously.
""Rabies is a serious illness and it is almost always fatal once clinical symptoms are present,"" she said.
The Utah Public Health Laboratory receives hundreds of submissions every year, from residents, as well as members of the Department of Wildlife Resources and veterinarians who are called to handle the wild animals.
Crawford said about 15 to 25 bats test positive for rabies each year in Utah, but all contact with bats can present potential exposure to the disease. Wild carnivores, such as raccoons, skunks, foxes and coyotes are also considered to be at high risk for transmitting rabies.
Signs of rabies include aggression and unusual behavior, foaming at the mouth, no interest in food or water, staggering and paralysis. Wild animals, according to the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food, may also act tame. Bats with rabies may be seen flying around during the daytime or resting on the ground, typically uncharacteristic behaviors for the species. Bats may also show no noticeable signs of disease at all.
People who come into contact with or who are bitten by a bat should immediately wash any wound and, if possible, capture the bat for testing. Testing the animal is the only way to know whether the bite victim needs treatment for potential rabies exposure.
Treatment includes immediate vaccination with several follow-up vaccinations.
Crawford recommends pet owners keep their pets up to date on rabies vaccinations, as many aren't aware how prominent rabies still is.
""It's not an optional thing,"" she said. ""(Rabies) is still out there and it needs to be taken seriously.""",2017-08-10T00:00:00Z,2017,3,14

TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — The biggest U.S.-based drugmaker will change leaders in January when Pfizer Chief Operating Officer Albert Bourla replaces CEO Ian Read, who has led the company for nearly eight years.
Pfizer Inc. said Monday that Read will become executive chairman of Pfizer's board of directors.
The move comes after Pfizer's board in March gave Read an $8 million bonus contingent on boosting Pfizer's stock price and staying on for up to a year. That allowed Read time to groom Bourla, who had been appointed last January to the newly created chief operating officer post.
The maker of Viagra and the advanced breast cancer drug Ibrance has been dealing for several years with declining revenue as patents expired and generic competition began for a series of big-selling drugs, as have many other drugmakers. For Pfizer, those drugs include Viagra, blood pressure pill Norvasc and high-cholesterol pill Lipitor, which had reigned as the world's top-selling drug for nearly a decade.
The success of Ibrance, other recent cancer drugs and pneumococcal vaccine Prevnar 13 have revenue growing again, and Pfizer shares have risen about 22 percent so far this year.
Read, who started working at Pfizer in 1978 as an auditor, spent much of his tenure as CEO trying to pull off mega-acquisitions, the strategy that had enabled Pfizer to leapfrog to the top among U.S. drugmakers. But Read failed on deals to acquire first Allergan and then AstraZeneca, primarily to be able to move Pfizer's headquarters — just on paper — to lower-tax countries in Europe.
The New York company said in July that it was again reshaping its business, this time into three units: Innovative Medicines; Established Medicines, which handles older drugs that have lost protection; and Consumer Healthcare. It said Innovative Medicines will bring in most of the company's revenue and has strong growth potential, due partially to an aging population that will create growing demand for new medicines.
A couple of weeks after announcing the business reorganization, Pfizer reported a second-quarter profit that surged 26 percent in a performance that beat Wall Street expectations.
But Pfizer drew the ire of President Donald Trump in early July when it announced price hikes for about 40 of its drugs — shortly after Trump promised without any grounds that drug companies would be announcing ""massive"" voluntary price cuts by mid-June. Those cuts never came and most drugmakers have continued to hike prices, but Trump publicly shamed Pfizer on Twitter for its increases, leading the company to reverse them, but only until January at the latest.
The 56-year-old Bourla just became chief operating officer in January. He also has run the drugmaker's vaccines, oncology and consumer health care business.
Read, 65, became CEO in December 2010 and has served as board chairman since 2011.
When he took over, Pfizer's share price was just $16.72, after steadily declining by more than one-third during the 4 ½-year tenure of his predecessor, Jeffrey Kindler — a key reason Pfizer's board forced Kindler out suddenly.
On Monday, Pfizer shares climbed 20 cents to $44.27.

BEIJING (AP) — Chinese leaders are scrambling to shore up public confidence and oversight of the pharmaceutical industry after a rabies vaccine maker was found faking records, the latest in a slew of public health and safety scandals that have outraged Chinese parents.
Premier Li Keqiang said in a statement Sunday that Changchun Changsheng Life Sciences Ltd., which is accused of fabricating production and inspection records, ""violated a moral bottom line."" He pledged an immediate investigation of the company and to ""resolutely crack down"" on violations that endanger public safety.
President Xi Jinping echoed those remarks, while police in Changchun, a city in northeastern China, announced that the company's chief executive and four other executives had been placed under investigation.
Li's remarks were aimed at assuaging Chinese parents who complain about worrying over fake food, milk and medicine in a society that seems to lack a ""moral bottom line"" — and also competent, uncorrupt regulators.
""Defective vaccines are like child abuse and trafficking — it touches on the most sensitive, vulnerable part of the public's hearts,"" wrote Xi Po, a columnist for The Paper, a popular online news outlet backed by the Shanghai government. ""But unlike in cases of child abuse, the vaccine scandals involve layers and layers of broken regulators and interest groups.""
There were no reports of injuries due to the rabies vaccine, but the disclosure has ricocheted around social media, touching a raw nerve for Chinese parents. Two years ago, a similar scandal erupted after police broke up a criminal ring that had sold millions of faulty baby vaccines — but did not disclose the case for months.
Regulators announced last week that Changchun Changsheng, China's second-largest rabies vaccine manufacturer, was ordered to stop production and recall its rabies vaccine. Days later, provincial authorities in northeast China announced that batches of DPT, or diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus, vaccine were found to be defective. More than 250,000 doses of the DPT vaccine had been sold, China's state broadcaster reported.
Public anger ratcheted up swiftly over the weekend following a report by an anonymous author disclosing that regulators found production problems at Changchun Changsheng as early as November but did not publicize their findings or announce a recall until July. The post was widely shared and was censored by Sunday even as Chinese leaders launched a public relations response.
In his statement, Li acknowledged the government's lapse and pledged to punish offenders and regulators found in ""dereliction of duty."" State media chimed in, with the China Daily urging the government to handle the matter in a ""transparent manner,"" while the Communist Party-owned Global Times called on authorities to ""follow up on people's security demands, and supervise and regulate more effectively.""
Government censors have employed a relatively light touch, allowing online news outlets like The Paper and Caixin to pursue the story while giving internet users some space to vent their frustration. By Monday afternoon, the hashtag ""Changchun Changsheng makes fake vaccines"" had garnered more than 100 million views on Weibo.
The company's phone lines were busy for several hours on Monday and executives could not be reached for comment.
Yang Yuze, another writer at The Paper, bluntly questioned whether national policies to prop up pharmaceutical companies were ""opening the door"" to corruption.
""The main problem is insufficient regulation, missing regulation, powerless regulation,"" Yang wrote. ""It's easy to see how (lax regulation of the vaccine industry) are fig leafs and excuses for the transaction of money and power.""

TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) — A mission to rebuild the depleted wolf population at Isle Royale National Park is getting underway in Michigan and Minnesota, as specialists prepare to trap six to eight of the predators on the mainland and fly them to the Lake Superior archipelago, officials said Friday.
The initial relocation this fall is part of a three-year plan to place 20 to 30 gray wolves in the island wilderness, where since the late 1940s the species has helped preserve ecological balance by keeping the moose herd in check.
Inbreeding, disease and accidental deaths caused a sharp drop-off of wolves in recent years, leading the National Park Service to plan a rescue as a warming climate prevented formation of winter ice bridges that previously enabled natural migration to the island. Only two wolves remain.
Wolves targeted for movement to Isle Royale will be taken from populations in Michigan's Upper Peninsula and the Grand Portage Band of Lake Superior Chippewa reservation in northeastern Minnesota, park Superintendent Phyllis Green said. Officials also hope to get wolves from the Canadian province of Ontario in the future, she said.
""We're looking forward to a safe and successful translocation,"" Green said in a phone conference with reporters from the park headquarters in Houghton, Michigan.
The operation will involve about 30 scientists, pilots and technicians from federal, state and tribal agencies. They'll have a delicate task of selecting healthy, genetically diverse wolves, preparing them for the journey and transporting them safely to the park, which lies about 14 miles (22.5 kilometers) off the Minnesota coast and 60 miles (96.5 kilometers) from the Upper Peninsula.
Mainland wolves will be caught in leg traps, anesthetized and examined for suitability. Preferred are those aged 1 to 5 years — ideal for reproduction — with clear eyes and strong canine teeth needed for killing and eating moose, said Mark Romanski, the park's natural resources chief. Disqualifying flaws could include bone fractures, missing limbs, heartworm and mange. Equal numbers of males and females will be sought.
Park service veterinarian Michelle Verant will conduct blood and feces tests to make sure a candidate is free of diseases that could lower survival prospects and infect the island's population. Those chosen for relocation will be vaccinated, de-wormed and treated for prevention of fleas, ticks and lice.
Isle Royale has no airport, so the wolves will be flown aboard floatplanes that can land on the water and taxi to shoreline docks. In some cases, boats may be needed to get them from aircraft to land.
It will be stressful for the wolves, and officials acknowledged there are risks. But mortality rates have become extremely low over the years as scientists have refined techniques for capturing and moving wolves, Romanski said.
The wolves will be placed in different sections of the park, which is 45 miles (72.4 kilometers) long and includes one large island and hundreds of smaller ones. The animals will be fitted with radio collars, enabling scientists to trace their movements, life spans, pack formation and success with hunting and mating.
The newcomers will be placed well away from the territory occupied by the two survivors.
The wolf restoration, a departure from the usual federal policy of non-interference with natural systems in designated wilderness areas, is intended to prevent a runaway moose herd from overeating the island's trees and shrubs.
""It's possible that moose could do a lot of long-term damage to the forest,"" said John Vucetich of Michigan Technological University, one of the scientists who have observed wolf-moose dynamics at Isle Royale since the 1950s.

BENI, Congo (AP) — The second-deadliest Ebola outbreak in history is ""certainly"" expected to continue for another three or four months, Congo's health minister said Thursday.
In an interview with The Associated Press, Health Minister Oly Ilunga also sought to calm concerns days ahead of a presidential election in which millions of people will use touch-screen voting machines. The deadly Ebola virus is spread via infected bodily fluids, so some worry they may pick it up from the screens.
The minister said precautions have been taken. Several tons of hand sanitizer have been deployed for use in polling stations throughout the outbreak zone in eastern Congo, and voters are being encouraged to sanitize their hands before and after using the machines.
So far there have been 549 Ebola cases in the outbreak that was declared on Aug. 1, including 501 confirmed cases. There have been 278 confirmed deaths.
This Ebola outbreak is the most complex in history amid attacks by rebel groups, the health minister said. But in an upbeat development, he sees ""clear, clear, clear improvement"" in community response to Ebola containment efforts.
The response in wary places like Beni, where more than 1,000 people have been killed in rebel attacks in recent years, has at times been harsh, with some health workers attacked. This is the first time that eastern Congo has faced an Ebola outbreak, and responders have raced to combat rumors and misunderstandings.
There are still risks of confrontation every time the virus spreads into a new area, the health minister said. But ""we can notice today that there is an acceptance, in general, an engagement in the community.""
Ebola's possible spread into so-called ""red zones,"" where the threat of rebel attack makes response work almost impossible, remains a concern.
The minister said his biggest worries continue to be Ebola's possible spread to other major cities in eastern Congo, such as Goma near the Rwanda border, and across the heavily traveled border into Uganda, which already has begun giving frontline health workers an experimental Ebola vaccine.
Uganda is the focus of ""intense collaboration"" with health officials there, the minister said.
He said that every time a new case of Ebola is declared, health officials must allow about 60 days from that date, with no new occurrences, before the outbreak can be considered over.

LONDON (AP) — The World Health Organization says there is ""cautious optimism"" that the Ebola outbreak in Congo may be winding down.
In a report issued this week, the U.N. health agency and Congolese officials say that slightly over a month into the response, further spread of the lethal virus has ""largely been contained.""
WHO says the situation in urban areas — where officials had feared transmission might take off — has remained calm for the last several weeks. Attention since then has been focused on remote rural regions mostly accessible only by dirt roads and motorbikes.
To date, there have been 38 confirmed cases, including 14 deaths.

KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — Congo's latest outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus is over, the health ministry announced Tuesday, after a speedy response to limit its spread in remote rural areas and a city of more than 1 million people.
Health experts said the use of a still-experimental vaccine on more than 3,300 people was a major factor in containing the outbreak, Congo's ninth since the hemorrhagic fever was first identified in 1976.
There were 54 Ebola cases, including 33 deaths, in the outbreak that was declared in early May in northwest Equateur province, the health ministry said.
""Although the scale of the crisis we were facing was unprecedented, the speed and effectiveness of the response put in place by the government and its partners were also exceptional,"" Health Minister Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga said.
The outbreak posed a serious challenge when it spread to the city of Mbandaka and its more than 1 million residents. The other initial cases were in hard-to-reach rural areas without basic infrastructure such as electricity, making the vaccination efforts more difficult.
""From the start, we had prepared for the worst of scenarios,"" the health minister said. ""And our fears were quickly confirmed"" with the spread to Mbandaka early on in the outbreak.
The city sits on the heavily traveled Congo River upstream from the capital, Kinshasa, and its 10 million residents. There were concerns the virus would spread not only within the country but to neighboring nations including Central African Republic.
The outbreak was declared over after a 42-day observation period, equaling two 21-day incubation periods, with no new confirmed cases recorded.
""It's a great relief for us,"" said Dominique Ekila, a 44-year-old resident of Kinshasa. ""Since May, I had stopped traveling to Equateur province to sell fish ... With this announcement I will soon plan my next trip.""
Esther Mavinga, who sells vegetables in Kinshasa, said she was grateful the outbreak was over.
""We were very worried that this epidemic would come to Kinshasa. The God we prayed to heard our prayers and spared us,"" she said.
There is no specific treatment for Ebola, which is spread via contact with the bodily fluids of those infected, including the dead. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain and at times internal and external bleeding. The virus can be fatal in up to 90 percent of cases, depending on the strain.
The World Health Organization, which played a major role in the outbreak response and delivery of the vaccines, congratulated Congo.
Dr. Ibrahima Soce Fall, the agency's regional emergencies director in Africa, called the response vastly improved after the devastating Ebola outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,300 people from 2014 to 2016. WHO, criticized for its slow response, went through a ""profound reform"" after that, he said.
The same day the latest outbreak was declared, WHO was able to release $2 million allocated for the initial response and international teams were able to deploy quickly in a coordinated effort, Fall said.
But Dr. Stacey Mearns, senior health coordinator of the International Rescue Committee's emergency response team, warned against too much celebration.
""It's always good to see the end of an outbreak, but it's certainly not the end of Ebola in Congo. Ebola is endemic here,"" she said.

NEW YORK (CNN) — Thirty-four percent of U.S. parents said their child was unlikely to get the flu vaccine this year, according to a report published Monday by C.S. Mott Children's Hospital.
The online poll, which was administered in October, looked at 1,977 parents who had at least one child, whether parents would get their children the flu vaccine and their reasoning, among other things.
Of parents polled, 48 percent said they usually followed the recommendations of their child's health care provider when making choices about the flu vaccine.
However, 21 percent of those surveyed did not remember their health care provider making a recommendation about their child receiving the flu shot.
""To me, the biggest takeaway is that there is a group of parents who look like they have a gap in expert guidance around whether kids should get flu vaccines, specifically whether their kid should get flu vaccine,"" said Sarah Clark, co-director of the C.S. Mott Children's Hospital National Poll on Children's Health at the University of Michigan.
Parents who were making the choice to get their child vaccinated reported hearing more positive than negative comments, by a margin of about 4-to-1, whereas those who chose not to vaccinate their children heard a lot more negative commentary, Clark said.
During the last flu season, 179 children died, with hundreds hospitalized due to flu-related illnesses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC also reported that 80 percent of the children who died were unvaccinated.
The CDC said last flu season, 57.9 percent of children between the ages of 6 months and 17 years received flu vaccines, less than the year before. Approximately 155.3 million doses of flu vaccine were distributed to people of all ages last season.
""We don't give the flu vaccine the credit it deserves,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.
""The vaccine is not perfect, none of us believe it is, but it's the best thing we have for preventing influenza, and even if it doesn't prevent the illness completely, and this is very important, it tends to make the illness milder,"" said Schaffner, who was not involved in the new report.
Some of the reasons parents give for not vaccinating their children include being too busy and not getting strong recommendations from their medical providers, according to Schaffner.
In the poll, the top three reasons parents cited for not getting their children vaccinated, according to Clark, were that they were concerned about side effects, that it doesn't work very well and that their currently healthy child does not need to be vaccinated.

CHICAGO (AP) — Doctors have long known that separating families and other traumatic events can damage children's well-being. More recent research has shed some light on how that may happen: Severe early adversity may cause brain changes and ""toxic stress,"" resulting in lasting psychological and physical health problems.
A ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy announced this spring by the Trump Administration has separated 2,300 children from the adults they were traveling with and sent them to shelters and foster homes across the country, according to the government. The administration has 30 days to reunite families, but it remains unclear whether it can meet that deadline.
Here's what evidence shows this kind of separation can do and how some experts think immigrant children may be at risk.
THE STRESS RESPONSE
Stress is a normal response to challenging or threatening circumstances that cause the brain to trigger the body's ""fight or flight"" mode. Stress hormones and chemicals are released that increase heart rate, blood pressure, alertness and energy levels.
Levels typically return to normal when the threat passes.
When the threat is ongoing — a result of things like war, famine, poverty, natural disasters, family discord or neighborhood violence — the stress system may remain on high alert, sometimes triggering anxiety, behavior problems, stomach aches, sleep problems and other mental and physical symptoms.
Experts believe that contact with a loving, nurturing parent or caregiver can help children weather stress and reduce chances for lasting ill effects. A recent U.S. study of toddlers from families living in poverty is an example. Youngsters who had a strong parent relationship had lower stress-hormone levels when they arrived at a clinic to get vaccinations than those without that parent buffer.
WHAT'S TOXIC STRESS?
Scientists increasingly believe that persistent stress, particularly when there's no nurturing parent to help kids cope, can cause stress hormones and internal inflammatory markers to smolder at elevated levels, raising risks for later heart disease, diabetes and other health problems.
The science is not settled, but some studies also have shown that persistent stress may alter brain structure in regions affecting emotions and regulating behavior. Imaging studies have found these regions are smaller than usual in severely traumatized children.
Harvard University neuroscientist Charles Nelson says children younger than 3, with rapidly developing brains, are most at risk for the toxic effects of ongoing stress. In his imaging studies, school-aged Romanian orphans sent to live with foster families had brains with less gray matter than orphans sent to nurturing foster homes before age 2.
WHAT ABOUT MIGRANT CHILDREN?
Central American children arriving with their families at the southern U.S. border have already endured the trauma of leaving their homes, some after violence or other threats, and faced the additional trauma of an arduous journey north, Nelson said Wednesday. ""That may increase their susceptibility to the hazards of separation at the border,"" he said.
Nelson said the images he's seen of U.S. detention centers housing children remind him of his research with Romanian children. In a recent research newsletter, Nelson wrote, ""The lessons we learned then taught us that housing children in institution-like settings, with rotating shifts of caregivers and unfavorable ratios of caregivers to children, may cause severe and permanent damage to their minds and bodies.""
""This is what science has taught us about separation,"" he said Wednesday.
WHAT DOCTORS SAY
In 2017, a year before the separation policy was announced, the American Academy of Pediatrics advised against holding migrant children in detention centers and said they should receive health care and treatment to ""support their well-being.""
The academy and several mental health groups recently denounced the separation policy and cautiously supported last week's executive order to overturn it. Tuesday's order from a federal judge mandating that thousands of families be reunited within 30 days is an important step, the academy said in a joint statement with UNICEF USA, but it won't undo the trauma separated children have already faced, said Academy President Dr. Colleen Kraft.
Even if they are eventually reunited, these families will need ""trauma-informed"" care to help them cope, Kraft said.
In their statement Wednesday, the academy and UNICEF USA said their organizations ""stand ready to assist in reunifying families and supporting their needs. Pediatricians across the country are prepared to provide care for immigrant children as they enter our communities.""
Kraft attempted to enter a children's shelter in McAllen, Texas on Wednesday to see what attempts were being made to reunite children and parents but said authorities turned her away. During an April visit to the same shelter, Kraft saw children who were ""eerily quiet"" and one who was crying inconsolably while attendants watched.
""Staff in the room were not allowed to pick her up and hold her,"" Kraft said. It's that kind of absence of nurturing contact that experts think worsens the effects of traumatic stress.

LONDON (AP) — While parts of the world have all but banished measles, Europe is still getting hit with large outbreaks where some people don't get vaccinated.
Measles is still a bigger problem across parts of Africa and Asia, where outbreaks can be particularly devastating in malnourished children or those with other illnesses like tuberculosis or AIDS. Most of the 89,000 measles deaths in the world each year are in developing countries.
In Europe, there were more than 21,000 cases of measles and 35 deaths last year, a fourfold increase in cases compared to the previous year. With more than 5,000 cases each, Romania and Italy had the biggest epidemics — and the drive to vaccinate children against measles has even become a leading issue in Italy's general election on Sunday.
A look at some of the hurdles slowing efforts to stop the spread of this preventable disease:
___
WHY DOES MEASLES SPREAD SO FAST?
Measles is among the world's most contagious diseases. The virus is spread in the air through coughing or sneezing.
It can be prevented with a vaccine that's been in use since the 1960s. Health officials say that vaccination rates of at least 95 percent are needed to prevent epidemics.
In some regions of Italy, the rate is about 85 percent, one of the lowest in Europe. Epidemics have also emerged in countries including Ukraine, Greece and Romania, where officials have noted declines in overall vaccination coverage, problems with the vaccine supply and poor disease surveillance systems.
___
WHY IS EUROPE A HOTBED FOR MEASLES?
Vaccine skepticism remains high in many parts of Europe after past immunization problems.
In France, a national hepatitis B vaccination campaign that was suspended in 1998 amid concerns of bad side effects led to widespread wariness of immunizations.
And during the 2009 swine flu pandemic, numerous European critics alleged that the push for swine flu vaccinations was the result of drugmakers' undue influence on the World Health Organization.
A 2016 global survey of vaccine confidence led by researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found Europe to be the region that was least confident in vaccine safety.
___
WHY IS THE VACCINE CONTROVERSIAL?
In 1998, British researcher Dr. Andrew Wakefield published a paper in the medical journal Lancet suggesting a link between the combo measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccine and autism.
No other studies have found any connection. The paper was later retracted, 10 of its co-authors renounced its conclusions and Wakefield was stripped of his license to practice medicine in the U.K. after officials found him guilty of ""serious professional misconduct.""
After the paper was published, however, vaccination rates dropped in Britain, the U.S. and elsewhere, leading to years of measles epidemics across Europe. In the U.K., at least a dozen medical associations including the Royal College of Physicians have issued statements verifying the safety of the MMR vaccine.
___
HOW EFFECTIVE IS THE VACCINE?
A full dose of the MMR vaccine, a standard component of routine childhood immunization in many countries, is believed to be about 97 percent effective at preventing measles.
Measles typically begins with a high fever and also causes a rash on the face and neck. While most people who get measles recover, it's one of the leading causes of death among young children, according to the WHO.
Serious complications, including blindness and a swelling of the brain, are more common in young children and adults over age 30. Through vaccination programs, measles has been eliminated in the Americas and many other countries have pledged to stop the disease's spread by 2020.
___
HOW CAN VACCINATION RATES BE INCREASED?
One strategy is to make immunization against certain diseases legally mandatory and not allow children to attend school unless they can show proof of vaccination.
Italy recently introduced a new law requiring parents to vaccinate their children against measles and nine other childhood diseases. Romania also passed a similar bill, including hefty fines for parents who didn't vaccinate their children.
Similar laws exist elsewhere: after an outbreak of measles at Disneyland in California, the U.S. state changed its laws to make it more difficult for parents to have their children opt out of being vaccinated. That ultimately led to higher rates of vaccination.
High rates are needed to induce ""herd immunity,"" to help protect vulnerable people like infants too young to be vaccinated and people who can't be vaccinated for medical reasons, like those with weak immune systems.

SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazil's yellow fever vaccination efforts have fallen significantly short of their goal, the Health Ministry acknowledged this week, and an official said Friday that more than 16 million people in the targeted population still need to be immunized.
In January, the ministry launched a campaign to vaccinate more than 23 million people in three states affected by the largest outbreak of the mosquito-borne disease in decades. As the outbreak expanded, so, too, did the population officials hoped to reach, and they now want to vaccinate 38 million people in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Bahia states.
But those efforts have been dogged by rumors that the vaccine is unsafe or ineffective, and health officials have struggled to effectively combat that misinformation.
So far, they have only reached 57 percent of the targeted population in three states, leaving more than 16 million people unvaccinated, Carla Domingues, the coordinator of the ministry's national immunization program, said Friday. The ministry had announced in March that it had reached 76 percent of the targeted population, but Domingues said that rate was calculated before the goal was expanded.
The ministry's goal is to reach 95 percent of the targeted population since the vaccine won't be appropriate for some people.
Yellow fever has long been endemic in large swaths of Brazil, but it has been advancing in recent years and this is the second outbreak in a row in places where vaccinations for the disease were not routine.
The current outbreak is the largest in more than three decades in Latin America's largest nation. So far, 1,127 people have been infected; of those, 331 have died.
During the 2016-2017 outbreak, more than 770 people were infected after nearly a decade during which Brazil saw fewer than 10 cases each year.
In response to this advance, Brazil decided to offer routine vaccination for the entire country — but it will take about another year to completely roll that out.

SIDI BOUKNADEL, Morocco (AP) — At least seven people died and nearly 80 were injured after a shuttle train linking the Moroccan capital to a town farther north on the Atlantic coast derailed Tuesday, authorities at the accident site said.
The train derailed about halfway between Rabat and the town of Kenitra, near the city of Sale. Tangled in the wreckage were doors and seats that had been gouged out of place, while passengers' belongings and glass from broken windows littered the accident site.
Emergency workers rushed people to hospitals in Rabat, Sale and Kenitra while rescue teams searched for more victims with the help of cadaver dogs. Military personnel guarded the site as railway workers and authorities started to investigate why the train jumped its tracks.
Local residents were the first to reach the scene in the town of Sidi Bouknadel, helping injured or trapped survivors out of mangled train cars and covering the bodies of the dead. They reported the accident happened at around 9:30 a.m.
""We heard a gigantic explosion. The earth shook and the sound was unbearable,"" Mourad El Kbiri, who owns a cafe near where the train derailed, told The Associated Press. ""I rushed to see what happened. It was horrific. Disfigured bodies all over the place, blood and body pieces.""
The Center for Blood Immunization declared a state of emergency and dispatched blood collection vehicles to Rabat, Kenitra, Sale and Sidi Bouknadel to receive donors.
The general director of state-owned railway company ONCF, Mohamed Rabie Khlie, and Morocco's interior and transport ministers visited the accident site briefly but refused to comment.
The Moroccan king, Mohammed VI, offered to pay the costs of victims' funerals out of his own pocket, state news agency MAP reported.

BENI, Congo (AP) — Congo's latest deadly Ebola outbreak has spread into a neighboring province, the health ministry said Tuesday, as health workers began using an experimental treatment for the disease.
Health officials are hoping the mAb114 therapy, isolated from a survivor of an Ebola outbreak in 1995, will be effective in this outbreak that so far has 30 confirmed cases including 14 deaths.
Five patients have been given the treatment, said the World Health Organization's director-general, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Four other experimental treatments have been approved for use, he said.
The outbreak spread from North Kivu province into neighboring Ituri province in Congo's turbulent northeast when a man who had been treated for heart problems in Mangina, where the outbreak was declared Aug. 1, returned home, the health ministry said. He has since died and tests confirmed he had Ebola.
Vaccinations began last week in Mangina and Beni, the major town about 30 kilometers (18 miles) away where Ebola treatment centers have been set up. Health authorities are using what is called a ring vaccination technique in which health workers are vaccinated first, along with contacts of Ebola patients and their contacts.
Seven of the nearly 75 health workers in Mangina have been infected, Tedros said. More than 200 health workers have been vaccinated, along with 20 residents in the Beni region, he said. There are 3,000 vaccine doses in Congo.
The work to contain Ebola is challenged by the presence of several armed groups in the densely populated region close to the Ugandan border. WHO has called for secure access to all affected populations and for the cessation of hostilities.
""The virus is dangerous to us all,"" Tedros said.
There are designated ""red zones"" where health workers cannot go because of the insecurity, raising concerns that cases could easily spread there, he said.
""We are on an epidemiological precipice,"" WHO's emergency preparedness chief, Dr. Peter Salama, said in a Twitter post, with a limited window of opportunity to stop the outbreak from spreading into those areas.
For now the epicenter of the outbreak is in and around Beni so aid workers have been able to move with relative safety, said Jean-Philippe Marcoux, Congo country director for Mercy Corps.
The area around Mangina and Beni, however, is ""almost completely surrounded by armed groups,"" the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement.
North Kivu is densely populated with more than 1 million displaced people, and while this is Congo's tenth Ebola outbreak health officials have said the local population is not familiar with the disease. That makes outreach more challenging.
""The unknown can create more fear,"" Marcoux said.
The WHO chief said the risk of international spread is low. He said officials have been in contact with neighboring Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan.

WEBBVILLE, Ky. (AP) — The owner of a no-kill animal shelter has been arrested on 179 counts of second-degree animal cruelty in Kentucky.
But 67-year-old Randy Skaggs tells the Lexington Herald-Leader he was arrested in retaliation for pushing others to comply with animal-control standards and provide adequate shelters.
Skaggs was part of a 2000 lawsuit accusing dozens of counties of not having required animal control officers or shelters, among other claims. State police couldn't tell the Leader how the Trixie Foundation owner mistreated animals, and the county attorney and animal control officer were unavailable for comment.
Second-degree animal cruelty includes intentionally subjecting animals to ""cruel or injurious mistreatment"" through neglect, among other conditions.
A Thursday state police release says the agency also charged Skaggs with 179 counts of not vaccinating dogs against rabies.

BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — The United Nations says that more than 1.6 million Venezuelans have left their country since the start of 2015, generating an international migrant crisis that has set off alarms in South America and recently led to violent confrontations between migrants and local populations. Here are some facts about Venezuela's migrant crisis.
WHY ARE VENEZUELANS LEAVING?
Most migrants say they are escaping Venezuela's imploding economy. Hyperinflation has decimated wages, and more than a decade of price controls have generated widespread shortages of basic goods. Venezuela's monthly minimum wage is currently worth about $25 and is far below what is needed to feed a family.
WHERE ARE THEY GOING?
More than half of Venezuela's migrants are leaving for neighboring Colombia. But hundreds of thousands also look to settle in countries further south, including Ecuador, Peru and Chile. A smaller portion of the migrants is leaving Venezuela via its remote, southeastern border with Brazil. More than 28,000 also filed asylum petitions in the U.S. last year alone.
WHAT IS THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM?
The United Nations' refugee agency says that around 5,000 people are leaving Venezuela every day. Close to 1 million Venezuelans are already living in Colombia, according to the country's immigration authorities.
By comparison, at the height of Europe's migrant crisis in 2015, Germany took in 900,000 refugees from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Turkey currently houses around 3.5 million Syrian refugees.
WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON OTHER COUNTRIES?
Governments in South America contend that the large influx of Venezuelans is straining social services like schools and hospitals since arriving Venezuelans have no money for food, housing or medical care.
The impoverished northern Brazilian state of Roraima declared a state of emergency last year after 30,000 Venezuelans arrived the state capital, which has a population of just 350,000. Brazil's federal government has sent in the army to provide humanitarian assistance and stem violence between locals and migrants. Ecuador has also declared a state of emergency in three of its provinces.
HOW ARE GOVERNMENTS RESPONDING
Initially neighboring countries facilitated the arrival of Venezuelans by granting temporary work and residence permits. But as the exodus has grown, some have tightened entry requirements. Ecuador and Peru said in August that only Venezuelans with passports could enter their territory, a measure that could bar many would-be migrants from a country where passports are hard to obtain.
The U.N. human rights agency is trying to raise $46 million to assist Venezuelan migrants in South America, while over the past two years the United States has pledged more than $60 million to aid Venezuelans in Colombia. In Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador, governments have set up tents and health stations at their borders where children are vaccinated for free.
WHAT DOES VENEZUELA'S GOVERNMENT SAY?
Venezuela's socialist government denies there is a migrant crisis, with Vice President Delcy Rodriguez recently declaring that images of desperate migrants walking across Colombia were staged by Venezuela's enemies to justify an intervention.
President Nicolas Maduro has urged his country's emigres to ""stop cleaning toilets abroad"" and return home. In August, he sent a plane to Peru to pick up around 100 migrants who he said had been duped into abandoning Venezuela.

DRAPER — Parents of Corner Canyon High School students were notified Thursday by the Salt Lake County Health Department of an outbreak of whooping cough at the school.
The letter directs people with cold symptoms to contact health care providers immediately and to inform them of their possible exposure to pertussis, which is a highly contagious respiratory disease.
To date, there have been five confirmed cases of the disease at the school, according to Salt Lake County Health Department spokesman Nicholas Rupp. Corner Canyon is the only high school in Salt Lake County that has had a pertussis outbreak in 2018, he said.
Among a student body of 2,200 students, about 100 students are exempt from vaccination either because of parental choice, because they cannot receive immunizations due to medical conditions, or because they are undergoing chemotherapy.
""As a health department, we support parental choice. We just have to remind those parents who make this particular choice that the ramifications may be that their student is not able to attend school. For pertussis, it is 21 days after the last student confirmed case is no longer symptomatic,"" Rupp said.
Whooping cough is caused by a bacteria called Bordetella pertussis, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Pertussis is only found in humans and spreads from person to person.
Early symptoms include runny nose, low-grade fever, mild occasional cough, and apnea — temporary stoppage of breathing, especially during sleep — in babies.
After one to two weeks and as the disease progresses, traditional symptoms of pertussis may appear including fits of rapid coughs followed by a high-pitched ""whoop"" sound; vomiting during or after coughing fits and exhaustion after coughing fits, according to the CDC.
Health care providers generally treat pertussis with antibiotics, and early treatment is very important. Babies are at greatest risk for serious complications from pertussis, according to the CDC.
The letter to parents notes that ""individuals who have been fully immunized earlier in life are still susceptible to infection because the pertussis vaccine wears off over time and no longer provides protection.""
According to vaccination guidelines, infants over 6 weeks of age need the DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis) vaccine series to prevent pertussis; preteens over 10 years of age, and all teens and adults, need one Tdap vaccine to prevent tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis, the letter states.
The letter urges parents to contact their child's health care provider or the Salt Lake County Health Department at 385-468-7468 to make appointments for the vaccination.
Anyone in a child's household who is immunocompromised or who has other serious medical problems should consult their primary care physician for recommendations, according to the letter.
For questions, parents or guardians should call their primary care provider or the Salt Lake County Health Department's general information line, 385-468-4100.",2018-03-22T00:00:00Z,2018,1,15

BENI, Congo (AP) — Armed groups, dense populations and mass displacement make Congo's latest deadly outbreak of the Ebola virus more challenging than ever to contain, the World Health Organization's chief said Friday.
Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus spoke after vaccinations began this week, with support from a U.N. peacekeeping mission, in Congo's restive northeast where multiple rebel groups pose a threat and a heavily traveled border with Uganda is nearby.
Tedros and Congo's health minister on Saturday planned to visit the village where the latest outbreak, Congo's tenth, was declared on Aug. 1. The ministry says 48 cases have been reported, 21 of them confirmed as Ebola, including 11 deaths.
This outbreak is different from the one in Congo's northwest that was declared over a week before this one began, Tedros said. ""And that may require actually a stronger response.""
The use of the experimental vaccine and a swift international response were key in stopping the earlier outbreak, which killed 33 people. Health officials are using the same strategy now, first vaccinating health workers, contacts of Ebola cases and their contacts while finding and monitoring nearly 1,000 people so far.
""The vaccination alone cannot help,"" Tedros warned, adding that finding and monitoring people is crucial, along with community awareness programs. WHO has said more than 3,000 doses of the Ebola vaccine are available in Congo.
The region's shifting population poses a challenge. North Kivu province, where most of the cases in the new outbreak have been reported, hosts about 1 million internally displaced persons because of the regional insecurity, according to the U.N.'s migration agency.
The U.N. refugee agency on Friday said Ebola screenings are being carried out at transit points while an estimated 250 to 300 people a day cross into Uganda seeking refuge. Officials have said travel restrictions in response to the outbreak are not necessary.
Some worried Congolese have called for mass vaccinations in the border region, which the health minister said could not be done.
Others want more security.
""We call on the Congolese army to strengthen their presence and guard convoys of aid workers who are treating Ebola in the Beni region,"" pastor Gilbert Kambale told The Associated Press.
Civil society groups have pointed out the threat from Allied Democratic Forces rebels who have killed more than 1,500 people in and around Beni in less than two years.

SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazil is making it easier and cheaper for Americans to apply for a visa following a decline in the number of visitors from the U.S. in recent years.
Starting Thursday, Americans can complete the visa process completely online, instead of visiting a consulate or paying an expeditor to do so. The price of the visa will drop from $160 to $40.
The new e-visa program has already been put in place for Australians, Japanese and Canadians as part of Brazil's efforts to attract more foreign tourists.
South America's biggest country offers a wide variety of destinations for visitors, from eco-tourism in the Amazon rain forest to colonial towns built by the Portuguese to miles and miles of unspoiled beaches. Yet in 2016, Brazil welcomed fewer than 6.6 million foreigners, about half the number that traveled to the city-state of Singapore.
American visits have dropped in recent years. Their numbers fell from approximately 657,000 in 2014 to 576,000 in 2015. In 2016, the year Rio de Janeiro hosted the Olympics, the number fell further to approximately 570,000.
""The federal government for a long time didn't understand the economic importance of tourism: no actions to promote destinations, no partnerships with operators to attract visitors, to diversify tourism,"" Tourism Minister Marx Beltrao said in an interview with The Associated Press this week. ""Tourism became part of the economic agenda just a year and a half ago.""
In addition to implementing the e-visa, Beltrao said the current administration is trying to make travel to and within Brazil cheaper by allowing increased foreign investment in domestic airlines. It is also hoping to quadruple the budget of Embratur, Brazil's tourism board, and is working to overhaul its promotion strategy.
Brazil has very real challenges to confront, including high rates of violent crime in some areas, the steep cost of travelling within the country and repeated disease outbreaks. A Zika outbreak that began in 2015 put off many would-be travelers after the mosquito-borne virus was linked to severe birth defects. This year, a yellow fever outbreak is spreading just weeks before Carnival.
The World Health Organization now recommends foreigners visiting anywhere in Sao Paulo or Rio de Janeiro states get a yellow fever vaccination before traveling, though Beltrao and other Brazilian officials have said urban areas are safe.

BENI, Congo (AP) — Ebola responders are on lockdown in the eastern Congo city of Beni after angry residents attacked a United Nations base to protest repeated rebel assaults, the World Health Organization said Tuesday. At least four protesters were killed, a local official said.
Every day that health workers don’t have full access to Ebola-affected areas is a “tragedy” that prolongs the second-worst Ebola outbreak in history, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Twitter.
No one in the city could be vaccinated against Ebola on Monday, WHO said. The U.N. health agency previously could trace more than 90% of contacts of infected people in Beni but now that figure is just 17%, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.
Almost 50 “non-critical” WHO staffers were evacuated to the city of Goma while 71 remain, spokesman Christian Lindmeier said. He said the violence is not directed at WHO or the Ebola response at large.
Instead, Beni residents are outraged that rebels continue to carry out deadly attacks despite the presence of U.N. peacekeepers and Congolese forces. Some demand that the U.N. mission act or leave.
The bodies of four young protesters were found near the U.N. base after Monday’s attack, Kumbu Ngoma with Beni’s military court told The Associated Press on Tuesday. Investigations continued into the cause of their deaths. Six Congolese soldiers were wounded by gunfire near the base, Ngoma added.
Congo’s President Felix Tshisekedi after an emergency meeting Monday decided to allow joint operations between Congolese and U.N. forces in Beni following the protests that also burned the town hall.
Congo’s military early this month declared a new offensive against Allied Democratic Forces rebels who have killed hundreds of civilians and security forces over the past few years in the mineral-rich northeast.
After the U.N. mission in recent days was accused of inaction, it said it could not carry out operations unilaterally in a region where Congo’s military is already active, and that it cannot participate in Congolese military operations without being invited.
Any unrest in the region where numerous rebel groups are active hurts crucial efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak. The number of reported cases has been dropping, with zero cases recorded on several days this month.
Congo’s president, heartened by the trend, said earlier this month he hoped that the outbreak could be ended “completely by the end of the year.” However, WHO says 42 days without new Ebola cases must pass since the last possible exposure to a confirmed case for an outbreak to be declared over.
More than 3,100 Ebola cases have been confirmed since this outbreak was declared in August 2018, including more than 2,100 deaths.
WHO has called the trend in the declining number of cases encouraging but said the recent days of protests in Beni and surrounding areas are of “grave concern.”

NEW CITY, N.Y. (AP) — Some parents who had resisted having their children vaccinated reluctantly brought them in for a measles shot Wednesday as a state of emergency took effect in a county in New York City's northern suburbs.
Rockland County enacted the emergency order Tuesday night to fight a measles outbreak that has infected more than 150 people since last fall. The order bans unvaccinated children under 18 years old from public places such as schools, stores and churches.
Loreen Costa told the Rockland Journal News she brought her son to his pediatrician for a vaccination Wednesday after getting a robocall from his school explaining the ban. School districts contacted parents of unvaccinated children and told them not to attend classes Wednesday.
Lainie Goldstein of Grandview said her son's middle school principal called her and said the boy can't attend school until he's vaccinated. She said she had chosen not to vaccinate him because she did ""not want to injure"" him, but she brought him to the pediatrician Wednesday for the injection.
""I feel like I am being bullied right now to go get vaccinations,"" she told the Journal News.
About 30 people got measles vaccinations at a free county clinic Wednesday.
""I think that something needs to be done that has to be very drastic, that people need to comply and we've got to stop this,"" said Rockland resident Renee Kahan, who stopped by the clinic for a booster shot. ""This outbreak is serious.""
The emergency order, which lasts for 30 days, was enacted because people weren't cooperating with health officials working to stop the outbreak, said Rockland County attorney Thomas Humbach.
Humbach said police won't be stopping people and asking for vaccination records. But if officials become aware that an unvaccinated person has been in a public place, law enforcement will get involved, he said. Violators could be charged with a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail.
Gary Siepser, CEO of the Jewish Federation and Foundation of Rockland County, said the disease's spread was related to the anti-vaccine movement across the country.
""It has found its way through social media and confused parents and confused people about the importance of vaccination,"" Siepser said. ""And it just happens that there's a group in Rockland County that has bought into that.""

Headed on a once-in-a-lifetime anniversary vacation to a faraway island? How about a church mission to the tropics or a business trip to a developing country? Christie Kelts, LPN, has got you covered.
On any given day, Kelts — a licensed practical nurse at the University of Utah Health Travel Clinic — can rattle off the disease outbreaks occurring in countries around the globe. If there’s a malaria epidemic in the Dominican Republic or a dysentery problem in Mozambique, Kelts and her colleagues likely know all about it.
At the university’s travel clinic, jet-setters are prepared for safe and healthy forays into the potentially contagious world.
Kelts informs patients about the countries they’re planning to visit — including precautions they need to be taking. She discusses possible dangers associated with crime, tips for combating jet lag, or even the potential for catching a disease while swimming.
“We don’t just give them shots and send them on their way. We talk about all the risks that are involved in travel,” Kelts said.
Kelts takes 30-45 minutes to educate each patient. Depending on the destination, travel risks may include everything from contracting a deadly virus to, more likely, being forced to deal with a very un-fun stomach situation.
I tell people ‘You didn’t pay money to visit the hotel bathroom, and if you aren’t careful, that’s where you’re going to spend it.'
“I tell people ‘You didn’t pay money to visit the hotel bathroom, and if you aren’t careful, that’s where you’re going to spend it,’” Kelts said.
You guessed it: Diarrhea is the most common travel illness, and there are two varieties. The less severe type is the aptly named “travelers’ diarrhea,” a non-bloody, watery diarrhea that is accompanied by mild abdominal pain but no fever. It accounts for 80% of all diarrhea cases among travelers and can occur after ingesting unsanitary food or water or even because an individual is simply not accustomed to the cuisine of a different country.
“It’s a survival mechanism,” Kelts said. “In case we do eat something bad, our system flushes it out.”
The other 20% get dysentery diarrhea with symptoms including severe abdominal cramping, fever, and diarrhea that may or may not be bloody. This more unpleasant version is caused by bacteria infecting the intestines.
When it comes to avoiding foodborne illness, the travel clinic has a simple mantra: If you can’t cook it, boil it or peel it, don’t eat it. Other rules of thumb: Avoid raw fruits and vegetables, unpasteurized dairy products, and cold salsa, salads and sushi that have been left at room temperature.
“It’s also important to note that foods that are served in more expensive restaurants aren’t necessarily safer,” Kelts said.
Kelts recommends eating foods that are well-cooked, canned food that has just been opened, bread and other dry products, and raw fruits and vegetables that have been peeled. When eating uncooked fruits and veggies that can’t be peeled, it’s important to soak them in a solution of one liter of water combined with one teaspoon of bleach for 30 seconds. Wash with boiled, bottled or filtered water before eating.
When experiencing diarrhea, it’s vital to drink lots of water to replenish lost fluids. Travelers’ diarrhea typically resolves in 2-7 days without additional treatment. If dehydration is severe, Kelts recommends a balanced salt solution. Bring along powder sport drink/electrolyte mixes or use the following recipe: 1 quart or liter of water + ½ teaspoon of table salt + 2 tablespoons of sugar.
In addition to offering safe eating advice and making sure patients are adequately immunized, Kelts and team inform patients about insect precautions, motion sickness, altitude sickness, and blood clots and can even answer questions about traveling with children, traveling while pregnant, and personal safety.
If a traveler picks up a bug while overseas, the clinic is equipped with physicians who are able to diagnose and determine treatments for individuals when they return home.
Knowing what to expect in advance helps travelers to embark on their journey without worrying about potential health care issues, allowing them to focus on the most important opportunities afforded by international travel — experiencing new countries and cultures.
A bonus for sure.

NEW YORK (AP) — Health officials say this year's U.S. measles epidemic has surpassed 1,000 illnesses.
It's already the highest in 27 years.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated the count Wednesday, saying 1,001 illnesses have been reported since the beginning of the year. Most are from outbreaks in New York in Orthodox Jewish communities.
The nation last saw this many cases in 1992, when more than 2,200 were reported.
Once common in the U.S., measles became rare after vaccination campaigns that started in the 1960s. A decade ago, there were fewer than 100 cases a year.
Overall vaccination rates have remained fairly high, but outbreaks have been happening in communities where parents have refused recommended shots for their children.

KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — Researchers in Uganda have launched the largest-ever trial of the experimental Ebola vaccine that is expected to be deployed in neighboring Congo, where a deadly outbreak has killed over 1,800 people.
The trial of the Janssen Pharmaceuticals vaccine involves up to 800 people in the western district of Mbarara and is supported by Doctors without Borders and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
Pontiano Kaleebu, a Ugandan researcher who leads the trial, said Friday that he regrets that the Janssen vaccine has not yet been deployed in Congo. The health minister there who stepped down last month had argued against its deployment, saying a second vaccine could create confusion on the ground.
Already more than 180,000 people in Congo's yearlong outbreak have received an experimental but effective Merck vaccine, but health experts worry about the availability of doses as the virus now spreads in a major city, Goma, along the Rwanda border. The wife and 1-year-old daughter of the man who died this week of Ebola in Goma now have the disease.
Both the wife and child were doing well in treatment, Congo's new Ebola response coordinator, Jean-Jacques Muyembe, told reporters on Friday.
But he warned that about half of the cases in this outbreak are going undetected and at that rate ""this epidemic could last two or three years."" The current goal is to strengthen surveillance and bring the detection rate to 80%, he said.
Health experts have watched with dismay as the promise of the Merck vaccine in this outbreak has been largely overshadowed by severe challenges to virus containment efforts including rebel attacks and community resistance in a part of Congo that had never experienced Ebola before.
The Janssen vaccine has already been tested in about 6,000 people, most of them Africans, Kaleebu said. ""We are excited about this (trial) ... because this is one of the promising vaccines,"" he said. ""It's one of those vaccines that have shown a lot of promise in animal studies but also in other trials that have been conducted.""
Ugandan researchers said the new trial is expected to last two years and will test how long any protection from Ebola would last. Juliet Mwanga, a co-investigator on the trial, said there is the need ""to study many vaccines"" in light of Congo's epidemic.
Uganda has had multiple Ebola outbreaks in the past. While it is currently free of the virus, three people died in June after crossing into the country's Kasese district on an unguarded footpath. Their family members were taken back to Congo for treatment.
The Ebola virus can spread quickly and be fatal in up to 90% of cases. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain and at times internal and external bleeding. The virus is most often spread by close contact with bodily fluids of people exhibiting symptoms and with contaminated objects such as sheets. Health care workers are often at risk.

PORTO ALEGRE, Brazil (AP) — Richarlison has been ruled out of Brazil's Copa America quarterfinal match against Paraguay because of mumps.
The Brazilian soccer confederation says the rest of the squad will be vaccinated after Thursday's game at the Arena do Gremio in Porto Alegre. It did not comment when asked by The Associated Press if there was any potential risk for Paraguayan players.
""Treatment requires absolute rest, medication and isolation from the group because of the risk of transmission,"" the soccer body said in a statement. ""Richarlison is in his room at the hotel, and receives dedicated attention from Brazil national team's medical department.""
The 22-year-old Richarlison was in coach Tite's starting XI in the team's opener but the striker lost his place to Everton in Brazil's 5-0 victory against Peru on Saturday. He has not scored any goals in the tournament.
Richarlison, who plays for English Premier League club Everton, trained with the rest of the team on Wednesday and was diagnosed with mumps following tests earlier Thursday.
The winner of the match in Porto Alegre faces either Argentina or Venezuela in the semifinals.
Mumps is contagious and spreads through coughing and sneezing. Most people recover within weeks.

ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Health officials in Florida say a worker at a Walt Disney World restaurant has been diagnosed with Hepatitis A, but no other colleagues or visitors have gotten sick.
Authorities said that the virus was confirmed last week in a food service worker at the Hoop-Dee-Doo musical revue at the resort's Fort Wilderness Campground.
The health department has been vaccinating co-workers this week and last week.
Disney World spokeswoman Erica Ettori said in an email the employee hasn't worked at the restaurant since being diagnosed and won't return until being cleared by the Department of Health.
The restaurant remains open. She says it has been thoroughly cleaned and sanitized in an abundance of caution.
The virus can cause liver disease and is spread from contact with things contaminated by stool.

SALT LAKE CITY — The recent report of a Utah dad who died while on a business trip in Ecuador after his family tried to have him flown back to the states for a heart procedure prompts questions of how to prepare for similar medical emergencies abroad.
""I think it's easy to think nothing's going to happen to me. But unfortunately, things do happen. I mean, we hear all the time about people breaking their ankles, or falling down and breaking their wrists. All kinds of things,"" said Holly Birich, manager of the Salt Lake County Health Department International Travel Clinic.
""All those things can happen here, too, but when you're in a country that doesn't have great medical care, it makes a big difference.""
Related:
She says while her office performs vaccinations and prescribes preventive medications for those visiting different countries, it also helps people feel safe and prepared for their trips.
First, Birich recommends always seeing a medical provider, like those at a travel clinic, before leaving the country. If someone has major health concerns, they should see their primary care provider, Birich said.
""We also want them to, if we know that they have certain issues or maybe they're not in the best physical shape, to be aware of their itinerary and not overexert themselves while they're on their vacation, because heart attacks are actually fairly common in travelers because they will often live a fairly sedentary lifestyle here,"" she said.
""But then they'll book these trips where it's just go, go, go, go, go — and their body just isn't physically ready for that. So we recommend that they make sure they're not scheduling themselves too much according to their current physical health.""
According to the nurse, something many people don't realize is that many other countries have different emergency phone numbers. Before going to a different country, find out what its version of 911 is.
Nurses at the travel clinic stay updated on which countries have good medical care, Birich said. If a country someone plans to visit doesn't have adequate care, the nurses can tell them where to find the ""closest best medical care"" to that country.
Earlier this month, after James Campbell, of Wellington in Carbon County, suffered an aortic dissection while on a business trip in South and Central America, his family was working to raise money to have him evacuated to Utah for a potentially life-saving procedure. That flight was expected to cost $46,000 up front, money the family was in the process of raising when he passed away in Ecuador.
Birich says travelers should have credit card amounts available to cover potential hospital stays, or special, short-term insurance that covers health care during international travel.
""A lot of times, in these other countries, you have to pay cash for your services before they'll ever even look at you,"" Birich explained.
Travel health insurance is like any other health insurance, but there are companies that specialize in it, Birich said. Policies depend on a person's health and what they plan to do on their trip.
""But usually it's not too expensive. So it's not like the trip cancellation insurance … it's usually less expensive than that. And sometimes you can actually buy them in combination at the same time,"" Birich explained.
She said costs range from between $60 to $250. Many travelers' medical insurance companies often help clients find medical care, and sometimes they'll even provide interpretation services, according to Birich.
""It isn't typically a huge expense, it's just, a lot of times when people are traveling, they're like, 'Oh, we got this cheap airfare, we got this great deal on this and that, and then they're like, 'Oh, now we have to pay for shots and now we have to pay for medication, and insurance now too. I mean, it all kind of adds up.""
Some plans also include medical evacuations, or flights back to the U.S. Evacuation insurance often takes care of flying bodies back to the country, she said.
""Anytime we see somebody, we recommend that they have medical and evacuation insurance, regardless of the length or whether it's work or pleasure.""
In cases of emergencies, travelers should always pack medications in their carry-on luggage, along with a list of those medications, allergies, medical history, blood type, and information about any recent surgeries or health-related incidents, the nurse said. They should also pack a first-aid kid.
Something many travelers aren't aware of, Birich said, is that they can and should register their trip with the State Department so if there is an emergency, the department can inform family members. If there's a political problem in the country, the U.S. Department of State can also tell family members where travelers are, Birich said.
Travelers can register their trips online with the State Department on its website.
""It's helpful. Hopefully most people don't need it, but if you do, it can be really beneficial,"" Birich said.
Of Utahns who die while traveling, ""we do hear about those stories more than you probably hear about in the news,"" according to the nurse.
""More often, we hear about people who are in these other countries and need medical care right away. And they can't get out of the country, so they get care there, but it's almost always subpar care.

NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon has removed books from its website that promoted ""cures"" for autism, the latest major company to try to limit the amount of misinformation related to autism and the bogus notion that it's caused by vaccines.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention says there is no cure for autism spectrum disorder, only medications that can help some function better. It also says there is no link between vaccines and autism.
An Amazon.com Inc. spokeswoman confirmed the books were no longer available, but did not answer any additional questions.
Last week, Facebook announced it would hide groups that spread misinformation about vaccines causing autism from search results. It also plans to reject similar ads.
The removal of the books from Amazon was first reported by NBC News.

NEW YORK (AP) — The degradation of relations between the U.S. and Cuba under President Donald Trump has begun to cut into scientific and medical cooperation on issues ranging from treatment of infectious diseases to coral reef preservation.
A biomedical fellowship exchange program has been put on hold. Cuban cardiac nurses have stopped providing training to universities in Georgia and Maryland. A Cuban marine researcher has stopped accepting invitations to events in the U.S. because it's nearly impossible to get visas.
The economic crackdown on Cuba does not specifically target science or academic and professional travel for U.S. citizens to the island, which is still allowed without having to ask for permission to the Department of Treasury. Scientists, however, say uncertainty around cooperation has already prompted fewer trips to Cuba and some projects have already been affected.
Three Cuban biomedical fellows who were selected in 2018 by the American Association for the Advancement of Science to study in the U.S. have been forced to remain in Cuba because of the difficulty to travel. The U.S Embassy in Havana took most of its staff out of Cuba after mysterious health incidents affected U.S. diplomats, forcing Cubans to travel to third countries to apply for a visa. Julia MacKenzie, senior director of International affairs for the AAAS, said that was too big an obstacle for the Cuban scientists.
The same problem affects the group Medical Education Cooperation With Cuba, a nonprofit known as Medicc based in Oakland, California, that promotes U.S.-Cuba health collaboration.
The group in the past has invited a group of Cuban eye doctors to Chicago, and four nurses from the William Soler children's heart center in Havana traveled to universities in Georgia and Maryland to exchange experiences about the care of children with congenital heart problems.
""We can no longer do that,"" said Gail Reed, Medicc's director of cooperation and executive editor of Medicc Review, which publishes research from Cuba and other developing countries.
Cuban officials said last week that more than 200 professors and researchers were denied visas to attend the annual conference of the Latin American Studies Association in Boston this month. Cuba said only 24 were allowed to travel to the conference, one of the hemisphere's largest academic meetings on Latin American affairs.
The association, in turn, said it would not meet in the United States for the foreseeable future, due partly to the difficulty that foreign academics have had in traveling to meetings in the U.S. It also blamed the Trump administration's hostile attitude toward immigrants.
The United States has enforced a trade embargo against Cuba since the early 1960s. However, U.S. President Barack Obama started a more open relationship with the island in 2014, leading to soaring numbers of American trips for cultural and educational exchanges.
The Trump administration has reversed course.
Washington recently announced a new cap on the amount of money that families in the U.S can send relatives in Cuba. The U.S. also has opened the way for lawsuits against foreign firms operating on properties that Cuba seized from Americans after the 1959 revolution, including suits by Cubans who later emigrated to the United States.
Reed said she is concerned Trump could reverse Obama's executive order that removed extra licensing requirements for Cuban medicines and biotech products going through the Food and Drug Administration approval process to reach U.S. patients. She is also concerned the new policies will discourage U.S. investors from joining ventures in Cuban biotechnology.
A spokesperson at the U.S. Department of State did not reply to requests for comment by The Associated Press.
Patricia González, director of the University of Havana's Center for Marine Research, said she used to travel often to the U.S. for meetings and to visit laboratories but now she declines the invitations she gets.
""The number of scientific visas that they (the U.S.) are giving is minimal. It is nothing compared to before, when it was really difficult to deny an academic visa,"" she said.
González also said some U.S. scientists are afraid of traveling to Cuba, worried about some sort of retaliation when they return to the U.S. Travel difficulties in both directions, she said, ""have really hurt the academic relationship.""
Taking care of species like sharks or endangered sawfish only makes sense if it is done regionally because they travel all around, Gonzalez said. The same regional approach needs to be taken for climate change or natural disasters, she added.
""What happens if there is an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico? How are we going to jointly face the problem? Because that is a threat that exists,"" she said.
Some projects, like a clinical trial in New York of a vaccine for lung cancer patients developed in Cuba, are moving forward.
And some scientists try to be optimistic.
""We have been able to ride the waves of political relations and we hope to be able to continue to do that,"" said Dan Whittle, senior director with the New York-based Environmental Defense Fund, which has worked with Cuban universities, research centers and the Cuban government for 19 years on marine and coastal conservation.
""Science and the environment transcend politics,"" Whittle said.

NEW YORK (AP) — The flu vaccine is doing a relatively good job this season, protecting about half the people who got it, U.S. health officials said Thursday.
Preliminary figures suggest the vaccine is 47 percent effective in preventing flu illness severe enough to send someone to the doctor's office. Health officials are generally pleased if a flu vaccine works in 40 to 60 percent of people.
""These are early estimates, but they are encouraging,"" said Dr. Alicia Fry of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Somewhere between 10,000 and 16,000 people have died from flu and its complications so far this season, according to new estimates released Thursday.
Last winter was dominated by a nasty kind of flu, and the vaccine's weakness against it was one reason it was the deadliest flu season in at least four decades. An estimated 80,000 Americans died of flu and its complications.
This winter, in most parts of the country, most illnesses are being caused by a somewhat milder virus that vaccines tend to perform better against.
Overall, flu is widespread in 47 states, according to the most recent CDC data. Health officials don't know if flu season has peaked yet, Fry said.
They also are seeing evidence that a more severe flu virus is spreading to more states.
It's unusual to see a later surge of nastier illnesses in a season initially dominated by a milder flu bug, and it's not clear why that's happening, said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University infectious diseases expert.
Related story:
The early estimates on the vaccine's potency offer only a fuzzy picture. For example, there weren't enough sick patients of different ages to produce a reliable estimate of how it did in the elderly, who are at greater risk from flu and its complications.
Some other types of vaccines — like the one against measles, mumps and rubella — are far more effective in preventing people from getting sick than the flu vaccine. But experts say flu is a quick-changing and elusive target.
A flu vaccine that works around half the time ""is the best that science can produce at the current time,"" Schaffner said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Roughly one in every six times someone is taken to an emergency room or checks in to the hospital, the treatment is followed by a ""surprise"" medical bill, according to a study released Thursday. And depending on where you live, the odds can be much higher.
The report from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation finds that millions of people with what's considered solid coverage from large employers are nonetheless exposed to ""out-of-network"" charges that can amount to thousands of dollars. It comes as congressional lawmakers of both parties and the Trump administration move to close the loophole, with a Senate panel scheduled to vote on legislation next week.
A patient's odds of getting a surprise bill vary greatly depending on the state he or she lives in. Texas seems like a bit of a gamble, with 27% of emergency room visits and 38% of in-network hospital stays triggering at least one such bill. Minnesota looks safer, with odds of 2% and 3%, respectively.
Researcher Karen Pollitz of the Kaiser Foundation said the reasons for such wide differences are not entirely clear, but seem to be related to the breadth of hospital and doctor networks in each state, and the ways those networks are designed.
Patients in New York, Florida, New Jersey and Kansas were also more likely to get surprise bills. Among the other states where it was less likely were South Dakota, Nebraska, Maine and Mississippi.
Averaging the results nationwide, 18 percent of emergency room visits and 16 percent of stays at an in-network hospital triggered a surprise bill for patients with health insurance through a large employer, the study estimated.
That illustrates the need for Congress to get involved, said Pollitz, since large-employer plans are regulated by federal law and surprise billing protections already enacted by states like New York do not apply to them. ""This is a prominent problem affecting patients, and it is beyond the reach of state laws to fix, and it is by definition beyond the ability of patients to fix on their own,"" she said.
JUST RELEASED: In large employer plans, 18% of all emergency visits and 16% of all in-network hospital stays had an out-of-network charge – likely leading to a “surprise medical bill” -- in 2017.
— Kaiser Family Foundation (@KaiserFamFound) June 20, 2019
The likelihood varied dramatically by state. https://t.co/KtsDR8GdSlpic.twitter.com/4y06duAjlJ
Next Wednesday, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee plans to vote on bipartisan legislation that would limit what patients can be charged to their in-network deductibles and copays. The bill from Sens. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Patty Murray, D-Wash., would require insurers to pay out-of-network doctors and hospitals the median — or midpoint — rate paid to in-network providers. The House Energy and Commerce committee is working on similar legislation. President Donald Trump has said he wants to sign a bill.
Major industry lobbies are going to battle over the issue. Insurers and employers generally favor the approach the Alexander-Murray bill takes on how to pay out-of-network providers, using an in-network rate as the reference point. But hospitals and doctors instead want disputed bills to go to arbitration. New York has an arbitration system and a recent study found it has worked well. However, some lawmakers are concerned that on a national scale it may lead to a costly new bureaucracy.
Surprise bills can come about in different ways. In an emergency, a patient can wind up at a hospital that's not in their insurer's network. Even at an in-network hospital, emergency physicians or anesthesiologists may not have a contract with the patient's insurer. For a scheduled surgery at an in-network hospital, not all the doctors may be in the patients' plan.
Bills can amount to tens of thousands of dollars and hit patients and their families when they are most vulnerable. Often patients are able to negotiate lower charges by working with their insurers and the medical provider. But the process usually takes months, adding stress and anxiety. When it doesn't work out bills can get sent to collection agencies.
The Kaiser estimates are based on insurance claims from 2017 for nearly 19 million people, or more than 1 in 5 of those covered by large employers. The claims details came from an IBM Health Analytics database that contains information provided by large-employer plans. Researchers excluded patients 65 or older, most of whom are covered by Medicare.
The Alexander-Murray legislation also includes other ideas aimed at lowering medical costs by promoting competition to brand-name drugs, blocking health industry contracting practices can bid up prices, and requiring greater disclosure of information. A public health section of the bill would authorize a national campaign to increase awareness of the role vaccines play in preventing disease.

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Some fans attending Sunday's Indianapolis 500 can get measles vaccines at the track's infield medical center.
IndyCar medical director Geoffrey Billows said Thursday a ""very limited supply"" of vaccines will be available at the medical building near the Indianapolis Motor Speedway museum. He says most insurance companies will cover the cost.
Billows encourages concerned fans to get vaccinated before coming to a race expected to attract in excess of 275,000.
Measles was once common in the U.S. but gradually became rare after vaccination campaigns that started in the 1960s. The nation is struggling with a high number of cases this year as some families choose not to get vaccinated despite the recommendations of public health experts.
At least 20 confirmed cases of mumps also were reported at Indiana University in Bloomington, about 50 miles southwest of Indianapolis.

WASHINGTON (CNN) — The aches, the sneezing, the sore throat, the exhaustion — flu season is here and you want to be prepared.
Typically, the ""season"" starts in October, but there has already been flu-related deaths reported. Physicians say it's not too early to get a flu shot and they are available at many pharmacies and doctor's offices around the country.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people get a flu vaccine by the end of October, if possible. Doctors say you definitely want to one before Thanksgiving, when you are likely to see more people, travel and be exposed to more germs. It typically takes about two weeks to build up your immunity once you get the shot.
Last year's flu season
For the 2018-2019 US flu season, which started October 1, 2018, and ended May 4, preliminary numbers from the CDC estimate there were nearly 42.9 million cases of flu, up to 647,000 hospitalizations and up to 61,200 flu deaths.
It wasn't a typical flu season, experts said. The severity was moderate, the CDC reported, but it was record-breaker as the longest flu season in a decade.
""Last year was funny in a way,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, National Foundation for Infectious Diseases medical director and professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. ""We had an unprecedented event with one virus dominating the season early on, then it abated, then another strain came along, making this a double-barrel season that we hadn't seen before and also making it rather prolonged.""
Predicting the flu this year
For this year, the ""crystal ball is very cloudy,"" about how bad it will be, but flu season is ""not good for anyone,"" Schaffner said — especially for the very young, pregnant women, the elderly and people with chronic conditions. All are vulnerable to the worst effects of the flu.
""One sure thing about influenza is, where and how it will spread or what kind of season we will have, it is unpredictable,"" said Dr. Daniel B. Jernigan, the director of the influenza division at the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, a division of the CDC. ""The more we know, the more we know you can't figure it out very well.""
Jernigan said the CDC has increased the number of viruses it tests for and it works with scientists from all around the world to track them. Using sophisticated artificial intelligence and modeling they can characterize where the virus is going and what kind of virus it will be to some extent. But it's not easy, since the virus changes every year as it moves through the population.
The virus also can change within a season as it moves from country to country. Looking at how bad a flu season was in Australia, which has winter when the United States has its summer, is not necessarily predictive of what the flu season will be like in the US, Jernigan said.
""This virus continues to be elusive,"" Jernigan said.""While we don't have a clear idea, we do know flu is going to be here and the best way to prevent it is to get a vaccine.""
""We get on our soapbox and remind people that everyone older than 6 months needs to be vaccinated every year,"" said Schaffner.
Get your flu vaccine
It's not a perfect vaccine because there are a number of flu strains that circulate, but it does provide some protection. If you happen to get sick, the vaccine cuts down on how long your symptoms last and it should protect you from the major complications that come with the flu, such as pneumonia.
""What the vaccine does is shift the equation in our favor,"" said Schaffner.
This year, nasal spray is an option for some patients, including children who may not like getting a shot. In some years, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended children stick with a shot, as some studies showed it was more effective. There is no such suggestion this year.
The time get the shot is now
Schaffner adds that if you have a chronic disease such as diabetes or asthma or heart disease, the flu shot should be a part of your regular care. In that case, you are the kind of patient that the flu makes very sick and you are at highest risk for hospitalization and death. The flu can also put you more at risk to have a heart attack or a stroke.
With some older people, doctors might recommend they get the vaccine in the middle or end of October, because their immunity could wane toward the end of the season. But Dr. David Cennimo, an infectious disease specialist and assistant professor in the department of medicine at Rutgers University, said he usually tells his patients to get it whenever they can.
""If they are really concerned about the potential for the vaccine to wane over six months, they may want to wait a few weeks but you really don't want to go beyond middle October or the end of October, because of the risk of exposure to flu in your area,"" said Cennimo.
What else can you do to avoid the flu?
There are ways to avoid the flu.
Repeatedly washing your hands can help protect you this flu season. Flu germs tend to linger and hand washing can cut down our exposure.
Avoid friends and family members that are sick.
And for the sake of those around you, stay home from work or school if you are sick. Rest will help you get better and staying home can protect people around you.

OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) — Washington state lawmakers voted Tuesday to remove parents' ability to claim a personal or philosophical exemption from vaccinating their children for measles, although medical and religious exemptions will remain.
The vote comes as the number of measles cases nationwide this year has passed 600.
The measure now heads to Gov. Jay Inslee, who has expressed support for limiting exemptions. The state has seen 74 cases of measles this year. Most of those cases were centered in one county and involved children 10 or younger who were not immunized.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that as of the end of last week, 626 cases of measles have been confirmed in the U.S. so far this year, up from 555 as of a week ago. While 22 states have reported cases, most of the nation's cases are centered in New York City and in nearby Rockland County north of the city.
Democratic state Rep. Monica Stonier of Vancouver said the measure will ""reduce the risk that our communities face when an outbreak is possible.""
""It keeps kids in school,"" she said. ""It keeps people with compromised immunities safe in their communities.""
Washington is among 17 states that allow some type of non-medical vaccine exemption for personal or philosophical beliefs. In addition, medical and religious exemptions exist for attendance at the state's public or private schools or licensed day-care centers. Medical and religious exemptions remain in place under the measure.
Unless an exemption is claimed, children are required to be vaccinated against or show proof of acquired immunity for nearly a dozen diseases — including polio, whooping cough and measles — before they can attend school or go to child care centers.
The state Department of Health said that 4% of Washington K-12 students have non-medical vaccine exemptions. Of those, 3.7% of the exemptions are personal, and the rest are religious.
While the Senate had first sought a bill that would have removed the philosophical exemption for all required childhood vaccines, both chambers ultimately agreed to move forward with the House bill that focused only on the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine — also known as MMR.
Republican Rep. Joe Schmick said the measure was ""the wrong direction that we should be moving.""
""The parents should be making this call, and they should be the one to decide,"" he said.

BEIJING (AP) — Thirty years since the Tiananmen Square protests, China's economy has catapulted up the world rankings, yet political repression in the country is harsher than many who watched those events would have anticipated.
Hundreds of thousands of Muslims are held in re-education camps without charge, student activists face relentless harassment, and dissident leaders have been locked up or simply vanished.
Religious groups face ever greater pressure to conform, and a web of mass surveillance is bolstering a system many call totalitarian. It's a far cry from the hopes of the idealistic student demonstrators, and a level of control far beyond what many imagined possible, even after the army's bloody crushing of the protests on the night of June 3-4, 1989.
Critics say the Tiananmen crackdown, which left hundreds, possibly thousands, dead, set the ruling Communist Party on its present course of ruthless suppression, summary incarceration and the frequent use of violence against opponents in the name of ""stability maintenance.""
""The June 4 incident changed the direction of Chinese history,"" said Zhang Lifan, who in 1989 was a scholar at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ""The narrative that China would grow strong and normal, become a stable country through a process of political reform, was destroyed.""
Chinese officials routinely respond to questions about the suppression by pointing to the economic progress China has made. In the three decades since the protests, China has risen to become the world's second-largest economy and is forging ahead in areas from high-speed rail to artificial intelligence and 5G mobile communications.
China's navy now sails around the globe, its space program has launched half a dozen crewed missions and its sprawling cross-border infrastructure projects are extending its influence from Nairobi to the Netherlands.
Politically, however, the state has never been more repressive. Restrictions on freedom of speech have been extended from publishing into social media, and the slightest act of perceived defiance can prompt a near instantaneous response from the authorities. The sprawling domestic security apparatus operates with impunity, coerced confessions are broadcast on state television and prison sentences are handed out on the flimsiest of charges, including ""picking quarrels"" and ""incitement to subversion.""
Calls for even moderate reforms have been attacked or just ignored. An attempt to introduce grass-roots democracy at the village level years ago foundered after the Communist Party refused to concede even a modicum of control. Deliberative bodies at all levels are filled with party appointees who vote how they're told, and the national legislature is a mere rubber stamp body, re-electing president and party head Xi Jinping last year by a margin of 2,970 to 0.
Regarded as China's most powerful leader in a generation, Xi took the opportunity to amend the constitution and remove presidential term limits, making him president-for-life if he so chooses. While the party is believed to be rife with power struggles, Xi's ongoing anti-corruption campaign and the threat of heavy prison sentences keep his opponents in check.
In the wake of the Tiananmen crackdown, efforts to supervise the party's workings and control corruption through the media and public oversight were lost, Zhang said. While it ushered in the era of new party leader Jiang Zemin under which the economy grew, graft also became endemic, faith in communism was exhausted and interpersonal relationships revolved around sheer personal gain, essentially finishing off what the violent, radical Cultural Revolution had begun almost 20 years earlier, he said.
""The moment the government ordered its army to fire on its own people, it lost its legitimacy,"" said Rowena Xiaoqing He, a former protester who created a course on Tiananmen at Harvard and is a current member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.
""Of course, those in power can easily manipulate history and twist our memory. But that kind of manipulation and suppression of history is always followed by distortions of all kinds — social, political, psychological,"" He said. ""It is indeed impossible to understand today's China without understanding the spring of 1989.""
Speaking at a regional defense forum in Singapore on Sunday, Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe defended the government's response to the protests, drawing the stock link to China's post-1989 development.
""How can we say that China didn't handle that Tiananmen incident appropriately? There is a conclusion of that incident, that incident was political turbulence and the central government took measures to stop the turbulence, which is a correct policy,"" Feng said.
An editorial Monday in the official Communist Party newspaper Global Times' English edition said the 1989 ""riot"" had ""immunized China against turmoil"" and blamed veteran student leaders and foreign politicians of using the anniversary to attack China. The editorial made no mention of the military crackdown or subsequent repression.
Given that unbending official line, hopes for a re-evaluation of the crushing of the 1989 protests seem incredibly distant, despite the lack of any direct personal connection to that decision among the current ranks of leaders. Revisiting the episode, meanwhile, could undermine party prestige and authority among a younger generation who know only relative prosperity and little or nothing of the events of 1989.
While China has sought to rally the public with appeals to patriotism and the ideals of the communist revolution that swept the Communist Party to power in 1949, their belief system seems hollow at the core.
In an ironic twist, the Communist Party seems truly disconcerted by young people who remain true believers in Marxism for China.
A harsh crackdown on members of the Marxist student society at prestigious Peking University is one of the most extreme examples of the regime's insecurity and willingness to trample basic human rights. The school, whose Communist Party secretary — its top leader — was recently replaced by a former head of the national spy agency's branch in Beijing, has stood by as security agents have beaten, harassed and forcibly removed students who joined in the club's activities, including seeking solidarity with workers by joining them on the assembly line.
""I think the government has been very concerned about another round of student activists staging mass demonstrations. That's why they are being so nervous about students getting involved in protest,"" said Patrick Poon, China researcher for Amnesty International in Hong Kong.
China's domestic security spending now outstrips its defense budget, constituting an ever-growing strain on finances as the economy slows — from double digits to just 6.6% last year, a three-decade low. In addition, 20% of the defense budget is spent on the People's Armed Police, the internal security force.
Yet more initiatives are in the works, in particular the ""social credit"" system of mass data collection that monitors every citizen's digital, economic and social behavior and can limit access to everything from job offers to train tickets. Still, China ranks far down in global rankings for political stability and absence of violence, below countries such as Sri Lanka, Greece and Moldova in 2017. Numbers of protests listed as ""mass incidents"" run into the tens of thousands each year.
With the party having shut off all channels for organized opposition or even calls for inner-party reform, Zhang, the scholar, says he sees only two scenarios under which China might be able to ""overturn the verdict"" on Tiananmen. One would be during a time of supreme economic and political confidence, offering a chance to ""pay off this historical debt,"" he said. The other would be in the case of an existential crisis, when the regime was ""grasping at straws.""
The opportunity for the first option has already passed because of constant infighting for political influence and the economy on decline, partly because of the trade war with the U.S., Zhang said. The second scenario ""has yet to come to pass.""
Despite the setback it dealt to Chinese political reform, the crackdown may have had a salutary effect on events elsewhere, hurrying the peaceful fall of the Berlin Wall the same year and the dissolution of the Soviet Union soon after, Zhang said.
""So even though the Chinese people didn't benefit from it, the rest of the world felt the impact,"" he said.

BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Health officials in southwestern Idaho are warning medical care providers to be on the lookout for symptoms of measles because of an outbreak in western Washington that has sickened at least 26 people.
Officials with Southwest District Health in Caldwell, Idaho say so far no measles cases have been reported in Idaho as a result of the outbreak. However, some of the people infected with the virus have visited public places like the Portland International Airport, and Washington Department of Health epidemiologist Dr. Scott Lindquist says the outbreak is expected to move across the state.
Southwest District Health says health care providers should consider measles if they see patients with symptoms like fever and malaise followed by a rash that starts at the head and moves down the body.
Measles is highly contagious and can be spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can remain in the air for up to two hours.
Measles can lead to serious complications including pneumonia but the vaccine is up to 97 percent effective and protects recipients for life.

ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — New York eliminated the religious exemption to vaccine requirements for schoolchildren Thursday, as the nation's worst measles outbreak in decades prompts states to reconsider giving parents ways to opt out of immunization rules.
The Democrat-led Senate and Assembly voted Thursday to repeal the exemption, which allows parents to cite religious beliefs to forego getting their child the vaccines required for school enrollment.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, signed the measure minutes after the final vote. The law takes effect immediately but will give unvaccinated students up to 30 days after they enter a school to show they've had the first dose of each required immunization.
With New York's move, similar exemptions are still allowed in 45 states, though lawmakers in several of them have introduced their own legislation to eliminate the waiver.
The issue is hotly contested and debate around it has often been emotional, pitting cries that religious freedom is being curtailed against warnings that public health is being endangered. After the vote in the Assembly, many of those watching from the gallery erupted in cries of ""shame!"" One woman yelled obscenities down to the lawmakers below.
The debate has only intensified with this year's measles outbreak , which federal officials recently said has surpassed 1,000 illnesses, the highest in 27 years.
""I'm not aware of anything in the Torah, the Bible, the Koran or anything else that suggests you should not get vaccinated,"" said Bronx Democrat Jeffrey Dinowitz, the bill's Assembly sponsor. ""If you choose to not vaccinate your child, therefore potentially endangering other children ... then you're the one choosing not to send your children to school.""
Hundreds of parents of unvaccinated children gathered at New York's Capitol for the vote to protest.
Stan Yung, a Long Island attorney and father, said his Russian Orthodox religious views and health concerns about vaccines will prevent him from vaccinating his three young children. His family, he said, may consider leaving the state.
""People came to this country to get away from exactly this kind of stuff,"" Yung said ahead of Thursday's votes.
Supporters of the bill say religious beliefs about vaccines shouldn't eclipse scientific evidence that they work, noting the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1905 that states have the right to enforce compulsory vaccination laws. During the Assembly's floor debate, supporters brought up scourges of the past that were defeated in the U.S. through vaccines.
""I'm old enough to have been around when polio was a real threat,"" said Assemblywoman Deborah Glick, D-Manhattan. ""I believe in science.... Your personal opinions, which may be based on junk science, do not trump the greater good.""
Supporters also suggest some parents may be claiming the religious exemption for their children even though their opposition is actually based on scientifically discredited claims about the dangers of vaccines.
The bill would not change an existing state exemption given to children who cannot have vaccines for medical reasons, such as a weakened immune system.
Cuomo told reporters on Wednesday that he believes public health — and the need to protect those who cannot get vaccinated because for medical reasons — outweighs the concerns about religious freedom.
""I understand freedom of religion,"" he said. ""I have heard the anti-vaxxers' theory, but I believe both are overwhelmed by the public health risk.""
The current measles outbreak has renewed concern about the exemptions in many states. The nation last saw as many cases in 1992, when more than 2,200 were reported.
The majority of cases are from outbreaks in New York in Orthodox Jewish communities.
California removed personal belief vaccine exemptions for children in both public and private schools in 2015, after a measles outbreak at Disneyland sickened 147 people and spread across the U.S. and into Canada. Maine ended its religious exemption earlier this year.
Mississippi and West Virginia also do not allow religious exemptions.
Once common in the U.S., measles became rare after vaccination campaigns that started in the 1960s. A decade ago, there were fewer than 100 cases a year.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California police have arrested a woman who threw a feminine hygiene device containing ""what appeared to be blood"" onto the floor of the state Senate, splashing onto lawmakers and forcing them to finish their work in a committee room on the final day of the legislative session.
Senators had just finished taking a vote about 5:14 p.m. Friday when a woman tossed the substance onto the floor of the Senate from the public gallery, saying: ""That's for the dead babies.""
The California Highway Patrol identified the woman as 43-year-old Rebecca Dalelio. She faces several charges, including assault, vandalism and disrupting ""the orderly conduct of official business"" at the state Capitol.
Police say Dalelio walked out of the gallery and did not resist when she was arrested. The news release did not give a motive, referring to the woman as a ""demonstrator."" But the action came as hundreds of people protested at the Capitol against a recently signed state law seeking to crack down on fraudulent medical exemptions for vaccinations.
The Sacramento Bee reports that Dalelio posted $10,000 bail and was released from the Sacramento County Main Jail on Saturday, according to sheriff's department records.
Several lawmakers sought to link the woman to the protesters, including Sen. Richard Pan, who last month was shoved in the back by a protester as he was walking near the Capitol.
""This incident was incited by the violent rhetoric perpetuated by leaders of the antivaxx movement,"" Pan said in a news release. ""As their rhetoric escalates, their incidents of violence does as well. This is an attack on the democratic process and it must be met with strong condemnation by everyone.""
The drama unfolded on the final day of the Legislative session, with lawmakers still having several key bills to debate before adjourning for the year. With authorities still investigating what the substance was, Senate leadership decided lawmakers would finish their work in a smaller committee room. Legislative aides scrambled to move the Senate's work to the room as journalists and others watched from an upstairs balcony.
""A crime was committed today, but the Senate will not be deterred from completing the Senate's business,"" Senate President Pro Tempore Toni Atkins told lawmakers as the Senate reconvened.
Many Republicans had opposed the vaccine bill. But on Friday, Senate Republican Leader Shannon Grove condemned the act and apologized to her colleagues for the disruption.
""The person that is in question should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" Grove said.
Democratic Sen. Steve Glazer said the liquid landed on his head. He also said five other senators were struck by the liquid.
""I'm going to take a shower,"" Glazer told reporters crowded in the hallway outside the Senate chambers. ""We have work to do.""

Walking in a winter wonderland sounds romantic, not to mention beautiful, but the fun ends quickly if you slip on some ice and break your tailbone. Winter can be the most wonderful time of the year as long as you take special steps to stay safe.
Here are common winter medical issues that send Utahns to a nearby emergency room, along with tips to help avoid these problems yourself.
Falls
A simple fall might not seem like a big deal to some, but things drastically change as people age. Where a simple slip on the ice outside one’s home might be cause for annoyance, those over the age of 65 need to be extra aware of the dangers that come with falling.
According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 30 percent of people over the age of 65 fall at least once a year, often with a resulting visit to the emergency room. Such falls can even be fatal, as existing and new data reinforces that falls are the leading cause of fatal and non-fatal injuries in those over 65.
Bone density lessens with age, along with a higher likelihood of secondary complications from the fall. Coordination also may be diminished, so there’s plenty of reason for caution to avoid common mishaps.
To avoid a painful and devastating fall, be sure to enlist help keeping the areas around your home well-shoveled and treated with ice melt. Wear shoes with high grip ability, and choose where you walk with care. As always, it never hurts to ask for a helping hand if you’re worried about falling on the treacherous winter walks.
Influenza
The flu is all too common a reason for a visit to the ER during the winter months, and specific populations are at risk. While no one enjoys having the flu, it can be particularly dangerous to the elderly, young children and pregnant women or those with compromised immune health, says Healthline.com.
Although you can read a weekly update from the CDC on flu outbreaks and vaccine success, medical professionals agree that getting a flu shot and washing your hands are the two best ways to stay healthy. In addition to taking these precautions, stay home if you’re sick, get plenty of sleep and eat a healthy diet to bolster your immune system.
Other respiratory illnesses
Due to poor air quality that often occurs in Utah’s most populated areas, many people suffer from serious respiratory illnesses. Annual data released from the Utah Department of Health suggests that emergency room visits for conditions like asthma, bronchitis and pneumonia may be increasing: nearly 6,000 ER admissions each for bronchitis and asthma, along with nearly 16,000 more admissions for respiratory issues in 2017.
Whether that increase is a result of worsening air quality may yet be unclear, but those vulnerable should do their best to avoid exposure during periods of bad air quality. Before planning a winter outing, check the air quality in your area via air.utah.gov. Carpool whenever possible to cut down on added pollutants, and talk to your local government leaders about ways to provide clean air to all Utah residents.
Recreation accidents
For cities like Park City and Salt Lake City, winter is peak tourist season due to the variety of winter recreation activities available. Whether you like to snowboard or ski, ice skate or play hockey, there’s plenty to do during the colder months. With so much fun to have, just be sure you take the necessary precautions before you go riding in a one-horse open sleigh.
Although chances of you dying in a skiing/snowboarding accident are extremely low, as low as a 1 in a million chance, says the National Ski Areas Association, chances of you becoming injured are not. Broken bones, torn tendons, and sore muscles are not uncommon for adventuresome skiers or snowboarders, so it’s important to do what you can to stay safe.
One research analysis cites head injuries as the most common and serious injury occurring to those on the slopes (eight out of nine fatalities), so be sure to wear a helmet. Tackle hills and trails on your skill level, learn how to fall safely, and don’t recreate in restricted areas. If you’re a novice, it’s also a good idea to go with an experienced teacher to show you the ropes.
Intestinal viruses and food-borne illness
The food and family get-togethers during the holiday season is actually a perfect opportunity for infectious gastrointestinal diseases and food-borne illnesses to spread. Utah Department of Health records lists more than 24,000 ER visits for gastroenteritis last year alone. Holiday spreads and buffets are difficult to keep when someone new is always joining the party.
People are also gathering together indoors more than the other seasons, so exchanging germs happens at a much higher rate. Keep foods refrigerated and avoid snacking on neglected food items. Wash your hands and keep your kids home if they are sick. If you’re feeling under the weather, pass on the next holiday get-together until you feel at your best again.
These simple suggestions can keep you healthier this winter, but no one is completely immune. Do your best to stay safe and avoid a trip to the emergency room, but if you end up going anyway, make sure you choose a hospital with a high level of care and expertise.

SALT LAKE CITY — Hundreds of families gathered in Salt Lake City Friday for the state's largest free health care clinic.
The medical help ""means a lot,"" said LaTiffani Johnson, who visited the clinic with her young daughter. ""It's very helpful when you don't have much.""
The Horizonte Instruction and Training Center bustled with community members and volunteers speaking an array of languages. Attendees received free child care, health screenings, dental care, women's services and immunizations. Volunteers also passed out free bicycle helmets to kids and car seats to their parents.
The clinic will also be open Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Ahead of anticipated Immigrations and Custom Enforcement raids, Gov. Gary Herbert and Salt Lake Police Chief Mike Brown in April have declared the clinic a safe place for all community members.
""There's definitely been a fear, just with our current political climate, of people being afraid of raids or if their status is going to be made public by going to this event. However, it has been declared a safe place. We want anyone to come, whether you're an immigrant or refugee, despite if you're maybe an illegal immigrant or if you're not,"" said Erin Jelmini, a Junior League spokeswoman at the clinic.
""That information is not going to be given here at all, so you don't have to give ID or insurance, so there's no fear of letting that get out into the community.""
That is why the organization had the clinic declared ""safe,"" she said.
Johnson said she benefited from ""basically everything"" at the event.
""I went over there about child care for her, and then we had a physical, we both did, and then we had a medical exam. I got my blood pressure and everything checked, and my cholesterol. It's been good and helpful to know where my body is,"" she said.
About 17 language interpreters helped people communicate at the event, according to volunteer Jennifer Kelsey. The yearly clinic usually serves about 3,000 people.
Many at the event said getting new car seats for their kids filled a true need.
""The car seat's just really helpful because for me, I can't afford one. And I know he has outgrown his. And they're able to provide that,"" April Lucas said of her son.
""It was nice. They had a lot of activities. They engaged with my kids, too, and they had that free day care,"" Lucas said.
But she said the most impactful part of the event was the people there offering all kinds of help. ""They were really friendly. They were, like, come over here. We have this for you and your child.""
For volunteer and interpreter Axel Sanchez, who helped pass out bicycle helmets, the ""community"" feeling of the event is what made it special.
""Just everyone that's here, it's all volunteers. … Everyone that's here is just like passionate and motivated. They want to help people. And the people that come here are people that probably wouldn't go seek out any kind of medical attention,"" Sanchez explained.
Several community organizations participated in the event, which was held by the Junior League of Salt Lake City. The budget for the event was about $250,000 for the weekend, organizers said. Last year, about 800 volunteers helped out and this year's numbers were expected to be similar.
Without fail, as each child received a new helmet, they had big smiles and told the volunteers about their love for riding bikes.
Rita Mosquera, who went to the event for her second year, said through a translator that it was ""a really great experience.""
""It means a lot because I don't have the money to pay for medical services, and they give you everything here,"" she said. ""It's just a lot of help, and I'm really grateful.""
Daniel Lee, who was there with his wife and little girl, said, ""We got the helmet for the little kids, and also we are waiting for a turn to get a car seat.""
""Yeah, she really likes"" the helmet, Lee said of his daughter. ""It really helps, especially for the kids. Because we need to make sure she gets the safety equipment, and so on, so she can go around safely. We really appreciate the things that they are doing.""
Brittany Ward said she and her kids go to the event every year. She agreed with others that the car seat makes the biggest difference.
""It's really helpful with the car seat program for them. And then knowing their weight and their height, so that's the most important to me,"" she said after her two boys performed activities with blocks to see if they qualify for help from DDI Vantage, which provides early intervention and Head Start programs for children and families.
""This is a great time for our families who may not be able to qualify or have the money to see a medical need like hearing or vision, so they're able to come here and have the service for free,"" said Raquel Webster, a facilitator with DDI Advantage.",2019-07-12T00:00:00Z,2019,3,16

MIAMI (AP) — The Trump administration on Monday reassured governors that they will be reimbursed for at least some of the costs of responding to the spread of the coronavirus, as several states began setting aside millions of dollars to head off a public health crisis.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Vice President Mike Pence addressed state needs for equipment and funding to fight the spread of the coronavirus during a call with governors. He told them the administration would find the money to reimburse them.
“What the vice president is envisioning as a former governor is ‘Look, you guys need to be able to combat this thing. So you guys do what you’ve got to do. We will appropriate money and then simply reimburse you on the back end,’” DeSantis, a Republican, said at a news conference in Miami after confirming two people had been tested positive in Florida.
Coronavirus cases have topped 100 in the U.S. and have spread to nearly a dozen states. Of those, six cases have been fatal, all in Washington state.
In Congress, bipartisan negotiations are nearly complete on $7 billion to $8 billion in emergency funding to battle the virus, according to both Democratic and GOP aides. The measure appears on track to be unveiled as early as Tuesday, and the hope is to speed it quickly through both House and Senate by the end of the week.
The measure would finance both federal and state response efforts, fund the federal government’s drive to develop and produce a vaccine, and offer Small Business Administration disaster loans to help businesses affected by coronavirus concerns.
U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, said he hopes Congress will pass the measure within the next 10 days.
“We are going to fight for the money that is necessary to be effective and stop this disease from becoming a pandemic,” he said.
State officials say they need the money for a wide array of expenses, including protective gear, housing and transporting those under quarantine, overtime for medical workers performing lab tests and public information campaigns.
Health officials in Washington state say they have already spent $3.5 million in response. The state’s Secretary of Health John Wiesman asked state lawmakers Monday for an additional $100 million for the budget year that ends in July 2021 so that the state’s public health system can adequately respond to the number of cases of coronavirus in the state.
“We want to mount a response that is the right response for Washington and one where I’m not worried about ‘Do I have the money to actually mount the response we need,’” Wiesman told state lawmakers.
Meanwhile, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he will ask lawmakers to approve $40 million to respond to the threat, including hiring additional health care workers and buying supplies. Cuomo said he wants to ensure the state’s public health laboratory could handle up to 1,000 cases of coronavirus a day. The state Assembly was scheduled to consider the request Monday night.
In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom said he will ask the Legislature to allocate up to $20 million toward the virus response. The state had 43 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of Monday, more than half of which were related to federal repatriation flights.
Hawaii Gov. David Ige has requested $10.5 million from the Legislature to pay for coronavirus response efforts over the next four months. In Alaska, Gov. Mike Dunleavy is asking lawmakers to provide more than $4 million as part of the state’s efforts to prepare for the virus. His budget request also would include allowing the state to receive up to $9 million in federal money.
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican who chairs the National Governors Association and was present for Monday's call, is submitting a $10 million supplemental budget to the Maryland Legislature.
“They’re doing a similar thing at the federal level, but they did address that they realize that they’re going to be having to reimburse states for some of the expenses that we incur,” Hogan said. “Nobody knows at this point exactly what those expenses are going to be. It’s just in anticipation of the potential that the crisis could escalate and get much worse.”
The governors said Pence, who Trump tapped to lead the U.S. response, also assured them they would have access to appropriate medical supplies such as masks, gowns and respirators if needed.

NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks dropped nearly 10% at the opening of trading Monday on Wall Street, triggering an automatic 15-minute halt, as huge swaths of the economy come closer to shutting down, from airlines to restaurants. Emergency actions taken by the Federal Reserve late Sunday to prop up the economy and get financial markets running smoothly again may have raised fears even further, some investors said. The Fed on Sunday cut its key interest rate to near zero. European markets were also down about 10%. The price of crude oil also dropped about 10% . Bond prices soared as investors sought safety.
WASHINGTON (AP) — White House officials are greeting staff members, reporters and camera workers by swiping their foreheads with a temporal thermometer. It's part of new measures put in place Monday to protect President Donald Trump and his staff during the coronavirus outbreak. Only those with a reading of 99.6 degrees Fahrenheit or less are being allowed entry into the complex. The new measures expand on screenings the White House began on Saturday for anyone who will get close to Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. Members of the press corps are also taking steps, independent of the White House, to limit their own exposure to the coronavirus.
UNDATED (AP) — Millions of people are holed up at home or keeping a wary eye on how close they get to friends and neighbors as fear of the new coronavirus spreads to more places. The outbreak continues to move away from its original epicenter in Asia. China, where the virus was first detected in December, now accounts for less than half of the world’s more than 169,000 cases. In the rush for a vaccine, the first participant in a clinical trial will receive an experimental dose at a research institute in the U.S. Officials, however, caution that it will still take from a year to 18 months to fully validate any potential vaccine.
UNDATED (AP) — The Netherlands has recorded its biggest daily jump in the number of coronavirus infections., with 278 new cases confirmed in the last 24 hours. The new cases reported Monday brought the country's total to 1,413. The Dutch public health institute said four more people also died of COVID-19, bringing the national death toll to 24. The government on Sunday ordered all schools, bars, restaurants, sports clubs and sex clubs closed until April 6. The closures also affected the country’s famed marijuana-selling coffee shops, sparking panic buying of pot before the coffee shops closed Sunday evening. Health Care Minister Bruno Bruins said more restrictive measures are expected to follow.
SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) — Police say five people including an officer and a gunman are dead after a shooting at a gas station in Springfield, Missouri. Police Chief Paul Williams said Monday morning the dead also include three citizens. Williams said police began receiving reports of someone firing shots from a car late Sunday. The car eventually crashed into a Kum & Go gas station and convenience store. Williams said the gunman entered the store and began shooting. Officers Christopher Walsh and Josiah Overton, who arrived at the store first, were shot. The chief says Walsh was killed and Overton suffered non-life threatening injuries. Other officers who entered the store found three people and the gunman dead.

Stocks sink, bonds soar as fears spread that virus will stunt economy
NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks are falling sharply for a second day, as traders worry that the spreading coronavirus will threaten global economic growth. United Airlines and Mastercard joined a growing list of companies warning investors of the virus' impact on their finances. The steep sell-off on Monday erased all of the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s gains for the year. Energy companies fell as crude oil prices moved lower. U.S. government bond prices rose, sending yields even lower.
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE
US consumer confidence rises slightly to 130.7 in February
WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. consumer confidence improved slightly in February, rising to a reading of 130.7, the highest point since August.
The Conference Board said Tuesday that its measure of consumer sentiment is up from a revised reading of 130.4 in January. Consumers views on the present situation for business and labor market conditions fell this month, but their expectations for the future rose.
Conference Board economist Lynn Franco said that consumers continue to view the outlook as favorable and when this is combined with solid employment growth, it should be enough to support continued spending and economic growth in the near term.
Consumer spending has been the driving force in the current economic expansion, now in its 11th year.

US home prices rise 2.9% in December on low rates, inventory
WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. home prices rose at a faster pace in December as mortgage rates remained low and a falling supply of available properties set off bidding wars between buyers.
The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-city home price index climbed 2.9% in December from a year earlier after posting a 2.5% gain in November.
Prices rose in all 20 cities, led by increases of 6.5% in Phoenix, 5.3% in Charlotte, North Carolina and 5.2% in Tampa, Florida. Prices rose just 1% in Chicago and New York.
VIRUS OUTBREAK-VACCINE TESTING
Drugmaker readies possible coronavirus vaccine for testing
UNDATED (AP) — Drugmaker Moderna says it has shipped its first batch of a possible coronavirus vaccine for humans to government researchers for testing.
Shares of the biotech company are soaring Tuesday, a day after the company said it sent vials to an arm of the National Institutes of Health for early-stage testing in the United States.
More than 80,000 people have been infected globally from the viral outbreak that began late last year in China. A total of 35 cases have been reported in the United States. The virus has killed more than 2,700 people globally.
NTSB-TESLA
NTSB: Driver in fatal Tesla crash was playing video game
WASHINGTON (AP) — The National Transportation Safety Board says the driver of a Tesla SUV who died in a Silicon Valley crash two years ago was playing a video game on his smartphone at the time.
Chairman Robert Sumwalt said at the start of a hearing Tuesday that partially automated driving systems like Tesla's Autopilot cannot drive themselves. Yet he says drivers continue to use them without paying attention.
Sumwalt says the board made recommendations to six automakers to stop the problem and only Tesla has failed to respond.
The board will determine a cause of the crash at the hearing and make recommendations to prevent it from happening again.
EARNS-MACY’S
Macy’s has strong fourth quarter heading to transition year
NEW YORK (AP) — Macy's is reporting stronger-than-expected sales and profits for the fourth quarter. The quarterly report comes three weeks after the department store chain said it was closing 125 of its least productive stores and cutting 2,000 corporate jobs as it tests new smaller-store formats.
The company says it's viewing 2020 as a transition year and reiterated its annual profit guidance.
The guidance doesn't include the impact from the new virus in China. However, CEO Jeff Gennette says the department store chain is seeing a slowdown in sales at its 70 U.S. Macy's stores that do a big Asian business.
HOME DEPOT-RESULTS
Home Depot's same-store sales surge in final quarter of 2019
UNDATED (AP) — Home Depot is reporting a better-than-expected fourth quarter with strong comparable-store sales.
The home improvement retailer is also boosting its quarterly dividend by 10%.
Home Depot earned $2.48 billion, or $2.28 per share. That's better than the per-share earnings of $2.11 projected by industry analysts. Home Depot anticipates earnings this year of about $10.45 per share, far better than analysts projections of $10.08.
BANK PROFITS
Banks have second-most-profitable year
NEW YORK (AP) — The banking industry collectively made $233.1 billion in profits in 2019. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said Tuesday it was the industry's second-most profitable year ever.
The slight drop in profits from 2018 is due to the drop in interest rates, which happened in the second half of last year. The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate twice, in an effort to shore up the U.S. economy, which was facing difficulties from the U.S.-China trade war and a slowing manufacturing sector.
FORD RECALL
Ford recalls popular F-150 pickup to fix headlamp problem
DETROIT (AP) — Ford is recalling more than 217,000 pickup trucks mainly in North America to fix a problem with the daytime running lights.
The recall covers certain F-150 trucks with LED headlights from the 2018 through 2020 model years. The Dearborn, Michigan, automaker says the running lights will keep working if the driver moves the headlight switch from auto to the low beam position. U.S. safety standards require vehicles to change to parking lights in that case.
The problem could reduce visibility to other drivers, but Ford says it doesn't know of any crashes.
Dealers will update software to fix the problem.
OPIOID CRISIS-LAWSUITS
Drugmaker Mallinckrodt reaches $1.6B opioid settlement
UNDATED (AP) — The generic drugmaker Mallinckrodt has announced a $1.6 billion deal to settle lawsuits it faces over its role in a national opioid crisis.
The company announced the deal Tuesday, saying it has agreement with most states and lawyers representing local governments suing it.
The English company was one of the highest-volume opioid producers in the U.S. and is seeking bankruptcy protection as part of the deal. The deal comes as more disputes have become public in some other companies' efforts to settle opioid suits.
AMERICAN AIRLINES-QANTAS
American Airlines, Qatar will split revenue on some flights
DALLAS (AP) — American Airlines and Qatar Airways say they are putting aside past differences and reviving a partnership selling seats on some of each other’s flights and sharing the revenue.
American says it hopes the arrangement will boost its ability to sell travel to India and elsewhere in Asia and also to Africa.
The two airlines broke off a similar partnership — called code-sharing — back in 2018 in the middle of a fight over government subsidies for Middle Eastern airlines. The CEO of Qatar Airways even went after flight attendants on U.S. airlines, calling them grandmothers. Now he says that's all in the past.
VAPING INVESTIGATION
39 states investigating Juul's marketing of vaping products
HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Investigators from 39 states will look into the marketing and sales of vaping products by Juul Labs, including whether the company targeted youths and made misleading claims about nicotine content in its devices, officials announced Tuesday.
Attorneys general from Connecticut, Florida, Nevada, Oregon and Texas said they will be leading the multi-state investigation into San Francisco-based Juul, which also is facing numerous lawsuits by teenagers and others who say they became addicted to the company's vaping products.
Juul released a statement saying it has halted television, print and digital advertising and eliminated most flavors in response to concerns by government officials and others.
JPMORGAN-CLIMATE CHANGE
JPMorgan to stop lending to coal companies, arctic drillers
NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. will no longer do business with coal companies and will restrict financing to companies that drill in the Arctic, the company announced Tuesday.
The announcement came in tandem with the bank announcing it would extend $200 billion in financing to clean and renewable energy companies by 2025.
The bank has been holding its annual investor day in San Francisco, where the announcement was made.
AMAZON-GROCERY STORE
No checkout needed: Amazon opens cashier-less grocery store
NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon wants to kill the supermarket checkout line.
The online retailing giant is opening its first cashier-less supermarket, where shoppers can grab milk or eggs and walk out without waiting in line or ever opening their wallets. It's the latest sign that Amazon is serious about shaking up the $800 billion grocery industry.
At the new store, opened Tuesday in Amazon's Seattle hometown, shoppers scan a smartphone app to enter the store. Cameras and sensors track what's taken off shelves. Items are charged to an Amazon account after leaving.

SEATTLE (AP) — The first people to roll up their sleeves to receive an experimental vaccine for the coronavirus say they were inspired to help because they wanted to do more to fight the disease than wash their hands and work from home.
Three of the study participants spoke to The Associated Press on Monday following the trial's first injections in Seattle. They said the shots were no more painful than an ordinary season flu vaccine.
Some will get higher dosages than others to test how strong the dose should be. They will be checked for side effects and have their blood tested to determine whether the vaccine is revving up their immune systems.
The volunteers said they weren't acting in hopes of protecting themselves. They understand their role is a small part of what could be an 18-month hunt for a successful shot that could be distributed widely.
They work in the tech industry and in health research. Two have children, and all three are working from home to slow the spread of COVID-19.
They are a 43-year-old operations manager at a small tech company, a 46-year-old network engineer at Microsoft and a 25-year-old editorial coordinator at an independent global health research center at the University of Washington.
___
Jennifer Haller, 43, still cuts up apples for her 16-year-old son and 13-year-old daughter each morning, even though the teenagers now make their own lunches. She leaves for work before they head to school on a normal day.
On Friday, however, the governor ordered the closure of all Washington state schools that were still open. Her company wants everyone to work from home.
Her husband, a software tester, was laid off last week, a move unrelated to the pandemic. The family's income was cut in half. The job market looks grim.
“I figure we probably need to prepare for him to be off work for six months,” she said.
Haller works as an operations manager at a small tech company that normally runs out of a shared working space in Seattle. She learned of the vaccine study through Facebook on March 3, the day Kaiser Permanente Washington Research Institute started recruiting. She submitted her application immediately.
Two days later, she was dining at a Mexican restaurant when she answered a phone call from an unknown number. It was a member of the research team asking if she wanted to participate and if she had 15 minutes to answer some questions. She interrupted her dinner and agreed.
“We all feel so helpless. This is an amazing opportunity for me to do something,"" she said Monday.
___
Neal Browning, 46, lives in Bothell, Washington, north of Seattle, with his fiancee and their daughters. He works as a network engineer at Microsoft, one of the first companies to require its employees to work remotely.
At a neighborhood gathering Sunday, Browning watched his daughters and other children improvise a game of tag without touching each other. They'd been told about social distancing, a way to fight the virus by staying away from others.
“Kids are fairly adaptable,” Browning said. “If you give them a set of rules, they like to follow them if at all possible.”
Browning and his fiancee have three daughters between them, ages 8, 9 and 11. The girls are proud of him for testing the first vaccine for the new virus, he said.
“Every parent wants their children to look up to them,” Browning said Monday after his shot. But he’s told the girls not to brag to their friends too much. “It’s other people too. It’s not just Dad out there.”
___
Rebecca Sirull, 25, barely stopped working to get her shot Monday, participating in a conference call for work while sitting in the research institute's clinic.
She moved to Seattle from the Boston area in December to work as editorial coordinator for the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.
She lives in an apartment with roommates, and her social life took a hit with the coronavirus restrictions. The ultimate frisbee team she joined for the spring season is no longer playing: “Our very first game was canceled,"" she said.
“The dating scene is kind of on hold for the moment,"" Sirull added. ""You know, people talk about finding their quarantine buddy, but I'm happy to kind of wait another couple months. You know, it's not that pressing an issue right now for me.""
She's heard friends make dark jokes about parallels between the coronavirus pandemic and the start of every zombie apocalypse movie ever made. “I say, ‘No, guys, it doesn’t have to go that way!'”
She joined the vaccine study as “a way to contribute to the situation in a positive way, considering, you know, the main guidelines that we all have right now are to stay home and do nothing, which is sort of a hard message to hear when you want to help out.”

BEIJING (AP) — A new viral illness being watched with a wary eye around the globe accelerated its spread in China with 80 deaths so far, while the U.S. Consulate in the city at the epicenter announced it will evacuate its personnel and some other Americans aboard a charter flight.
China's health minister said the country was entering a “crucial stage"" as “it seems like the ability of the virus to spread is getting stronger.""
Ma Xiaowei declined to estimate how long it would take to bring the situation under control, but said travel restrictions and other strict measures should bring results “at the lowest cost and fastest speed.”
President Xi Jinping has called the outbreak a grave situation and said the government was stepping up efforts to restrict travel and public gatherings while rushing medical staff and supplies to the city at the center of the crisis, Wuhan, which remains on lockdown with no flights, trains or buses in or out.
The epidemic has revived memories of the SARS outbreak that originated in China and killed nearly 800 as it spread around the world in 2002 and 2003. Its spread has come amid China's busiest travel period of the year, when millions crisscross the country or head abroad for the Lunar New Year holiday.
The government said early Monday the death toll had risen to 80, with 2,744 confirmed cases.
The National Health Commission said 769 new cases were confirmed in the 24 hours through midnight Sunday.
The government also reported five cases in Hong Kong and two in Macao. Small numbers of cases have been found in Thailand, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, the U.S., Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Nepal, France and Australia.
The U.S. has confirmed cases in Washington state, Chicago, Southern California and Arizona. Canada said it discovered its first case, a man in his 50s who was in Wuhan before flying to Toronto. Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea each reported one new case Sunday, while Thailand reported three new cases.
A notice from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing said there would be limited capacity to transport U.S. citizens on a Tuesday flight from Wuhan that will proceed directly to San Francisco. It said that in the event there are not enough seats, priority will be given to to individuals “at greater risk from coronavirus.""
The French Consulate also was considering an evacuation of its nationals from the city. It said it's working on arranging a bus service to help French citizens leave Wuhan.
French automaker PSA Group said it will evacuate its employees from Wuhan, quarantine them and then bring them to France.
Japan was also making preparations to fly its nationals out of Wuhan.
Chinese travel agencies have been told to halt all group tours, and concern is growing over the potential impact of millions of people traveling back to the cities after the Lunar New Year holiday ends on Thursday.
China's National Health Commission said anyone traveling from Wuhan is now required to register with community health stations and quarantine themselves at home for 14 days — the virus' maximum incubation period.
Beijing has decided to delay the start of classes after the Lunar New Year holiday ends, the official Beijing Daily reported on its website. That will extend to all schools in the capital from kindergartens to universities.
Hong Kong announced similar measures on Saturday and on Sunday two of that territory's biggest attractions, Hong Kong Disneyland and Ocean Park, announced they were closing for the time being.
A proposal to possibly quarantine suspected cases and others at a still-unoccupied public housing complex in the Hong Kong suburb of Fanling sparked a protest by area residents. Though largely peaceful, they were joined by black-clad protesters like those who have clashed with police during months of anti-government protests and those protesters set a fire in the lobby of one of the buildings.
The fire was extinguished without appearing to cause major damage. Police later moved in n to disperse the group, using pepper spray on occasion.
In the heart of the outbreak where 11 million residents are already on lockdown, Wuhan banned most vehicle use, including private cars, in downtown areas starting Sunday. The city will assign 6,000 taxis to neighborhoods to help people get around if they need to.
China cut off trains, planes and other links to the city Jan. 22, and has steadily expanded the lockdown to 16 surrounding cities with a combined population of more than 50 million — greater than that of New York, London, Paris and Moscow combined.
Wuhan is building two makeshift hospitals with about 1,000 beds each to handle the growing number of patients. The city has said the first is expected to be completed Feb. 3.
Medical workers in Wuhan have been among those infected and local media reported a doctor died on Saturday morning. The 62-year-old physician was hospitalized on Jan. 18 and died a week later.
Xinhua also said medical supplies are being rushed to the city, including 14,000 protective suits, 110,000 pairs of gloves and masks and goggles.
Videos have circulated online showing throngs of frantic people in masks lined up for examinations and there have been complaints that family members had been turned away at hospitals that were at capacity.
The National Health Commission said it is bringing in medical teams to help handle the outbreak and the Chinese military dispatched 450 medical staff, some with experience in past outbreaks, including SARS and Ebola, Xinhua reported.
The new virus comes from a large family of what are known as coronaviruses, some causing nothing worse than a cold. It causes cold- and flu-like symptoms, including cough and fever, and in more severe cases, shortness of breath. It can worsen to pneumonia, which can be fatal.
First detected last month, the virus is believed to have originated in a type of wild animal sold at a Wuhan market to be consumed as food.
Chinese authorities announced a temporary ban on the trade of wild animals Sunday, saying they will “severely investigate and punish” violators. They also called on the public to refrain from eating wild animal meat.
Investigators are closely observing whether the virus was mutating, but thus far found “no obvious signs,"" that it is doing so, head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control, Gao Fu, told reporters.
That could make it easier to develop vaccines against the virus, something the center is already working on. Xinhua quoted center official Xu Wenbo as saying the they had isolated the virus and were identifying seed strain.
The rapid increase in reported deaths and illnesses does not necessarily mean the crisis is getting worse but could reflect better monitoring and reporting of the virus. Those killed by the virus have mostly been middle-aged or elderly people, sometimes suffering from other conditions that weaken their ability to fight back.
It is not clear how lethal the new coronavirus is or even whether it is as dangerous as the ordinary flu, which kills tens of thousands of people every year in the U.S. alone.

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuela confirmed its first two cases of the coronavirus Friday, deepening anxiety in a crisis-stricken nation where many hospitals lack basics such as water and soap and struggle to treat even basic ailments.
The announcement prompted President Iván Duque of neighboring Colombia to order his nation’s border with Venezuela closed as a coronavirus containment measure.
“God help us,” hospital patient Carlos Chacón said after hearing the news that the pandemic had arrived in his native Venezuela.
“My mom is old and sick. So is my father,” said Chacón, a 48-year-old electrician who was first hospitalized four months ago with two broken legs from a motorcycle accident. “Here I am in this condition, stuck in this hospital bed.”
Earlier Friday, Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez delivered the news that Venezuelans feared was coming: A 52-year-old man who had recently traveled from Spain and a 41-year-old woman who had returned from a trip through the U.S., Italy and Spain had been diagnosed with the virus.
Schools across Venezuela immediately closed, a day after President Nicolás Maduro suspended flights with Europe and Colombia in an attempt to ward off the illness.
Juan Guaidó also called off upcoming street demonstrations, taking away one of the U.S-backed opposition leader's tools in his year-long battle to oust Maduro.
Health experts say Venezuela's population is particularly the region’s most vulnerable and worry the virus could easily spread in a nation paralyzed by a political and economic crisis.
The country of roughly 30 million people was once a wealthy oil producer, pumping from the world's largest reserves. Today, it's beset by conflict, poverty and massive power failures that have driven out an estimated 4.5 million migrants in recent years.
Venezuela's government does not publish health care statistics, but there are deep shortages of antibiotics and general supplies, including scarcities of basic items needed to confront an epidemic.
“Most hospitals don’t have water, face masks or even soap,” said Dr. Patricia Valenzuela, board member of the Venezuelan Society of Infectology. “We’re not prepared.”
A report by Humans Rights Watch in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health concluded last year that the health system in Venezuela has ""totally collapsed."" It cited rising levels of maternal and child mortality as well as the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases.
The U.N. World Food Program recently said that nearly one-third of Venezuela's population are unable to meet basic dietary needs.
In response to the news about the coronavirus cases, Venezuelans on Friday rushed to some markets and pharmacies in the capital of Caracas to stock up on food and supplies. By noon, goods were running out.
“If this is the first day, I don't know what's going to happen in a week or in a month,” said Genesis Suarez, a mother. She was shocked to see that a box of 50 face masks costs $31 — a small fortune in a country where most workers earn a monthly minimum wage of $4.50.
“It’s honestly hard to imagine a more fertile playground for the coronavirus than Maduro-era Venezuela,"" said Daniel Lansberg-Rodríguez, a geopolitical risk analyst who teaches at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.
“Its understaffed and ill-supplied healthcare system already collapsed years ago,” he said.
The virus further raised tensions between Venezuela and Colombia, whose government backs Guaidó.
Colombia´s president announced late Friday that all official border crossing with the neighboring Andean nation would be shuttered beginning at 5 a.m. Saturday.
The two nations share a porous 1,370-mile (2,200-kilometer) border that is crossed by thousands of Venezuelans each day searching for food and medicine. In addition, over 4.5 million Venezuelans have fled their homeland in recent years, many arriving in Colombia.
Experts in Colombia are concerned that the migration crisis could exacerbate the spread of coronavirus throughout the region. Colombia has 16 confirmed cases. Several infectious diseases, including measles, have increased in Colombia in recent years, with experts attributing the spike in large part to migration.
Dr. Alfonso Rodríguez-Morales, vice president of the Colombian Association of Infectology, said the Venezuela exodus will inevitably challenge both efforts to contain and respond to the spread of the coronavirus. Many of those fleeing are already weakened by hunger and disease.
“The health system obviously has its limits that could clearly be surpassed in Colombia or in any country in Latin America,” he said. “I don't think any country has has the capacity to handle that.”
The Trump administration this week stepped up pressure aimed at ousting Maduro, hitting a second subsidiary of the Russian state-controlled Rosneft Oil Company with financial sanctions. Russia is a key ally of the Venezuelan president.
Maduro urged the U.S. to lift sanctions, saying they block the nation from buying medicine needed in health emergencies. U.S. officials maintain that the sanctions do not prohibit buying food and medicine.
Chacón winces each time he shifts his weight in a bed at Domingo Luciani Hospital in Caracas. He is struggling to raise $150 for medical treatment, hoping to leave the hospital as soon as possible for fear he could catch the virus there.
“Nothing works well here,” Chacón said. “There's serious problems in health control, food supplies — with everything. Things are tough for us.”

VIRUS OUTBREAK-ARIZONA
Arizona deaths prompt warning against self-medication
PHOENIX (AP) — A Phoenix-area man has died and his wife is in critical condition after the couple took an additive used to clean fish tanks known as chloroquine phosphate, similar to the drug used to treat malaria. Banner Health said on Monday that the couple in their 60s got sick within half an hour. Last week, President Donald Trump touted that the malaria medication chloroquine was a known treatment for COVID-19. The chief of the Food and Drug Administration clarified that the drug still needs to be tested for that use. The woman told NBC that the president said the drug was essentially a cure. She said people should not taking anything and call their doctors. Banner Health is warning against self-medicating.

In global fight vs. virus, over 1.5 billion told: Stay home
NEW YORK (AP) — A fifth of the world's population has been asked or ordered to stay home as coronavirus infections soar. Britain on Monday became the latest European country to effectively lock down. It comes as the hunt for ventilators and other medical supplies is consuming Europe and the U.S. Political paralysis has stalled efforts for quick aid from Congress, sending U.S. stocks down. New York City's mayor says hospitals are 10 days away from running out of basic supplies. Medical gear and hospital space also are in short supply elsewhere. President Donald Trump has signed an executive order making it a crime to stockpile supplies needed by medical workers.

Tensions rise as $2 trillion virus aid stalls in Washington
WASHINGTON (AP) — Washington is straining to respond to the worsening coronavirus outbreak. Tempers are flaring in Congress as lawmakers argue over a nearly $2 trillion economic rescue package. For his part, President Donald Trump is musing openly about letting a 15-day shutdown expire. At the Capitol, emotions are raw as senators wrangle over critically needed aid. Democrats blocked another vote to advance the package, arguing it is tilted toward corporations. They are trying to steer more of the assistance to public health and workers. There are no more votes set for Monday as talks continue, but negotiators still hope to strike a deal late Monday night.
VIRUS OUTBREAK-ECONOMY VS HEALTH
Trump says he intends to reopen country in weeks, not months
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump says he wants to reopen the country for business in weeks, not months, and he claims, without evidence, that continued closures could result in more deaths than the coronavirus pandemic. Trump said Monday that ""we have to open our country because that causes problems that, in my opinion, could be far bigger problems."" Trump acknowledged there are trade-offs but said that if closures stretch on for months, there would be “probably more death from that than anything that we're talking about with respect to the virus.” The comments were further evidence that Trump has grown impatient with the pandemic, even before it has reached its expected peak.
VIRUS OUTBREAK-GOVERNORS
Governors urge feds for more funding, testing, equipment
ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — The nation's governors are continuing to press the federal government for economic help and supplies to battle the coronavirus, but governors say they're still waiting. Governors held a conference call Monday with the White House to keep asking for more resources like ventilators and personal protective equipment. Congress hit another roadblock in talks to inject nearly $2 trillion into the economy. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who chairs the National Governors Association, says federal assistance is critically needed. He says there's been a little bit of progress but not nearly enough and not fast enough.
VIRUS OUTBREAK-FRAUD
Feds: Virus frauds spread, preying on Medicare recipients
WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal law enforcement is warning that scam artists are preying on older people's fears by peddling fake tests for the coronavirus to Medicare recipients. The Health and Human Services inspector general's office says it's also seeing schemes that offer “Senior Care Packages” with hand sanitizer. In Florida, some seniors are being told falsely that President Donald Trump has mandated they get tested. At the White House press conference Monday, Trump said federal authorities had already shut down a website selling “a totally fake vaccine."" Separately, the president signed an order cracking down on large-scale hoarding intended to drive up prices.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The House is considering whether to allow lawmakers to designate a colleague to vote for them if they can't return to Washington amid the coronavirus outbreak. The chairman of the House Rules Committee has proposed voting by proxy for lawmakers who are unable to cast in-person votes. House Rules Committee staff began exploring options for voting after two House members tested positive for the virus. The proposal comes as members of the House are away from Washington, awaiting an agreement in the Senate on a nearly $2 trillion economic rescue package that could come up for a vote this week.
VIRUS OUTBREAK-TESTING MISSTEPS-ABRIDGED
Testing blunders crippled US response as coronavirus spread
WASHINGTON (AP) — An Associated Press review has found that a series of missteps at the nation's top public health agency created a critical shortage of reliable tests for the coronavirus. Those stumbles at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hobbled the federal response as the pandemic spread across the nation. President Donald Trump has assured Americans that “anyone who wants a test can get a test.” But more than two months after the first U.S. coronavirus case was confirmed, many people are still unable to get tested and it can take a week for test results to be returned.
VIRUS OUTBREAK-MALARIA DRUG-EVIDENCE
Malaria drugs' promise for coronavirus spurs hope, shortages
Excitement about treating the new coronavirus with malaria drugs is raising hopes, including with President Donald Trump. But the evidence that they may help is thin, and a run on the drugs is complicating access for people who need them for rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. Chloroquine and a similar drug, hydroxychloroquine, have shown encouraging signs in very small and early tests. But the drugs have major side effects. That's one reason scientists don't want to give them without evidence of their value, even in this emergency. Scientists say major studies are needed to prove the drugs are safe and effective when used for purposes other than those approved now.

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials determined that the seal suffering from toxoplasmosis, the Honolulu Star-Advertiserreported Monday.
The female seal, known as Pohaku, was taken from Ko Olina on Oahu to the agency for monitoring after reports she was “logging,” or lethargically floating on the water.
There are an estimated 50,000 to 300,000 feral cats on Oahu and they are a primary source of toxoplasmosis, a parasite that reproduces in the digestive system of cats, the agency said on its website.
Hawaiian monk seals are exposed to the parasitic eggs spread by cat feces when they consume contaminated prey or water, the NOAA said.
Toxoplasmosis can destroy muscle, liver, heart, and brain tissue and cause organ failure. There is no vaccine and treatment options for infected seals are extremely limited.
Officials were “very guarded in our optimism” about Pohaku's condition, the NOAA said.
“Despite aggressive treatment, she is very lethargic, a sign that the infection is causing pain and severe inflammation throughout her internal organs,” the agency said.
Eleven Hawaiian monk seals are known to have died from toxoplasmosis, although the number is likely higher because of unreported cases.
Toxoplasmosis affects other marine animals including spinner dolphins and native birds including alala, or Hawaiian crows.

FINANCIAL MARKETS
US stocks extend rally as companies report solid earnings
NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks are extending their rally on Wall Street as investors assess the latest batch of solid corporate earnings reports and set aside fears about economic fallout from the virus outbreak that originated in China.
Major indexes are heading into a third straight day of gains and the S&P 500 index is within range of another record high.
Versace parent Capri Holdings jumped 10% and CoverGirl owner Coty jumped 12.7% for some of the strongest gains as Wall Street rewarded their results, which easily beat analysts' forecasts.
Health care companies made solid gains. Insurance giant UnitedHealth Group and drug developer Amgen were standouts.
Crude oil prices jumped 3.7% and lifted energy stocks. Exxon Mobil gained 3.6%.
TRADE GAP
US trade deficit drops 1.7% last year to $616.8 billion
WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. trade deficit fell for the first time in six years in 2019 as President Donald Trump hammered China with import taxes.
The Commerce Department said Wednesday that the gap between what the United States sells and what it buys abroad fell 1.7% last year to $616.8 billion. U.S. exports fell 0.1% to $2.5 trillion. But imports fell more, slipping 0.4% to $3.1 trillion. Imports of crude oil plunged 19.3% to $126.6 billion.
The deficit in the trade of goods with China narrowed last year by 17.6% to $345.6 billion. Trump has imposed tariffs on $360 billion worth of Chinese imports in a battle over Beijing’s aggressive drive to challenge American technological dominance. The world’s two biggest economies reached an interim trade deal last month, and Trump dropped plans to extend the tariffs to another $160 billion in Chinese goods.
But goods trade gap with Mexico rose 26.2% last year to a record $101.8 billion. The goods deficit with the European Union also hit a record, $177.9 billion -- up 5.5% from 2018.
Overall, the United States posted a $866 billion deficit in the trade of goods such as cars and appliances, down from $887.3 billion in 2018. But it ran a $249.2 billion surplus in the trade of services such as tourism and banking, down from $260 billion in 2018.
ADP-EMPLOYMENT
Survey: US companies added 291,000 jobs in January
WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. companies added 291,000 jobs in January, a big increase from December, but much of that strength likely reflected unusually warm weather during the month.
Payroll processor ADP said Wednesday that the January job gain, which was larger than had been expected, compared to a revised December figure of 193,000.
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said that warmer-than-normal weather for January played a big role in the increase. He said without that impact, the job gain would probably have been around 150,000.
The Labor Department releases its January jobs report on Friday. Many analysts expect that report will show a job gain of 150,000 in January, compared to 145,000 jobs in the government’s report in December. Analysts believe the unemployment rate will remain at a 50-year low of 3.5%.
ECONOMY-SERVICES
US services companies grew at a slightly faster pace
WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. services companies grew at a slightly faster pace in January than the previous month, an indicator of continued steady expansion of the economy.
The Institute for Supply Management said Wednesday that its service-sector index edged up to 55.5 from 55 in December. Any reading above 50 signals an expansion. The index covers retail, health care, hotels and restaurants, and professional services, among other sectors.
Services companies added jobs at a slower pace last month than in December, while sales increased.
The industries covered by the ISM’s services survey make up nearly 90% of the economy.
GENERAL MOTORS-RESULTS
GM churns out profit in 2019 despite strike, slumping sales
DETROIT (AP) — Despite a 40-day strike by factory workers and slumping sales in the U.S. and China, General Motors still made money last year.
The company posted a $6.58 billion profit for the year, but that was down almost 17% from 2018.
GM couldn't avoid red ink the fourth quarter. The automaker lost $232 million, or 16 cents per share, largely because most of the strike by the United Auto Workers union happened during the quarter.
Excluding one-time items for employee separations and the sale of a Chinese joint venture, GM made 5 cents per share, soundly beating Wall Street estimates.
Revenue for the quarter was $30.8 billion, down almost 20% from a year ago.
The company still made $8.2 billion in North America for the full year, so about 44,000 U.S. factory workers will get $8,000 profit-sharing checks this month. That's down from $10,750 in 2018.
GM said the strike, which ran from Sept. 16 through Oct. 25, cost the company sales of 191,000 vehicles and cut quarterly pretax earnings by $1.39 per share. For the full year, the strike cost GM $1.89 per share.
EARNS-MERCK
Merck to spin off assets with $6.5B in sales; 4Q profit up
UNDATED (AP) — Drugmaker Merck beat Wall Street's fourth-quarter profit expectations, but investors weren't as happy with the biggest move Merck's made in years: deciding to spin off its women's health division and other operations with $6.5 billion in annual revenues.
The maker of cancer blockbuster Keytruda announced the plan along with its quarterly results, saying the two resulting companies each would be able to grow faster and develop more new medicines, benefiting patients. But investors sold off shares in heavy trading early Wednesday, pushing their price down more than 4% initially.
The maneuver culminates a steady shift of Merck's business the past several years from a primary care drugmaker with more than 160 products, to a company which will have with half as many, focused on its surging but young oncology business, and growing sales of its vaccine, hospital products and veterinary medicines.
FACEBOOK-ANTI-SEMITISM
Facebook takes down anti-Semitic page, governor says
TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — Facebook has agreed to shutter the public page of a group the administration has identified as anti-Semitic, according to New Jersey’s governor.
Gov. Phil Murphy said Wednesday, in a joint statement with state Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, that the social media giant agreed to “take down the public page” of a group called Rise Up Ocean County, which purported to be focused on development in the shore community. Among the posts on the group page, according to the attorney general, was a video in which the group predicted that a group of Orthodox rabbis would lead to the “colonization” of Lakewood, in Ocean County.
The development comes after Grewal's office wrote in April to Facebook to make the social network aware of the page.
A message was left with Facebook seeking more details about its decision.

JAN. 3: The number of cases of a new type of viral pneumonia in central China rises to 44 in an outbreak that awakens fearful memories of the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic. Most of the cases are traced to the South China Seafood City market in the suburbs of sprawling Wuhan, where offerings are reported to include wild animals.
JAN 9: Chinese state media report that a preliminary investigation of viral pneumonia in the city of Wuhan has identified a new type of coronavirus. Local authorities report 59 people with the illness.
JAN. 11: Health authorities in Wuhan report the country's first death from the new coronavirus.
JAN. 20: The head of a Chinese government team says human-to-human transmission has been confirmed in an outbreak of the coronavirus, a development that raises the possibility that it could spread more quickly and widely.
JAN. 21: Face masks sell out and air and rail passengers are checked for fever as China seeks to control the outbreak, which has reached four other countries and territories and threatens to spread further during the Lunar New Year travel rush. The U.S. reports its first case — a Washington state resident who recently returned from the outbreak's epicenter and was hospitalized near Seattle.
JAN. 22: Chinese state media report that the city of Wuhan has shut down outbound flights and trains as new virus keeps spreading.
JAN. 23: The World Health Organization says the viral illness in China that has sickened hundreds of people is not yet a global health emergency. The decision comes after Chinese authorities moved to lock down three cities and canceled major events in the capital, Beijing, during the Lunar New Year holiday period to try to contain the virus.
JAN. 24: China reports that the number of virus cases has increased to 1,287, and the death toll risen to 41.
JAN. 26: The U.S. confirms five cases of the new virus, all among people who traveled to the Chinese city at the center of the outbreak.
JAN. 28: U.S. health officials expand screenings of international travelers and take other precautions. But they insist the risk to Americans is low. “At this point, Americans should not worry for their own safety,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar tells reporters.
JAN. 29: The 195 Americans evacuated from the Chinese city at the center of the outbreak undergo three days of testing and monitoring at a California military base to ensure they do not show signs of the illness.
JAN. 30: The World Health Organization declares the outbreak a global emergency after the number of cases spikes more than tenfold in a week. U.S. President Donald Trump offers some of his most extensive comments on the virus to date during an appearance at a Michigan manufacturing plant. “Hopefully, it won't be as bad as some people think it could be, but we're working very closely with them (China) and with a lot of other people and a lot of other countries,"" he said. “We think we have it very well under control.” Trump described the handful of U.S. cases as a “very little problem” and said those people were “recuperating successfully.”
“We think it's going to have a very good ending for us. That I can assure you,” he said.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross suggests in an interview that the outbreak might offer an unexpected benefit for the U.S. economy by encouraging American manufacturers in China to return to the United States.
JAN. 31: United Airlines, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines suspend all flights to and from China as the virus spreads. The United States declares a public health emergency and takes drastic steps to restrict entry. Trump signs an order that will temporarily bar foreign nationals, other than immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, who have traveled in China within the last 14 days.
FEB. 4: German health officials raise questions about a report that suggests the new virus could be spread by people who are not yet showing symptoms. The report, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, stirs concern that controlling the virus will be more daunting if it is spreading before people know they are sick. A Japanese official says at least 10 people on cruise ship have new virus and all 3,700 people on it will be quarantined.
FEB. 6: A Chinese doctor who got in trouble with authorities in the communist country for sounding an early warning about the coronavirus outbreak dies after coming down with the illness. Dr. Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old ophthalmologist, was reprimanded by local police for “spreading rumors” about the illness in late December.
FEB. 11: The disease caused by the virus gets an official name: COVID-19. The World Health Organization says it wanted a name that did not refer to a geographical location, an animal, an individual or group of people but was “pronounceable and related to the disease.""
FEB. 12: Japan’s health ministry says 39 new cases of the virus are confirmed on a cruise ship quarantined at a Japanese port. The update brings the total found on the Diamond Princess to 174 cases.
FEB. 15: China reports 143 virus deaths and a dip in new cases. The head of the World Health Organization praises the country's efforts to contain the new disease, saying Chinese officials have ""bought the world time"" and that other nations must make the most of it.
FEB. 19: Iran's state-run IRNA news agency says the virus has killed two Iranian citizens.
FEB. 21: Italy sees confirmed virus cases more than quadruple due to an emerging cluster in the country's north.
FEB. 24: Wall Street endures its worst session in two years, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumping more than 1,000 points on fears that the viral outbreak that began in China will weaken the world economy.
FEB. 25: Stocks slump again, driving the S&P 500 down 3%, as fears grow that the virus will slow the global economy. Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, seeks to ease volatile markets by assuring investors that the administration has the virus “contained” and “it was pretty close to airtight.” Kudlow added that coronavirus may be a “human tragedy,” but he predicted it would not be an “economic tragedy.” At one point, when the stock market was plunging, he mentioned the prospect of “buying the dip.”
FEB. 27: President Trump declares that a widespread U.S. outbreak of the virus is not inevitable, even as top health authorities at his side warn Americans that more infections are coming.
FEB. 28: Nigerian authorities confirm the first case of the virus in sub-Saharan Africa as the outbreak spreads to a region with some of the world's weakest health systems. Trump lashes out at Democrats who question his handling of the virus threat, calling their criticism a “hoax” intended to undermine his leadership.
FEB. 29: As the virus spreads rapidly in central China, the country’s authoritarian government orders the unprecedented lockdown of 60 million people in the hardest-hit province. The shutdown of public transport in some cities, the closing of entertainment venues nationwide and a heavy dose of fear empty the streets of the world’s most populous nation. The virus claims its first victim in the United States, and the number of cases shoot up in Iran, Italy and South Korea.
MARCH 1: Seeking to reassure the American public, President Trump says there is ""no reason to panic"" about the virus. The White House also announces that the U.S. is banning travel to Iran and urging Americans not to travel to regions of Italy and South Korea where the virus has been prevalent.
MARCH 3: In a surprise move, the Federal Reserve cuts its benchmark interest rate by a sizable half-percentage point in an effort to support the economy in the face of the spreading coronavirus.
MARCH 4: The Italian government orders all sporting events to take place without fans until April 3 due to the outbreak.
MARCH 5: The Senate passes an $8.3 billion measure to provide federal public health agencies money for vaccines, tests and potential treatments. The package also helps state and local governments respond to the threat. The House already approved the measure. Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, cast the sole no vote. He would later become the first senator to test positive for the virus.
MARCH 6: President Trump's visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention turns into a scattershot defense of his administration's handling of the outbreak, veering into political score-settling and exaggerations. He calls Washington’s governor a “snake.” He also says he would prefer that people exposed to the virus on a cruise ship be left aboard so they will not be added to the count for the nation's total number of infections. And he falsely claimed that a test for the virus was available immediately to all who want it.
MARCH 8: Italy's prime minister announces a sweeping coronavirus quarantine, restricting the movements of about a quarter of the country's population in a bid to limit contagions at the epicenter of Europe's outbreak. Shortly after midnight, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte signs a decree affecting about 16 million people in the country's prosperous north, including the Lombardy region, and at least 14 provinces in neighboring regions. The extraordinary measures are to be in place until April 3.
MARCH 11: The province at the center of China’s virus outbreak begins allowing factories and some other businesses to reopen in a show of confidence that Beijing is gaining control over the disease that devastated its economy. Wall Street’s staggering skid pulls the Dow Jones Industrial Average into a bear market. The Dow has now fallen more than 20% from its last peak on Feb. 12. President Trump says the U.S. will suspend all travel from Europe, excluding the United Kingdom, for 30 days.
MARCH 12: The NBA becomes the first major American sports league to suspend play because of the pandemic. The NCAA soon cancels men's and women's Division I basketball tournaments. Also, New York's governor orders all Broadway theaters to shut their doors. President Trump says he is temporarily halting his political rallies.
MARCH 13: Trump declares a national emergency in response to the spread of the virus. The declaration begins the process under which state and tribal governments can seek federal dollars for help responding to the virus. Louisiana becomes first state to postpone its presidential primary because of the pandemic. Visits to inmates at all 122 federal prisons are halted for 30 days.
MARCH 14: Spain locks down its 46 million citizens, and France orders the closing of just about everything the rest of the world loves about it — the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, the cafes and restaurants — as governments take increasingly desperate measures to put more space between people and contain the coronavirus. Trump's doctor says the president has tested negative for the coronavirus.
MARCH 16: The Peace Corps tells volunteers around the world that it is suspending all operations globally and evacuating all volunteers in light of the spread of the virus. The Supreme Court postpones arguments. The Trump administration urges older people and others at increased risk to stay home and keep away from other people. The Dow dives 13%, its worst drop in three decades, as fears deepen that virus will throw global economy into recession.
MARCH 17: The Trump administration says individuals and businesses will be allowed to delay paying their 2019 tax bills for 90 days past the usual April 15 deadline. The extension is an effort to inject up to $300 billion into the economy at a time when the coronavirus appears on the verge of causing a recession. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak orders a monthlong closure of casinos and other nonessential businesses like bars, movie theaters and gyms.
MARCH 18: Trump says he will invoke Defense Production Act to marshal the private sector in response to the pandemic. The Census Bureau announces it is suspending all field operations until early April.
MARCH 19: Italy overtakes China as the country with most coronavirus-related deaths, registering 3,405 dead. The California governor issues statewide order for people to stay at home.
MARCH 20: Stocks close out their worst week since 2008 as economic woes from coronavirus seem sure to deepen; Dow sinks 900 points. Illinois and New York state join California in ordering all residents to stay in their homes unless they have vital reasons to go out, restricting the movement of more than 70 million Americans in the most sweeping measures undertaken yet in the U.S. to contain the virus.
MARCH 22: Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky tests positive for the coronavirus, becoming the first case of COVID-19 in the Senate and raising fears about the further transmission of the virus among Republicans at the Capitol. Paul, an eye surgeon, went into quarantine after learning his results.
MARCH 23: British Prime Minster Boris Johnson orders closure of most stores, bans gatherings for three weeks to stop coronavirus.
MARCH 24: The International Olympic Committee postpones this summer's Tokyo Games for a year. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve takes several aggressive steps to support an economy ravaged by the effects of the virus. The amount of money involved is huge and the Fed's ambitions are vast. It wants to make loans available to companies and governments so they can pay bills and potentially avoid layoffs. The Fed also committed to buy as much government debt and as many mortgage-backed securities as it deems necessary. Meanwhile, Trump eyes loosening virus restrictions, says he hopes to have country “opened up and just raring to go by Easter.”
MARCH 25: Palace announces that heir to the British throne Prince Charles tests positive for coronavirus, has mild symptoms. Senate leaders race to unravel last-minute snags and win passage of an unparalleled $2 trillion economic rescue package that steers aid to businesses, workers and health care systems engulfed by the pandemic.
MARCH 27: Trump signs an unprecedented $2.2 trillion economic rescue package into law after swift and near-unanimous action by Congress to support businesses, rush resources to overburdened health care providers and help struggling families during the deepening epidemic. Leaders acted with unity and resolve unseen since the 9/11 attacks to stem an economic free fall.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits in the two months since the coronavirus took hold in the U.S. has swelled to nearly 39 million, the government reported Thursday, even as states from coast to coast gradually reopen their economies and let people go back to work.
More than 2.4 million people filed for unemployment last week in the latest wave of layoffs from the business shutdowns that have brought the economy to its knees, the Labor Department said.
That brings the running total to a staggering 38.6 million, a job-market collapse unprecedented in its speed.
The number of weekly applications has slowed for seven straight weeks. Yet the figures remain breathtakingly high — 10 times higher than normal before the crisis struck.
It shows that even though all states have begun reopening over the past three weeks, employment has yet to snap back and the outbreak is still damaging businesses and destroying jobs.
“While the steady decline in claims is good news, the labor market is still in terrible shape,” said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said over the weekend that U.S. unemployment could peak in May or June at 20% to 25%, a level last seen during the depths of the Great Depression almost 90 years ago. Unemployment in April stood at 14.7%, a figure also unmatched since the 1930s.
Over 5 million people worldwide have been confirmed infected by the virus, and more than 330,000 deaths have been recorded, including over 94,000 in the U.S. and around 165,000 in Europe, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University and based on government data. Experts believe the true toll is significantly higher.
In other developments:
— President Donald Trump’s approval ratings have remained steady amid the crisis, underscoring the way Americans seem to have made up their minds about him. A poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research says 41% approve of his job performance, while 58% disapprove. That’s consistent with opinions of him throughout his three years in office.
— Trump made a trip to Michigan to tour a Ford factory that has been retooled to manufacture ventilators, and he did not wear a face covering despite a warning from the state’s top law enforcement officer that a refusal might lead to a ban on his return. The president has been locked in a feud with Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer over the outbreak and also has threatened to withhold federal funds over Michigan's expansion of voting by mail.
— Whitmer has prevailed after Republican lawmakers sued over her authority to declare emergencies and order sweeping restrictions during the pandemic. The Republican-controlled Legislature didn't extend her declaration in late April but she acted anyway. That means her stay-at-home decree stands, which has drawn anger from gun-toting protesters and is likely to be extended beyond May 28.
Across the U.S., some companies have begun to rehire their laid-off employees as states have eased restrictions on movement and commerce. On Monday, more than 130,000 workers at the three major American automakers, plus Toyota and Honda, returned to their factories for the first time in two months.
Still, major employers keep cutting jobs. Uber said this week that it will lay off 3,000 more employees because demand for rides has plummeted. Digital publishers Vice, Quartz and BuzzFeed, magazine giant Conde Nast and the owner of The Economist magazine announced job cuts last week.
Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, said the latest layoffs may be particularly worrisome because they are happening even as states reopen.
“There’s a high probability that those layoffs could persist for longer than those that were a function of (businesses) just being closed,” Stanley said.
The latest figures do not mean 38.6 million people are out of work. Some have been called back, and others have landed new jobs. But the vast majority are still unemployed.
An additional 1.2 million people applied for unemployment benefits last week under a federal program that makes self-employed, contractor and gig workers eligible for the first time. But those figures aren’t adjusted for seasonal variations, so the government doesn’t include them in the overall number of applications.
Alexis Weber, laid off from her job as a bartender at an Atlanta restaurant, said it was a struggle to secure unemployment benefits — she filed on April 1 and had to wait until early May to get her first payment. She is not sure when her employer will want her back, or if she will want to return.
“Social distancing doesn’t really apply very well to the hospitality business,” Weber said. “I don’t feel safe returning right now.”
One rehired worker, Norman Boughman, received an email last week from his boss at a secondhand clothing store in Richmond, Virginia, where he worked part time, asking him to return. But even with a mask, he worries about his health.
“We’re having to sort through people’s things, and I feel like that puts us at a higher risk,” he said.
European countries also have seen heavy job losses, but robust government safety-net programs in places like Germany and France are subsidizing the wages of millions of workers and keeping them on the payroll.
Meanwhile, doubts are growing over ambitious plans by European governments to use contact-tracing smartphone apps to fight the spread of the virus as they ease their lockdowns. The apps can help authorities determine whether people have crossed paths with those who are infected.
British Security Minister James Brokenshire told the BBC that an app that was supposed to be introduced by mid-May is not ready, suggesting “technical issues” were to blame. Similarly, France delayed last week's roll-out of its app because of technical problems and privacy concerns.
As for the search for a vaccine, drugmaker AstraZeneca said it has secured agreements to produce 400 million doses of a still experimental and unproven formulation that is being tested at the University of Oxford. It is one of the most advanced projects in the international race for a vaccine.
AstraZeneca said it has received more than $1 billion from a U.S. government research agency for the development, production and delivery of the vaccine.
Around the world, the effort to get back to business is raising worries over the risk of new infections, from hard-hit Milan, Italy, to meatpacking plants in Colorado and garment factories in Bangladesh.
China's top economic official promised higher spending to revive the economy and curb job losses as the fight persists against the virus, which emerged in Wuhan late last year. The budget deficit will swell by 1 trillion yuan ($140 billion) this year to help meet targets that include creating 9 million jobs, Premier Li Keqiang said at the country's ceremonial legislature.

WASHINGTON (CNN) — A second coronavirus outbreak could emerge this winter in conjunction with the flu season to make for an even more dire health crisis, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told The Washington Post in an interview.
""There's a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through,"" CDC Director Robert Redfield said in a story published Tuesday. ""And when I've said this to others, they kind of put their head back, they don't understand what I mean.""
""We're going to have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time,"" he added, predicting a dual assault on the health care system.
While there are shots to help prevent the flu and drugs to help treat it — unlike with the novel coronavirus, which still has no approved treatment or vaccine — it remains a deadly infection.
The flu season has been underway since September, and while flu activity now is considered low, the season has seen a high number of hospitalizations and infections, killing at least 168 children, according to the CDC. Last year, the flu killed at least 34,200 Americans, according to the CDC, and made an estimated 35.5 million people sick.
To have both the flu and the coronavirus circulating at the same time could overwhelm hospitals and doctors' offices that are already stretched thin in a bad flu season.
White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx was asked during Tuesday's news briefing about Redfield's comments and how such a confluence of coronavirus and the seasonal flu could affect plans to reopen the country.
""We were very clear in the guidelines that we believe we can monitor, again, monitor communities at the community level by using the influenza-like illness,"" she said, adding that they are working to build testing capacity and it's important to ""have testing in place.""
Pressed again on whether she thinks a second wave could be worse, Birx said, ""I don't know if it will be worse, I think this has been pretty bad. When you see what happened in New York, that was very bad. I believe that we'll have early warning signals both from our surveillance that we've been talking about in these vulnerable populations. We're going to continue that surveillance from now all the way through to be able to give us that early warning signal.""
Redfield's comments come as several governors look to partially reopen their states' economies by loosening some restrictions aimed at limiting the spread of the virus — despite concerns of subsequent increases in coronavirus cases.
Protesters have come out in multiple states against governors' orders that largely adhere to federal guidelines, and President Donald Trump has encouraged them to ""LIBERATE"" their states in tweets.
When asked about the protests and the subsequent calls to open states earlier, Redfield said that ""it's not helpful.""
While Trump unveiled guidance last week to help states loosen their social distancing restrictions, Redfield called for state officials to spend the next few months preparing for the next phase by continuing to tout social distancing and scaling up testing and contact tracing.
Looking ahead, Redfield cited the need for a preventative campaign to emphasize the importance of flu shots to reduce flu hospitalizations. He said that getting a flu vaccine ""may allow there to be a hospital bed available for your mother or grandmother that may get coronavirus.""

NEW YORK (AP) — Wading into a politically charged issue, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday preached the importance of wearing masks in public as the nation's economy reopens from the “cataclysmic"" damage inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic.
During a tour of hospitals this week in his home state of Kentucky, the Republican leader has stressed wearing masks in public and following social distancing guidelines.
“There should be no stigma attached to wearing a mask,"" McConnell said during an appearance in Owensboro. “And even among age groups that are least likely to either contract this disease or die from it, you could be a carrier. So I think what we all need to do is say, ‘OK, I’m going to take responsibility not only for myself but for others.’”
McConnell, who is in his late 70s and is in the midst of his own reelection campaign, has worn masks at his appearances. On Thursday, he stuffed the face covering into his coat jacket to speak. He donned it again afterward.
His mask-wearing is in stark contrast to the unwillingness of a key political ally to do so. President Donald Trump has refused to wear face coverings, and polls find that conservative Americans are more likely to forgo them. McConnell did not mention the president while touting the use of masks.
Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear has repeatedly stressed the use of masks as people increasingly venture out as the economy gradually gets rebooted.
“This is not a battle between political parties or ideologies,” the Democratic governor said recently. “It’s plain, basic public health guidance that’s out there from the CDC and from everywhere else. It’s the same guidance on the federal and on the state level. And it’s just smart, right?”
Even as government restrictions to combat the virus are easing, the fallout reached a flashpoint in Kentucky last weekend when armed protesters gathered at the State Capitol. Protesters swarmed outside the Governor's Mansion and hanged Beshear in effigy near the statehouse.
The rally was billed as a defense of constitutional rights, including the right to bear arms, but turned into a protest against coronavirus restrictions and Beshear’s administration, according to media reports. Beshear condemned the rally and vowed not to back down. McConnell denounced the protesters’ actions as “completely outrageous and unacceptable.”
On Thursday, McConnell termed the pandemic as a “cataclysmic event"" for the economy as businesses shuttered to try to contain the disease.
The senator listed three factors he said were key to getting back to “full normalcy” from the health crisis — testing, treatment and a vaccine. He said earlier in the week that “the ultimate solution"" is getting a vaccine developed and into circulation as quickly as possible. McConnell said he was upbeat about those prospects after speaking recently with pharmaceutical executives.
“We’re going to get on top of this at warp speed compared to any other serious virus that the world has been afflicted with in the past,"" he said Thursday.
McConnell, who is seeking a seventh term this year, has toured hospitals to thank health care workers for battling the virus and to tout federal virus-relief aid sent to Kentucky. The events were his first public appearances in the Bluegrass State since mid-March due to the pandemic.

TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares are mostly higher, with Tokyo stocks gaining on expectations that a pandemic state of emergency will be lifted for all of Japan.
But shares fell in Hong Kong on Monday after police used tear gas to quell weekend protests over a proposed national security bill for the former British colony.
U.S. markets will be closed for Memorial Day.
Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 added 1.5% in morning trading to 20,682.78. South Korea’s Kospi gained 0.6% to 1,981.92. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 jumped 1.4% to 5,572.30.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 1.2% to 22,659.62. The Shanghai Composite was little changed, edging 0.1% higher to 2,815.94.
The protests in Hong Kong, in response to legislation under discussion by China's National People's Congress, which is now meeting in Beijing, were the largest in months despite bans on large gathering meant to prevent spreading the coronavirus.
The revival of sometimes violent pro-democracy protests that rocked the city for much of 2019 raises the likelihood of more tensions between Beijing and Washington over China's efforts to exert more control over the semi-autonomous territory.
“With more riots in the street amid the knockdown effects of COVID-19 and a possible exodus of jobs from the city's financial center, surely things will get much worse before better,"" Stephen Innes of AxiCorp said in a commentary.
Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, was expected to announced later Monday that the state of emergency imposed to fight the pandemic will end nationwide after a panel of experts approved the plan.
Japan has been gradually relaxing calls for people to stay home and for some businesses to stay closed as reports of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and related deaths have declined. Japan has reported about 820 deaths and more than 16,000 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus, relatively few compared to hard-hit nations like the U.S.
The prime minister's announcement is set to come after markets close, but the move is already being factored in. Some department stores and restaurants have already reopened, including in Tokyo, where the emergency is technically still in place.
Although people are wearing masks and having their temperatures taken at the doors of some public places, fears persist that a resumption of normal economic activity and fewer social distancing precautions will bring on a resurgence of infections.
Wall Street ended the week with a gain. The S&P 500 index inched up 0.2% to to 2,955.45. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up less than 0.1% to 24,465.16. The Nasdaq composite added 39.71 points, or 0.4%, to 9,324.59.
Despite the uneven finish, the three major stock indexes each ended the week more than 3% higher, while the Russell 2000 index of small company stocks jumped 7.8% for the week. On Friday, the Russell 2000 gained 0.6% to 1,355.53.
Fresh hopes for a U.S. economic recovery in the second half of the year and optimism about a potential vaccine for COVID-19 helped spur stocks higher for much of the week. Investors are betting, despite concerns over the risks of reigniting outbreaks of the virus, that the economy and corporate profits will begin to recover from the pandemic as the U.S. and countries around the world slowly open up again.
In other trading Monday, benchmark U.S. crude oil picked up 2 cents to $33.27 a barrel. It fell 2%, or 67 cents, to $33.25 a barrel on Friday. Brent crude oil, the international standard, fell 22 cents to $34.91 a barrel.
Crude oil started the year at about $60 a barrel and then plummeted as demand sank due to widespread travel and business shutdowns related to the coronavirus.
The U.S. dollar inched up to 107.72 Japanese yen from 107.63 yen late Friday. The euro inched down to $1.0892 from $1.0901.

CHICAGO (AP) — These are children of the pandemic.
In the far-north Canadian town of Iqaluit, one boy has been glued to the news to learn everything he can about the coronavirus. A girl in Australia sees a vibrant future, tinged with sadness for the lives lost. A Rwandan boy is afraid the military will violently crack down on its citizens when his country lifts the lockdown.
There is melancholy and boredom, and a lot of worrying, especially about parents working amid the disease, grandparents suddenly cut off from weekend visits, friends seen only on a video screen.
Some children feel safe and protected. Others are scared. And yet, many also find joy in play, and even silliness.
Associated Press reporters around the world asked kids about living with the virus and to use art to show us what they believe the future might hold. Some sketched or painted, while others sang, danced ballet, built with LEGOs. A few just wanted to talk.
In the remote forests of northern California, one boy, a Karuk Indian, wrote a rap song to express his worries about how his tribe of just 5,000 will survive the pandemic.
Their worries are matched in many places by resilience and hope, for a life beyond the virus.
This is life under lockdown, through the eyes of children.

LILITHA JIPHETHU, 11, SOUTH AFRICA
Lilitha Jiphethu has made a ball out of discarded plastic grocery bags to keep her amused during the lockdown. She and her four siblings play with that makeshift ball almost every day in a small scrub of ground that they’ve fenced off outside their home.
The 11-year-old screams as her brothers throw the ball at her. Then she laughs, picks up the ball and throws it back at them. This happens again and again.
Lilitha’s house is like hundreds of others in this informal settlement of families just outside Johannesburg, South Africa’s biggest city. It’s made of sheets of scrap metal nailed to wooden beams.
Like many children under lockdown, she misses her friends and her teachers and especially misses playing her favorite game, netball. But she understands why school is closed and why they are being kept at home.
“I feel bad because I don’t know if my family (can catch) this coronavirus,” Lilitha says. “I don’t like it, this corona.”
She prefers singing to drawing and chooses to sing a church song in her first language, Xhosa, as her way of describing the future after the pandemic. She misses her choir but takes comfort in the song’s lyrics.
She smiles as she begins. Her sweet voice drifts through the one-room home.
“I have a friend in Jesus,” she sings. “He is loving and he’s not like any other friend.
“He is not deceitful. He is not ashamed of us.
“He is truthful, and he is love.”

HUDSON DRUTCHAS, 12, UNITED STATES
Hudson Drutchas waited and worried as his mom and sister recovered from coronavirus, quarantined in their rooms. Just a few weeks earlier, he was a busy sixth-grader at Lasalle II, a public elementary school in Chicago. Then the governor issued a stay-at-home order.
Now, the soft-spoken 12-year-old receives school assignments by computer and looks to dog Ty and cat Teddy for comfort.
“Since I don’t get to see my friends a lot, they’re kind of my closest friends,” he says. He giggles when Teddy, now 9, snarls. “He sometimes gets really grumpy because he’s an old man. But we still love him a lot.”
When not doing schoolwork, Hudson jumps and flips on his trampoline and lifts himself around a doorframe outfitted so he can practice climbing, something he usually does competitively.
He knows he’s fortunate, with a good home and family to keep him safe, but it’s difficult to be patient. “It makes me feel sad that I am missing out on a part of my childhood,” he says.
When he draws his version of the future, Hudson makes a detailed pencil sketch showing life before the coronavirus and after.
The world before looks stark and full of pollution in the drawing. In the future, the city is lush with clear skies and more wildlife and trees.
“I think the environment might kind of, like, replenish itself or maybe grow back,” Hudson says.
Still, he feels uncertain: “I’m worried about just how life will be after this. Like, will life change that much?”

ALEXANDRA KUSTOVA, 12, RUSSIA
Hard times can have a silver lining. Alexandra Kustova has come to understand this during this pandemic.
Now that all her studies are conducted online, she has more time for her two favorite hobbies -- ballet and jigsaw puzzles. The 12-year-old also able to spend more time with her family and help her grandmother, who lives in the same building, two floors down at their apartment in Yekaterinburg, a city in the Urals, a mountain range that partly divides Europe and Asia.
Together, they take time to water tomato plants and enjoy one another’s company. Time has slowed down.
“Before that I would have breakfast with them, rush out to school, come back, have dinner, go to ballet classes, come back -- and it would already be time to go to bed,” Alexandra says.
Ballet has been her passion since she was 8. Now she does classes at home and sends videos of her drills to the trainer, who gives her feedback.
The dance she shows for an AP reporter begins slowly and finishes with leaps in the air.
Just like the pandemic, Alexandra says, it is “sad in the beginning and then it becomes joyful.”
“I believe the end is joyful because we must keep on living, keep on growing,” she says.

TRESOR NDIZIHIWE, 12, RWANDA
No school. No playing with friends. Soldiers everywhere. That’s life during the coronavirus pandemic for Tresor Ndizihiwe, a 12-year-old boy who lives in Rwanda, one of seven brothers and sisters.
Their mother, Jacqueline Mukantwari is paid $50 a month as a schoolteacher, but she used to earn extra money giving private lessons. That business has dried up, and the family gets food parcels from the government twice a month.
The only regular outside time Tresor has is in a small courtyard next to his home.
“The day becomes long,” he says in his native tongue, Kinyarwanda. “(You) can’t go out there” — he indicates the world outside his house — “and it makes me feel really uncomfortable.”
Tresor draws a picture of the future that shows soldiers shooting civilians who are protesting, he says. He adds dabs of red paint next to one of those who has fallen.
“There is blood,” he says, “and some are crying, as you can see.”
It’s a stark image for a boy to produce. Rwanda was the first country in Africa to enforce a total lockdown because of the virus. It’s also a place where the security forces meant to be helping keep people safe have been accused of serious abuses of power.
Yet he wants to be a soldier.
Jacqueline says her son is a good student — “so intelligent.” She struggles to reconcile his own desire to join the military with the picture he has drawn.

JEIMMER ALEJANDRO RIVEROS, 9, COLOMBIA
Life in Colombia’s countryside has become even more difficult for the family of Jeimmer Alejandro Riveros.
The price of herbs and vegetables his single mom and siblings cultivate on a farm in Chipaque have declined. A spotty internet connection makes virtual classes difficult, and a nationwide quarantine means less time outdoors.
“Here is a mountain with a river,” Jeimmer, 9, says, pointing at each item in his drawing. In his mind, the future doesn’t look so different. “Here I am. Here’s my mommy. Here is my brother. Here is my house. Here is the sun and here is the sky.”
The family recently launched a YouTube channel with videos showing how to grow and propagate plants that now has more than 420,000 followers. Their first video, introducing the Jeimmer’s mom, older brother and dog, has garnered, by now, more than 1 million views.
“Let’s make this go viral!” Jeimmer says, as birds chirp in the background.
Colombia is one of Latin America’s most unequal countries, and poverty abounds in rural areas where many still lack basic utilities like safe drinking water. Jeimmer’s family often walks 40 minutes a day to get fresh milk.
Capital city Bogota — about an hour from the family’s farm — has the highest number of coronavirus cases in Colombia. But cases are increasingly being identified in rural areas with few hospitals. Chipaque reported its first case earlier this month.
Despite the obstacles, Jeimmer maintains an upbeat outlook on life under quarantine. He feels safe from the virus with his mom and brother. And he imagines a future with more time spent outdoors and one day, a grown-up job.
“It doesn’t matter that we’re in lockdown,” he says. “We can be happy.”

ISHIKIIHARA E-KOR, 11, UNITED STATES
Ishikiihara E-kor misses all the normal kid things during the pandemic: playing baseball, hanging out with friends and having a real party for his 11th birthday, which he instead celebrated with relatives on a Zoom call. The internet periodically goes out for hours, making it hard for him to complete his school work, so he plays with his dog, Navi Noop Noop.
But Shikii, as his friends call him, also has bigger things on his mind. He’s a Karuk Indian, a member of California’s second-largest tribe, and has been reading about how the pandemic is rampaging through the Navajo Nation, another tribe hundreds of miles away.
The virus can feel far away in the tribe’s tiny outpost of Orleans, California, where the crystal clear lower Klamath River winds through densely forested mountains south of the Oregon-California border. But in a rap Shikii wrote, he urged fellow tribal members not to get complacent.
“Stay away, man, 6 feet at least. Social distancing, it’s a thing that could save us. What? Like 5,000 of us left, Karuk tribe, man, that’s it.”
Ishikiihara, whose full name means “sturgeon warrior” in the Karuk language, later adds, “If we even just lost a few people, that would be really sad.""
Rapping about his worries isn’t new for him. He has a song about how his tribe lost its tradition fishing salmon runs on the Klamath River, pondering in verse why the Karuk “needed permission to go fishin’.”

BANEEN AHMED, 10, JORDAN
Despite the harshness she has experienced, the quiet, studious girl is brimming with hard-won optimism.
Her family’s suffering in war-time Iraq has taught Baneen Ahmed that outside events can turn life upside down in an instant. In the chaotic aftermath of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, an uncle was kidnapped, and a great-uncle was killed by armed militias, forcing her family to seek refuge in Jordan.
By comparison, the coronavirus pandemic seems manageable, the 10-year-old says. Scientists will find a vaccine, she says, speaking in halting but vocabulary-rich English, her favorite subject of study at a private school in the Jordanian capital of Amman.
“It’s going to take a year or a little bit to find a cure, so it’s going to end,” says Baneen, who prefers to talk and show how she’s studying at home under lockdown, rather than drawing a picture.
“In Iraq, it’s not going to end,” she continues. “It’s like so hard to end it, the killing and the kidnapping.”
In the future, she sees herself studying abroad, maybe in the United States or Turkey. She’s thought about a career in medicine, but is excited by any opportunity to learn. For her, school represents hope.
“I want to go somewhere else because they will let us study good things,” Baneen says. “And my future is going to be good.”

ELENA MORETTI, 11, ITALY
For Elena Moretti, the pandemic is not some faraway threat. Italy was the first European country to be hit by COVID-19, and her mother is a doctor in the public health system that has seen 27,500 personnel infected and more than 160 doctors dead nationwide.
Elena, 11, is afraid of the coronavirus. Whenever a package arrives in the mail, she brings it out onto the terrace and disinfects it with a spray-bottle soap solution she made herself.
It's a bottle, too, in Elena's drawing, capturing the virus inside.
“The virus wanted to attack us, so instead of bringing us down, we counterattack and imprison it,” she said of her drawing.
That fighting spirit has helped Elena get through more than two months of lockdown. After an initial spell of sleeping late because her teachers hadn’t transitioned to remote learning, Elena now does schoolwork, karate and hip-hop lessons online.
Sometimes the internet connection goes out. But she’s still managed to keep in touch with friends, with some video chats lasting for hours. She’s also discovered a new hobby, baking sweets — apple tort, cupcakes and cream-filled pastry.
Now that Italy’s lockdown has begun to ease, Elena is starting to go out again, but the fear remains.
“I’m afraid it might spread even more and take all of us,” she said.

NIKI JOLENE BERGHAMRE-DAVIS, 11, AUSTRALIA
When she doesn’t move enough, she doesn’t sleep well. So, Niki Jolene Berghamre-Davis tries to go hiking in the forest whenever possible during this global pandemic. Even in the best of times, that’s where the 11-year-old from Port Melbourne, Australia, feels most at home.
“She is our nature girl,” says her mother, Anna Berghamre.
Her mom wasn’t surprised when Niki Jolene drew a self-portrait of herself facing a grove of trees. Within the drawing, there are signs of caution.
“I have a face mask in my hand,” she says holding up the drawing, “because, well, I’ve just kind of taken it off, and I’m still aware.”
She says that falling leaves she included in the sketch symbolize the lives that have been lost in this pandemic.
Yet the roots of the trees — wide and prominent like those of the flowering red gum trees near her family’s townhome — represent “possibilities,” says the bubbly girl, known as “Snickers” to some of her friends. She smiles often, showing a full set of braces on her teeth.
“After this corona pandemic, after this will end, I think it will be much more full of life,” she says, throwing her arms up for emphasis. She hopes, for instance, that people will walk more and drive less because she’s noticed how people in her neighborhood have often done without their cars during the shutdown.
“I think people won’t take things for granted anymore.”

DANYLO BOICHUK, 12, UKRAINE
Danylo Boichuk envies his cat, Kari, who is able to escape from the family home in a Kyiv suburb and run free. Because of the pandemic, his family had to cancel a summer camp in Bulgaria, and 12-year-old Danylo worries a lot about closed borders.
Sitting on his back porch, he has used his LEGO blocks and figures to create his version of the future — a situation at the border.
“Here is a vessel en route to Copenhagen, and border guards are inspecting it,” Danylo explains, pointing to particular pieces and holding up others. “This crew member shows medical evidence that everyone on board is healthy, except for one man in an isolation cell.”
The plastic figure makes a rattling sound after he drops it into the makeshift jail.
“There is a security guard restricting contact with the man,” he continues. “There are IT specialists at work. There are also people who lost their jobs — musicians, farmers, showmen.”
The boy wonders if authorities in some countries will use the coronavirus crisis to tighten their grip on people’s lives. “For example, they may implant chips to track (people’s) whereabouts … ,” Danylo surmises.
His parents say he has an analytical mind. Already, he wants to become a businessman in the future and create a start-up to develop online games. He’s been reading books about Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, and other famous entrepreneurs, during self-isolation.
After the pandemic, he says people will invest more in internet products and games.
“This is an opportunity one should use,” he says.

ANA LAURA RAMÍREZ LAVANDERO, 10, CUBA
Her drawing depicts a simple enough dream for a 10-year-old — “Viaje a la Playa,” a trip to the beach. On the page, she has colored a palm tree with three brown coconuts, a boat floating in the distance and a shining yellow sun.
It is a scene representative of life on her island country, known for its white sand and aqua-blue waters. For now, however, Ana Laura Ramírez Lavandero can only dream of the beach. Under lockdown, she finds herself confined to the fourth-floor apartment she shares with her parents and grandmother. On the balcony, she watches life through a rusted iron trellis. It can seem like a jail.
“My life changed,” says the girl, who’s accustomed to playing on the streets of her working and middle-income neighborhood in Havana.
The only time she’s been able to go out in nearly two months has been for an emergency trip to the dentist. Schools are closed, and because many people in Cuba don’t have internet, the education ministry is broadcasting lessons on state television.
Ana Laura dreams of becoming a famous drummer. This was her first year at a highly selective institute for students identified early on as musically talented. She is continuing with classes in math, history and Spanish, but not music.
Her children’s chorus also can’t meet right now. Usually, her own choir meets alongside another one, with boys and girls of all ages.
“People feel united in the chorus,” she says wistfully. She can’t wait to see them again.

SANWERIA BROTHERS, 8 AND 9, INDIA
Advait Vallabh Sanweria, age 9, grins as his younger brother lists all the things they’ve been doing during India’s extended shutdown.
“We get spanked, scolded, watch movies, cook, sweep floors and use the phone and make Skype calls,” Uddhav Pratap Sanweria, age 8, says in Hindi.
At times the brothers are a bit of a comedy routine, or at least a danger to the furniture in their home. They’ve turned one room into a cricket pitch, with one brother bowling, or pitching, the ball, while the other bats. Other times, they play quieter games, such as chess or Uno.
Excited at first about school shutting down indefinitely, the brothers missed being able to go outside.
“It is frustrating to stay locked inside our homes,” Advait Vallabh, the 9-year-old says of the lockdown, which have since eased a little. “When I get frustrated, sometimes I read a book. Sometimes I cry.”
Recently, the brothers were excited to see a rainbow arching across blue skies outside their home.
“The weather has changed so much,” says Advait Vallabh, noting the visibly fresh air in New Delhi, as pollution in the otherwise choked city has cleared drastically during the lockdown.
Even with the ups and downs, the brothers believe the lockdown should continue for a year.
“They shouldn’t reopen until the time there are zero cases left,” the younger Uddhav Pratap says.

OWEN WATSON, 12, CANADA
Dressed in a puffy parka made by his mom and with cellphone in hand, Owen Watson gives a tour of his town, Iqaluit, in the far-north Canadian territory of Nunavut. There’s still snow on the ground in May, though the days are getting longer in this place known for its spectacular views of the northern lights.
“That light blue place is the school that I used to go to,” 12-year-old Owen says of the shuttered structure behind him. Then he turns to a playground. “It’s not supposed to be played with right now.”
Surrounded by rivers, lakes and the ocean, filled with Arctic char, his dad, Aaron Watson, says the name of their town means “fishes” in Inuktitut, the language spoken by this region's Inuit people, which includes Owen and his mom and sister. Dad is originally from Stratford, Ontario, and works in the tourism industry in Nunavut.

WASHINGTON (AP) — By the time President Donald Trump first spoke publicly about the coronavirus, it may already have been too late.
Interviewed at Davos, a gathering of global elites in the Swiss Alps, the president on Jan. 22 played down the threat posed by the respiratory virus from China, which had just reached American shores in the form of a solitary patient in Washington state.
“We have it totally under control,” Trump said on CNBC. “It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.”
In the 11 weeks since that interview, the coronavirus has reached every corner of the globe. It has infected more than 500,000 Americans and killed at least 20,000. It has rewritten the rules of society, isolated people in their homes, closed schools, devastated the economy and put millions out of work.
When Trump spoke in Switzerland, weeks’ worth of warning signs already had been raised. In the ensuing month, before the president first addressed the crisis from the White House, key steps to prepare the nation for the coming pandemic were not taken.
Life-saving medical equipment was not stockpiled. Travel largely continued unabated. Vital public health data from China was not provided or was deemed untrustworthy. A White House riven by rivalries and turnover was slow to act. Urgent warnings were ignored by a president consumed by his impeachment trial and intent on protecting a robust economy that he viewed as central to his reelection chances.
Twenty current and former administration officials and Republicans close to the White House were interviewed for this account about the critical weeks lost before the president spoke to the nation on Feb. 26. Most spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about private discussions.

‘MYSTERIOUS PNEUMONIA’
On New Year’s Eve, China informed the World Health Organization of a “mysterious pneumonia outbreak” spreading through Wuhan, an industrial city of 11 million.
The government closed a seafood market at the center of the outbreak, moved all patients with the virus to a specially designated hospital and collected test samples to send to government laboratories. Doctors were told to stay quiet; one who issued a warning online was punished. He later died of the virus.
The Pentagon first learned about the new coronavirus in December from open source reports emanating from China. By early January, warnings about the virus had made their way into intelligence reports circulating around the government. On Jan. 3, the head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Robert Redfield, received a call from his Chinese counterpart with an official warning.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, was alerted to the virus around the same time — and within two weeks was fearful it could bring global catastrophe.
Quickly, U.S. intelligence and public health officials began doubting China's reported rates of infection and death toll. They pressed China to allow in U.S. epidemiologists — both to assist the country in confronting the spread and to gain valuable insights that could help buy time for the U.S. response. U.S. officials also pressed China to send samples of the virus to U.S. labs for study and for vaccine and test development.
On Jan. 11, China shared the virus’ genetic sequence. That same day, the National Institutes of Health started working on a vaccine.
Ultimately, the U.S. was able to get China’s consent to send two people on the WHO team that traveled to China later in the month. But by then precious weeks had been lost and the virus had raced across Asia and had begun to escape the continent.
___
BALANCING ACT
For much of January, administration officials were doing a delicate balancing act.
Internally, they were raising alarms about the need to get Americans on the ground in China. Publicly, they were sending words of encouragement and praise in hopes Beijing would grant the Americans access.
Matthew Pottinger, Trump's deputy national security adviser, persistently urged more aggressive action in calling out China and sending teams there.
But while word of the virus was included in several of the president’s intelligence briefings, Trump wasn’t fully briefed on the threat until Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar called with an update on Jan. 18 while the president was at his private Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.
Trump spent much of the conversation wanting to talk about vaping; he was considering a new policy restricting its use. White House officials now believe Trump didn’t fully grasp the magnitude of the threat to the U.S. in part because Azar, who was feuding with several members of Trump’s inner circle, did a poor job communicating it.
Azar was trying to walk a fine line between Trump’s upbeat statements and preparing the government for what might lie ahead. “America’s risk is low at the moment,” he later told House lawmakers. “That could change quickly.”
Moreover, the president was in the middle of his Senate impeachment trial and focused on little else, punctuating nearly every White House meeting with complaints about the Democrats out to get him, grievances he would continue late into the night on the phone from his private quarters.
Trump also had little desire to pressure Beijing or criticize its president, Xi Jinping, with whom he wanted to secure cooperation on ending a yearlong trade war before the reelection campaign kicked into high gear. When Trump fielded his first question about the virus in Davos, he enthusiastically praised Xi’s response, going well beyond the calibrated risk-reward messaging his aides were encouraging.
___
INFIGHTING
The West Wing was adrift.
By late January, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney held the post in name only as rumors swirled of his impending, post-impeachment departure. He was on the initial coronavirus task force, which was plagued with infighting. At the same time, the White House Office of Management and Budget was clashing with Azar's HHS over money to combat the virus.
HHS wanted to send a special coronavirus funding request to Congress but the White House budget office resisted for weeks, insisting that HHS should instead repurpose $250 million of its existing budget to bolster the national stockpile by buying protective equipment. HHS, however, claimed that without congressional authorization it could not buy the needed quantities of masks, gowns and ventilators to rapidly bolster the national stockpile
Eventually, an initial request went to Congress for $2.5 billion in virus aid, an amount that lawmakers of both parties dismissed as too low. The bill that Congress quickly passed and Trump signed — the first of three so far — was for $8 billion.
Even as the two agencies fought, there was no influential voice in Trump’s orbit pushing him to act swiftly on the pandemic. Trump had surrounded himself with loyalists and few in the administration, including national security adviser Robert O'Brien, were able to redirect the president's attention. In mid-January, meetings were being held at the White House, but the focus was on getting U.S. government employees back from China, which was still playing down how contagious the virus was.
A Jan. 29 memo from senior White House aide Peter Navarro accurately predicted some of the challenges faced by the U.S. from what would become a pandemic, though he was hardly the first to sound the alarm. But he, like Pottinger, was viewed by others in the White House as a “China hawk” and their concerns were rejected by others in the administration who did not bring them to the president.
On Jan. 30, the WHO declared the virus a global health emergency while Trump held a packed campaign rally in Iowa. The next day, the Trump administration banned admittance to the United States by foreign nationals who had traveled to China in the past 14 days, excluding the immediate family members of American citizens or permanent residents.
Trump styled it as bold action, but continued to talk down the severity of the threat. Despite the ban, nearly 40,000 people have arrived in the United States on direct flights from China since that date, according to an analysis by The New York Times.
The White House denied that it was slow to act.
“While the media and Democrats refused to seriously acknowledge this virus in January and February,"" said spokesman Judd Deere. “President Trump took bold action to protect Americans and unleash the full power of the federal government to curb the spread of the virus, expand testing capacities, and expedite vaccine development when we had no true idea the level of transmission or asymptomatic spread.""
___
'VERY, VERY READY'
On Feb. 10, Trump stood before thousands of supporters packed into a New Hampshire rally and declared: “By April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away.""
The crowd roared its approval at Trump’s unproven assertion. The Senate had acquitted Trump on the impeachment charges and the president shifted his focus toward reelection even as others in the administration keyed in on the virus.
Federal officials put the CDC solely in charge of developing a test for the virus and left out private interests, a choice that cost precious time when the resulting CDC test proved faulty.
Trump spent many weeks shuffling responsibility for leading his administration’s response to the crisis. He put Azar in charge of the administration's virus task force before replacing him with Vice President Mike Pence toward the end of February. Even as the virus spread across the globe, prevailing voices in the White House, including senior adviser Jared Kushner and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, urged the president to avoid big steps that could roil financial markets.
The president had firmly linked his fate to Wall Street, and it took a tumble by the markets for Trump to ratchet up his response. In late February, while Trump was on a trip to India, the Dow Jones plummeted 1,000 points amid rising fears about the coronavirus.
Trump stewed about the collapse on his Feb. 26 flight back to Washington and lashed out at aides over comments made by a top CDC official, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, during a briefing the prior day, when she warned Americans that they would have to prepare for fairly severe social distancing.
“It’s not so much of a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen,” she said.
The White House announced that Pence would brief the media about the response that night. But Trump took the podium instead and has not relinquished the stage much since, belatedly making himself the face of the battle against the virus.
When Trump first took the lectern in the White House briefing room to speak about the virus, the U.S. had 15 coronavirus patients.
“We’re at that very low level, and we want to keep it that way,"" Trump said. “We’re very, very ready for this.""

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A federal judge Friday night ruled that Tennessee has to continue allowing abortions amid a temporary ban on nonessential medical procedures that's aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19.
U.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman said the defendants didn't show that any appreciable amount of personal protective equipment, or PPE, would be saved if the ban is applied to abortions.
In a hearing by phone Friday, attorneys representing several state abortion clinics argued that Tennessee women will face immediate harm if the ban on abortions is not lifted.
Alex Rieger, arguing for the Tennessee attorney general's office, said abortions are not being singled out but treated like any other procedure that is not necessary to prevent death or serious bodily injury. Gov. Bill Lee issued an emergency order on April 8 banning those procedures for three weeks.
The goal of the ban is to preserve the limited supply of PPE for doctors fighting COVID-19 and to help prevent the community spread of the disease by limiting patient-provider interactions, Rieger said. The two sides tangled over whether halting abortions would meet or undermine that goal.
Several other states are grappling with similar issues. Judges in the past week have ruled to allow abortions to continue in Arkansas, Oklahoma, Ohio and Texas.
Genevieve Scott, an attorney with the Center for Reproductive Rights, argued that all pregnant women need care. About 1 in 5 pregnant women require hospital visits before labor, and 15-20% of pregnancies end in miscarriages. Even those women without problems require prenatal care and tests. All of that requires providers to use personal protective equipment and interact with patients, Scott said.
Rieger argued that most of what Scott described would take place a couple of months down the road and that ""every piece of PPE we use now is a piece that is not available when this disease reaches its peak.”
Scott disputed that idea, saying the needs are immediate. She also noted that there is no guarantee the executive order will not be extended.
“Nothing in their arguments today suggests they really believe that in three weeks the issue will be resolved,” she said.
Abortion clinics have already turned away dozens of patients, Scott said. The longer an abortion is delayed, the greater chance of complications, she said. And the delay could prevent some woman from having an abortion altogether by pushing them past 20 weeks gestation, after which abortions generally are not available in Tennessee.
Rieger asserted that Tennessee has the power to restrict abortions in a public health emergency, citing a 1905 U.S. Supreme Court case in which the court held that requiring citizens to be vaccinated for smallpox was a legitimate exercise of the state’s police powers to protect the health and safety of its citizens.
He suggested abortion providers don't want to play by the rules that everyone else has to abide by.
“They want abortion to carry on in Tennessee as if COVID had never happened,” Rieger said. “Tennesseans are making extraordinary sacrifices. Abortion providers don't want to sacrifice.”
Scott argued that abortion has been recognized as a constitutional right. And she said medical groups, including the College of Surgeons, which the state relied upon in crafting its executive order, recognize that abortion is essential care that should not be delayed.
“The state is singling out abortion as the only essential care excluded by the executive order,” she said.
Tennessee's Republican governor often speaks of his Christian faith and has said he wants to enact some of the strictest abortion laws in the nation, including banning women from undergoing the procedure once a fetal heartbeat is detected.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is set to name a former pharmaceutical executive to lead his administration's all-out effort to produce and distribute a coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year.
Moncef Slaoui, a former GlaxoSmithKline executive, will lead “Operation Warp Speed,” Trump's push to accelerate the vaccine development process for COVID-19, according to an administration official. Slaoui is to serve in a volunteer capacity, and will be assisted by Army Gen. Gustave Perna, the commander of United States Army Materiel Command.
The move comes as the president and White House aides hope to produce vaccines for the coronavirus faster than what many scientists believe is realistic. The administration is aiming to have 300 million doses to distribute to Americans by the end of the year, believing a reliable vaccine is the only way to promote an economic rebound.
“Operation Warp Speed” is operating largely independently of the existing White House coronavirus task force, which is also shifting its focus toward vaccine development.
The initiative is being promoted by White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, and involves officials from the Defense Department and the Department of Health and Human Services.
On Tuesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, said a vaccine would not be available by the beginning of the next academic year.
“The idea of having treatments available or a vaccine to facilitate re-entry of students into the fall term would be something that would be a bit of a bridge too far,” he said, “even at the top speed we’re going.”

FINANCIAL MARKETS
Stocks rise as traders see hopeful signs on opening economy
NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks are moving higher on Wall Street as traders embrace early signs that the White House and a number of state governors are considering how to gradually reopen the economy. Big companies also started reporting their first-quarter earnings, giving investors an early peek into how the coronavirus outbreak was affecting their business.
Technology and health care stocks powered much of the broad rally. Johnson & Johnson rose after beating earnings estimates, even though the health care giant also had to slash its outlook.
European markets were mostly higher after reopening following a holiday. Asian markets ended mostly higher. Bond prices rose. Oil prices fell.
IMF-GLOBAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
IMF: Global economy will suffer worst year since Depression
WASHINGTON (AP) — The International Monetary Fund says the world economy in 2020 will suffer its worst year since the Great Depression of the 1930s because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The IMF expects the global economy to shrink 3% this year before rebounding in 2021 with 5.8% growth. However, it cautions that prospects for a rebound next year are clouded by uncertainty.
The IMF's assessment represents a breathtaking downgrade. In its previous forecast in January, before COVID-19 emerged as a grave threat, it had forecast moderate global growth of 3.3% this year. But measures to contain the pandemic have suddenly brought economic activity to a near-standstill across much of the world.
EARNS-WELLS FARGO
Wells Fargo takes 1Q earnings, revenue hit from virus
NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo's profits plunged nearly 90% in the first quarter as the bank had to set aside billions of dollars to cover potentially bad loans due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The company said Tuesday that it boosted its loan loss provisions — or the money set aside to cover potentially bad loans — to $3.83 billion from $845 million a year ago as borrowers face the possibility of going broke because the coronavirus has effectively shut down the U.S. economy and others around the world.
Wells reported first-quarter earnings of $653 million, or 1 cent per share, down 89% from a $5.9 billion profit in last year's first quarter. The San Francisco-based bank said it had revenue of $17.1 billion in the quarter, down from $21.6 billion for the same period in 2019. The numbers fell well short of Wall Street expectations.
Like its competitors, Wells' interest income declined as the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate to near zero because of the virus outbreak. Wells reported interest income of $11.3 billion for the quarter, down nearly $1 billion from 2019's first quarter.
EARNS-JPMORGAN
JPMorgan 1Q profit drops 70% as it readies for loan defaults
NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase said Tuesday that its first-quarter profit plunged nearly 70%, as the bank was forced to set aside billions of dollars to cover potential losses tied to the coronavirus pandemic.
The New York-based bank put $8.29 billion in reserve to cover potentially bad loans, up from $1.5 billion last year. JPMorgan Chase is facing billions of dollars in losses shut down businesses across the country and put millions of Americans out of work, as borrowers who were in fine shape just weeks ago — ranging from individuals with credit cards to oil and gas companies — are now at risk of running out of money and defaulting on loans.
The last time JPMorgan had to set aside that amount of money to cover potentially bad loans was the first quarter of 2009 — in the depths of the Great Recession.
Chase, the nation’s largest bank by assets, is among the first of the major U.S. companies to describe the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Its profit fell to $2.87 billion from $9.18 billion in the same period a year earlier. Wells Fargo, the nation's largest mortgage lender, said profit fell 95% as it boosted bad loan reserves by $3.1 billion.
JPMorgan is one of the nation’s largest credit card issuers. Millions of Americans who lost their jobs are now at risk of defaulting on their credit card accounts.
JOHNSON & JOHNSON-RESULTS
J&J slashes outlook, races to develop coronavirus vaccine
UNDATED (AP) — Johnson & Johnson has slashed its 2020 sales forecast by billions of dollars and cut its profit expectations by about 15%, anticipating significant impact from the COVID-19 pandemic,
It's one of the first major U.S. corporations to report first-quarter earnings and likely a harbinger of things to come as the outbreak disrupts the global economy.
The world’s biggest health products maker on Tuesday said it now expects 2020 revenue of $77.5 billion to $80.5 billion, down from its January forecast of $85.4 billion to $86.2 billion. It also forecast adjusted earnings per share of $7.50 to $7.90, down from the January forecast of $9 to $9.15 per share.
Despite that, the company increased its quarterly stock dividend, for the 58th consecutive year, from 95 cents to $1.01 per share.
Investors seemed reassured, driving shares higher.
VIRUS OUTBREAK-DAIRY
Virus sours business for already-reeling dairy industry
MARSHFIELD, Vt. (AP) — This was supposed to be rebound year for dairy farmers embattled by at least four years of depressed milk prices — and then the coronavirus hit.
Schools, restaurants, institutions and universities closed to help slow the spread of the virus, wiping out much of the food service market that makes up for a big chunk of dairy farmers' business. Now farmers and cooperatives from Florida to Wisconsin to Maine are dumping milk because there are no plants that will take it and the price paid to farmers has collapsed again.
Plants set up to make food service products — like large packages of mozzarella cheese — aren’t able to pivot quickly and start churning out gallons of milk. Retail milk sales were up when the virus first hit as consumers bulked up on groceries but have declined since then.
In the past five years, about 5,000 dairy farms have gone out of business across the country, and the ramifications of the virus outbreak will drive more to the brink, according to Cornell University agricultural economist Andrew Novakovic.
VIRUS OUTBREAK-FRANCE-AMAZON
French court orders Amazon to suspend non-essential sales
PARIS (AP) — A French court has ordered Amazon to stop selling non-essential goods for the next month to protect its employees from the virus. The emergency ruling Tuesday requires Amazon to evaluate health risks at all its facilities nationwide and negotiate new safety measures with worker representatives. That's according to lawyers for unions that launched the legal proceedings. Sales of food, medicine and hygiene supplies are still allowed. Unions hailed the ruling, while Amazon did not immediately comment. The head of Amazon France has said that the company was doing everything it could to put in place safety measures.
GERMANY-ADIDAS-RESCUE LOAN
Adidas cleared for 3 billion euros in rescue loans
FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Sports gear and shoe company Adidas has been approved for a 3 billion-euro rescue loan by the German government. That amounts to $3.3 billion. The state owned development bank would contribute most of the loan and partner banks would come up with the rest. It's to keep the company going during the interruption due to the virus outbreak. Adidas, which is headquartered in Germany, says that as a condition of getting the money it is cancelling executive bonuses for this year. It also means no share buybacks or dividends. The company says that the impact of the virus has been so devastating that it cannot give any outlook for how its business will do this year.
FIAT CHRYSLER RECALL
Fiat Chrysler recalls pickups, SUVs to fix windshield wipers
DETROIT (AP) — Fiat Chrysler is recalling more than 550,000 pickup trucks and SUVs worldwide because the windshield wiper arms can come loose and stop the wipers from working properly.
The recall covers certain 2019 and 2020 Ram 1500 pickups, 1500 Classic pickups and Jeep Compass SUVs. Documents posted Tuesday by the U.S. government's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration say loose wiper arms can reduce a driver's visibility.
Fiat Chrysler says in a statement that it has no reports of crashes or injuries from the problem. Most of the recalled vehicles are in the U.S. and Canada.
Owners will be notified later this month and dealers will tighten the wiper nuts to fix the problem.

VIRUS OUTBREAK-SPORTS
Sports leagues seek return to play but with no guarantees
UNDATED (AP) — Sports fans hoping for a fast return to the games they love might need to temper their expectations. Although sports leagues talk publicly about their desire to return to competition before summer, those are best-case scenarios.
Behind closed doors, they are hatching different potential plans: all 30 baseball teams playing in Arizona; home run contests to decide tie games; the Stanley Cup being hoisted in an empty arena that neither team calls home; end-of-season soccer standings decided by vote; college football games in spring.
Over the past week, The Associated Press interviewed more than 20 policymakers, coaches and players across the globe for their assessments of the situation. They all conceded that sports may not restart for months, if at all this year. Most agree that what's needed is a drastic ramp-up in testing, a vaccine or some type of improved treatment to make players feel safe to compete.
Dr. Anthony Fauci (FOW’-chee), the infectious disease expert, has suggested that sports could conceivably return with no fans in arenas and constant testing for the players, who would likely need to be quarantined in hotels for weeks or months. Not all players are on board.
In other developments related to the coronavirus pandemic:
— Wayne Gretzky is optimistic the NHL will be able to resume at some point this summer. He tells The Associated Press he’s hopeful hockey and other sports will be able to come back from the coronavirus pandemic and serve as a sign that conditions are improving. Gretzky says he believes leaders in the U.S. and Canada will find a way to bring back hockey and other sports in June, July and August. The league is considering several options on trying to resume this season, including going directly to the playoffs at several neutral sites.
— Soccer has resumed in Turkmenistan with spectators as the Central Asian nation lifted a suspension of its national league. Around 500 people attended Sunday’s game in a 20,000-capacity stadium in the capital. The crowd size was broadly in line with typical domestic league games in Turkmenistan and as usual attendance was free. The game ended 1-1. The eight-team league was suspended on March 24 amid the coronavirus pandemic. Turkmenistan is one of the few countries in the world not to have reported any cases of the coronavirus.
— The stadium of English Premier League club Brighton has been converted into the south coast’s biggest drive-in coronavirus testing center. The appointment-only center has been put in place at the American Express Community Stadium as part of the drive to increase testing for National Health Service staff and other key workers. Officials say the center was scheduled to see more than 50 NHS frontline workers on Saturday, and they’ll have the results of their tests within 48 hours. Within a few days, the site should reach its capacity of up to 1,000 tests a day.
— Players and coaches for Italian soccer team Roma have waived their salary for four months. The team hasn’t played a competitive match since March 1 because of the pandemic, so the players and coaching staff will forgo salaries due to them for March, April, May and June.
— British horse racing’s most successful flat trainer of all time is recovering after contracting the coronavirus. Mark Johnston has been isolating since having the symptoms confirmed and his family says he is making good progress. In 2018, Johnston celebrated his 4,194th winner, which is the most of any trainer in British flat racing.
— A Japanese professor of infectious disease says he is “very pessimistic” the postponed Tokyo Olympics can open in 15 months. Kentaro Iwata of Kobe University says, “To be honest with you, I don’t think the Olympics is likely to be held next year.” The CEO of the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee expressed similar reservations 10 days ago. Since then, the organizing committee and the International Olympic Committee have said there is no ""Plan B'' other than working for the Olympics to open on July 23, 2021.
— Australia’s top rugby players will demand a greater say in the future of the sport after agreeing to pay cuts designed to allow the game to weather the financial fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. Some players reportedly will give up as much as 60 percent of their income in the short term as Australian rugby faces uncertainty with major competitions shut down, perhaps for the rest of the year.
NBA-BOGUT FUTURE
Former NBA top pick Bogut unsure about playing future
UNDATED (AP) — Andrew Bogut (BOH'-gut) is close to making a decision on when to end his career after 15 years in professional basketball.
Bogut was planning to retire after playing for Australia at the Tokyo Games this summer. With those games delayed until July 2021, the 35-year-old is debating whether to wait it out. He says he probably needs to decide by mid-May.
Bogut was a 2005 No. 1 draft pick by Milwaukee and won an NBA championship with the Golden State Warriors in 2015. He has played for Sydney in the National Basketball League the past two seasons.
NASCAR-VIRTUAL RACING
Byron makes it 2 straight wins
CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — William Byron won his second consecutive NASCAR virtual race by holding off Timmy Hill in a drama-free event at virtual Richmond Raceway.
The most excitement came when Matt DiBenedetto was parked for intentionally crashing Ryan Preece and the two then engaged in a Twitter spat. The iRacing Series has had a sour taste since Bubba Wallace lost a sponsor for quitting a game in a rage and Kyle Larson was fired for using a racial slur.
FORMULA1-VIRTUAL RACING

VIRUS OUTBREAK-NEW YORK
Cuomo: Feds must help with testing. Trump: Stop complaining
NEW YORK (AP) — Gov. Andrew Cuomo and President Donald Trump have once again tussled publicly, this time over wide-scale coronavirus testing. The Democratic governor said Friday that the federal government was doing too little to help states reopen their outbreak-stricken economies by making sure they can perform mass diagnostic testing. The Republican president responded on Twitter that the federal government came through on ventilators and thousands of hospital beds for New York, yet Cuomo seemed ungrateful. Friday’s flare-up of their rivarly played out during one of Cuomo’s widely watched briefings. A reporter read Trump’s tweets to Cuomo, and the governor responded with his own barbs.
BC-VIRUS OUTBREAK-THE LATEST
The Latest: Japan passes 10K cases; Abe stresses distancing
Japan had 556 new cases of the coronavirus, bringing a national total to 9,795, the country’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare said Saturday. With an addition of 712 others from a cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo earlier this year, Japan now has 10,507 cases. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe expanded his April 7 state of emergency to all of Japan on Thursday. He is concerned that people are not observing the government-requested social distancing as much as they should.
VIRUS OUTBREAK-PORK PLANTS
Officials implore Tyson to close plant amid virus outbreak
DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — More than a dozen Iowa elected officials implored Tyson Fresh Meats to close their Waterloo pork processing plant, saying the coronavirus is spreading among workers and is endangering not only employees of the plant but the entire community. Mayors, county officials and state legislators signed the letter that was sent to Tyson on Thursday. The 19 officials said at a Friday news conference they had only received confirmation from the company that it had received the letter but no other action .The officials also accused Gov. Kim Reynolds of misleading Iowans on the seriousness of the outbreak and for failure to take action to close the plant.
AP-VIRUS OUTBREAK-REOPENING WORSHIP
Trump consults faith leaders on phased-in reopening
NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump is bringing faith leaders into a discussion about a phased-in return to broader in-person worship after weeks of religious services largely shifting online in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Trump held a call with faith leaders one day after his White House included houses of worship among “large venues” that could be able to reopen while observing “strict physical distancing protocols” in the first stage of a three-part plan to reopen the U.S. economy, which has been frozen by the toll of the highly contagious virus.
VIRUS OUTBREAK-MICHAEL COHEN
Ex-Trump lawyer Cohen to serve out prison sentence at home
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s former lawyer and longtime fixer Michael Cohen will be released from federal prison to serve the remainder of his sentence in home confinement because of the coronavirus pandemic. That’s according to a Justice Department official and another person familiar with the matter. Cohen is locked up at FCI Otisville in New York. He pleaded guilty to numerous charges, including campaign finance fraud and lying to Congress. He’ll remain under quarantine for 14 days before he is released. Federal statistics show 14 inmates and seven staff members at the prison have tested positive for coronavirus.
AP-US-VIRUS-OUTBREAK-PROTESTS
Pro-Trump protesters push back on stay-at-home orders
A growing number of protests are being staged across the U.S. to oppose stay-at-home orders amid the coronavirus pandemic. In places like Oklahoma, Texas and Virginia, small-government groups, supporters of President Donald Trump, anti-vaccine advocates and others have united behind a deep suspicion of efforts to shut down daily life to slow the spread of the coronavirus. As their frustration grows, they’ve started to openly defy the social distancing rules to put pressure on governors to ease them. Some of the protests have been small events, promoted via recently created Facebook groups. Others are backed by groups with ties to Trump.
VIRUS OUTBREAK-TESTING TROUBLES
No plan in sight: Test troubles cloud Trump recovery effort
WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States is struggling to test enough people for the novel coronavirus so officials can track and control the spread of the disease. That's a crucial first step to reopening parts of the economy, as President Donald Trump is pushing to do by May 1. Trump's plan hinges on a downward trajectory of positive tests. It's been more than a month since he said ""anybody who wants a test, can get a test.” Today, the reality on the ground is much different. People report being unable to get tested, and health workers say supply shortages make more testing impossible.

Senator tells VP failed virus testing is 'dereliction'
WASHINGTON (AP) — Frustration boiled over into anger as Democratic senators pressed Vice President Mike Pence on coronavirus testing during a private conference call Friday. Maine Sen. Angus King told Pence the administration’s failure to develop an adequate national testing regime is a “dereliction of duty,” according to a person who joined the call but was unauthorized to discuss it and granted anonymity. King, an independent, told administration officials he has “never been so mad about a phone call in my life."" The criticism comes as Republicans say they are willing to accept Democratic demands for additional federal funding for hospitals to break a stalemate over the administration’s $250 billion request for a small-business payroll program that's run out of money. Talk continue this weekend.
ABSENTEE BALLOTS-WITNESS REQUIREMENT
Virginia sued over witness requirement for absentee ballots
RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — The American Civil Liberties Union is asking a federal court to block Virginia election officials from requiring that absentee voters find a witness to watch them sign their ballots during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ACLU filed a lawsuit on behalf of three voters and the League of Women Voters. The lawsuit says the witness requirement could cause “massive disenfranchisement” of Virginia voters. Under state law, any voter who submits an absentee ballot by mail must open the envelope containing the ballot in front of another person, fill out the ballot and then ask the witness to sign the outside of the ballot envelope before it is mailed.
VIRUS OUTBREAK-DEPORTEES
Scant testing in US migration system risks spreading virus
GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — Migrants' advocates are warning that the Trump administration’s failure to test all but a small percentage of detained immigrants for the novel coronavirus may be spreading the disease through the United States’ sprawling system of detention centers and then to Central America and elswhere aboard regular deportation flights. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has confirmed 105 cases of the virus in at least 25 separate detention facilities, along with at least 25 employees. In Guatemala, fears are rising that the flights may have seeded the country with an untold number of undetected cases. Several cases of local infection are already believed to be linked to deportees.

BERLIN (AP) — Derided by many economists for years for insisting on a balanced budget and criticized for a health care system seen as bloated and overly expensive, Germany has found itself well equipped now to weather the coronavirus pandemic.
Already applauded for early actions such as social-distancing regulations and aggressive testing seen as helping keep the death toll comparatively low, Europe’s largest economy has had the financial flexibility to launch a massive rescue plan to help businesses and keep workers paid.
As the country moves to relax some restrictions this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel is pointing to the example of South Korea, which relied on its experience fighting a different coronavirus five years ago to combat COVID-19, as the way forward.
Meantime in the U.S., some protesters have taken to the streets — supported by President Donald Trump's tweets — to demand an end to virus-related shutdowns to help the faltering economy, which has caused tens of millions to lose their jobs, even if it could lead to an increase in deaths as the health care system struggles.
“This is a crisis which, on the one hand, has probably hit the U.S. where it is most vulnerable, namely health care,” said Carsten Brzeski, ING bank’s chief Eurozone economist. “While at the same time it has hit the German economy where it’s the strongest.”
Brzeski was among those who argued for Germany to spend more to stimulate the economy as growth ground toward stagnation, but concedes now the country is in a fortunate position.
For years, balanced budget proponents argued it was prudent during good economic times to bring Germany’s house in order to be prepared for a crisis. So in announcing a 1 trillion euro ($1.1 trillion) rescue plan for the country’s 83 million people last month, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz was able to assure there was more money available, if needed.
And while Italy and Spain were faced at the height of the crisis with having to decide whether to allocate precious ICU beds to elderly patients with the most urgent need or to younger patients with the greatest chance of survival, Germany has never had a shortage and has even taken in patients from other European countries.
“They had the means, but then they also had the political will, and also the very good analytical insights to use the means,” Brzeski, said, noting Merkel was a scientist before entering politics.
“I can’t imagine any government better than Angela Merkel’s to deal with this.”
Germany is now taking baby steps to ease restrictions, allowing smaller shops to reopen this week while sticking to strict social-distancing guidelines and requiring face masks on public transport and in stores. The effect will be analyzed after two weeks to see whether infections have again started to significantly climb.
“We must not overwhelm our health care system,” Merkel said, warning restrictions could be snapped back. “The best path is one that is careful, and not taken light-heartedly.”
The far-right Alternative for Germany party has criticized Merkel’s go-slow approach as “ruining our country,” but the chancellor’s popularity has been steadily rising and Germans overwhelmingly see her government’s crisis management positively.
Opening her Berlin toy store Wednesday for the first time in over a month, Galina Hooge said she had already received government aid and the process was “surprisingly quick and uncomplicated.”
She said it only covered the store’s rent and bills, but she felt relatively secure thanks to Germany’s universal health insurance and strong social safety net.
“The main thing is that everyone stays healthy and the situation doesn’t become like America,” she said, referring to the large number of cases and deaths in the United States.
Besides help for small businesses, Germany's aid package is designed to keep the unemployment rate down and allow workers to return quickly when possible. While Washington is sending out one-time stimulus checks to Americans, the German government plan pays at least 60% of the salary of employees who are on reduced or no hours.
As restrictions are eased, Merkel has pointed to South Korea as an example of how Germany will have to improve measures to “get ahead” of the pandemic with more testing and tracking of cases to slow the infection rate.
Experts say one reason South Korea has managed to avoid lockdowns or business bans was because of its aggressive testing and contact-tracing program that draws from its experience of fighting a different coronavirus — MERS or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome -- in 2015.
Following that outbreak, which killed 36 people and sickened around 200, South Korea rewrote its infectious disease law to allow health authorities quick access to a broad range of personal information to fight infectious diseases.
Amid criticism from privacy advocates, authorities have fully exercised such powers during the COVID-19 pandemic, aggressively tracing virus carriers' contacts with tools such as smartphone GPS tracking, credit card records and surveillance video. People's movements before they were diagnosed are published on websites and relayed via smartphone alerts to inform others whether they have crossed paths with a carrier.
The government is also using smartphone tracking apps to monitor the tens of thousands of people placed under self-quarantine at home and plans to use electronic wristbands on people who defy quarantine orders.
South Korea on Wednesday reported 11 new cases of the coronavirus, the 21st day in a row that the daily jump in infections came below 100.
The approach has meant South Korea has managed to slow the spread of the virus without imposing massive lockdowns or banning nonessential businesses, so there has never been any debate over “reopening” its economy.
In the U.S., there has been growing impatience over virus-related shutdowns that have led tens of millions to lose their jobs, and the U.S. Senate on Tuesday approved nearly $500 billion in new aid for businesses, hospitals and testing, on top of a $2.2 trillion package passed last month in the country of some 328 million.
Trump’s administration has issued guidelines advising relaxation of restrictions only after prerequisites, like a two-week downward trajectory of cases, are met. Trump himself, however, has grumbled “our country wasn’t meant to be shut down” and has tweeted support for anti-shutdown protests, and some states are moving ahead with plans to begin reopening as early as this week.
The U.S. has registered more than 825,000 infections and 45,000 deaths so far, including some 15,000 fatalities in New York City alone. Often at odds with Trump, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has warned against relaxing restrictions too early and risking a new spike in infections, no matter how badly the economy is faring.
“We’re not going to accept a premise that human life is disposable,” Cuomo said. “And we’re not going to put a dollar figure on human life.”
Germany has registered some 150,000 infections, not far behind the worst-hit European countries of Italy, with more than 180,000 cases, and Spain with about 205,000. But where around 5,000 people have died in Germany, Spain’s toll is nearly 22,000 and Italy’s has passed 25,000.
At the height of the crisis in Spain and Italy the sheer numbers overwhelmed their health care systems, and painful decisions had to be made on who to treat.
Domenico Arcuri, Italy’s extraordinary commissioner for the COVID-19 crisis, told reporters Tuesday that for the first time during the pandemic the nation now has more respirators than patients in ICU beds, and lamented the “anguish” officials faced deciding who to treat in the early weeks.
“Each night, we had to decide where to send these instruments, which, in the end, save lives,” he said. “I’ll keep that with me for all my life, and I wouldn’t wish anyone else to experience” the dilemma of choosing which hospital received them.
With the numbers of new infections now stabilizing, Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte confirmed Tuesday that Italy can start reopening on May 4, but he doused any hopes of a total loosening of some of the strictest lockdown measures in a Western democracy.
Spain, which has turned hotels into makeshift hospitals and converted a Madrid skating rink into a morgue, has not yet announced plans on relaxing restrictions, with Health Minister Salvador Illa saying it will hinge on advances made in treatment and vaccines to “ensure there’s no second wave.”
Spain is “still in a difficult place, with some hard weeks ahead,” he said Tuesday.
In announcing a tentative easing of restrictions in the Netherlands, allowing elementary schools to reopen with reduced class sizes starting May 11, Prime Minister Mark Rutte said he had faced “devil’s dilemmas” in trying to decide how to move forward.
The Netherlands was projected to have a budget surplus of 3.4 billion euros in 2020, however, and Rutte said the government could afford to take a cautious approach as he ordered bars and restaurants to remain closed until at least May 19.
“Thanks to the government’s good financial position, it can offer first aid to companies, independent business owners and affected sectors,” his government said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — About 1.5 million laid-off workers applied for U.S. unemployment benefits last week, a historically high number, even as the economy increasingly reopens and employers bring some people back to work.
The latest figure from the Labor Department marked the 11th straight weekly decline in applications since they peaked at nearly 7 million in March as the coronavirus shut down much of the economy and caused tens of millions of layoffs. The decline was much smaller, though, than in recent weeks, falling just 58,000.
The total number of people receiving unemployment aid also fell slightly, reflecting the return of many to their old jobs.
The job market appears to have begun a slow recovery. In May, employers added 2.5 million jobs, an increase that suggested that the job market has bottomed out. The unemployment rate declined from 14.7% to a still-high 13.3%.
Even with the May hiring gain, nearly 21 million people are officially classified as unemployed. And including people the government said had been erroneously categorized as employed in May and those who lost jobs but didn’t look for new ones, 32.5 million people are out of work, economists estimate.
Thursday’s report also showed that an additional 760,000 people applied for jobless benefits last week under a new program for self-employed and gig workers that made them eligible for aid for the first time. These figures aren’t adjusted for seasonal variations, so the government doesn’t include them in the official count.
The steady decline in jobless claims follows some other encouraging reports that suggest that the lifting of shutdown orders has sparked some pent-up demand from consumers, whose spending largely drives the economy. Most economic gauges remain far below their pre-pandemic levels, though, and some analysts question whether the recent gains can be sustained, especially if the virus were to surge back.
Last month, retail and restaurant sales jumped nearly 18%, the government said Tuesday, retracing some of the record plunges of the previous two months. Even so, retail purchases remain a sizable 6% below their year-ago levels.
Furniture store sales nearly doubled, and clothing sales nearly tripled, though both remain far below their levels before the coronavirus struck. Clothing store sales are still down 60% compared with a year earlier.
Recently, some indicators have pointed to a stabilization, and in some areas a modest rebound, in economic activity.
–Jerome Powell, Federal Reserve chairman
With nearly record-low mortgage rates, applications for home loans reached an 11-year high last week. But even though the number of homes under construction rose in May, they remain substantially below last year’s pace.
The economy and the job market face a raft of uncertainties that could slow or even derail a recovery. Business re-openings have caused spikes of viral infections in nearly half of states, a trend that could lead consumers to pull back again on shopping and dining out and reverse any economic gains.
Restaurants, bars, gyms and movie theaters will likely rehire only a portion of their workforces. Many consumers won’t fully resume their previous habits of shopping, traveling and going out until a vaccine is available.
One key reason why consumer spending has rebounded is that government aid programs, from one-time $1,200 stimulus checks to $600-a-week in supplemental federal unemployment aid, have helped offset the loss of income for laid-off Americans. Yet nearly all the stimulus checks have been issued. And the supplemental federal jobless aid is set to expire July 31.
“Recently, some indicators have pointed to a stabilization, and in some areas a modest rebound, in economic activity,” Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Tuesday in testimony to a Senate committee. Yet “until the public is confident that the disease is contained, a full recovery is unlikely.”
Corinne Cook, who lives in Kissimmee, near Orlando, felt a huge relief to finally receive her unemployment benefits last week after a month and a half of battling Florida’s bureaucracy.
Cook, 28, had moved to the area in September for an 18-month contract position as a 3-D modeler for Walt Disney, a job involving sculpting character prototypes that were printed on 3-D printers. But she was laid off in mid-April after the parks closed down.
She is receiving the minimum state unemployment benefit from Florida, $125 a week, because the state has no record of her prior earnings in New Jersey, even though she said she has uploaded, mailed and faxed her documents from her job there. If her previous earnings were properly credited, her state benefits would more than double. She is grateful, though, for the extra $600 in federal unemployment benefits, which have allowed her to pay off some bills.
“It was very stressful,” she said. “I definitely lost it a few times.”
She is applying for a new job and hopes to stay in the area. But there aren’t a lot of open positions in her field.
“The future is very unknown at this point,” Cook said.
Other data paints a picture of an economy slowly on the mend. A weekly survey of small businesses by the Census Bureau found that in the week that ended June 6, nearly 10% of small firms said they were hiring. That’s double what it was five weeks ago. About 13% said they were still cutting jobs, less than half of what the figure was in late April.

JUBA, South Sudan (AP) — South Sudan has announced its first case of COVID-19, making it the 51st of Africa's 54 countries to report the disease.
A U.N. worker who arrived in the country from Netherlands on Feb. 28 is ill with the disease, confirmed First Vice President Riek Machar and the U.N. mission in South Sudan. The patient, a 29-year-old woman, first showed signs of the disease on April 2 and is recovering, said officials.
South Sudan, with 11 million people, currently has four ventilators and wants to increase that number, said Machar, who emphasized that people should stay three to six feet apart from others.
“The only vaccine is social distancing,” said Machar.
The patient is under quarantine at U.N. premises and health workers are tracing the people who had been in contact with her, said David Shearer, head of the U.N. operations in South Sudan.
He said he hoped the measures would contain the case.
To prevent the spread of the virus in South Sudan, President Salva Kiir last week imposed a curfew from 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. for six weeks and closed borders, airports, schools, churches and mosques.
For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, and the vast majority survive. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can be more severe, even causing pneumonia or death.
Recovering from a five-year civil war, South Sudan has several camps of thousands of displaced people. Across the border in Uganda is Bidibidi camp with with more than 250,000 refugees from South Sudan. Crowded and with rudimentary facilities, the camps are viewed as high risk areas for the spread of the virus, according to health experts.
With the disease in South Sudan, now just three countries in Africa have not reported any cases of COVID-19: the tiny mountain kingdom of Lesotho in southern Africa, and the island nations of Comoros and Sao Tome and Principe.
Ethiopia on Sunday reported its first death from the virus and announced five more cases bringing its total to 43, most of them imported by travelers.
Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed held discussions Sunday with opposition party leaders on measures to combat the virus. A number of Ethiopia's regional states have implemented bans on movement of people and vehicles, but not yet in the capital Addis Ababa.
In Kenya, the government extended its travel ban for 30 days.

TOKYO (AP) — As the coronavirus spreads in Japan, the chief executive of the Tokyo Games said Friday he can’t guarantee the postponed Olympics will be staged next year — even with the long delay.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe issued an emergency declaration this week to battle the virus, putting the country under restrictions after it seemed it had avoided the spread.
“I don’t think anyone would be able to say if it is going to be possible to get it under control by next July or not,"" Tokyo organizing committee CEO Toshiro Muto said, speaking through an interpreter at a news conference conducted remotely. ”We're certainly are not in a position to give you a clear answer.""
The Olympics were postponed last month with a new opening set for July 23, 2021, followed by the Paralympics on Aug. 24.
Abe has been criticized for being slow to act against the coronavirus. Opposition political leaders have suggested he downplayed the severity of the virus and have said it may have been tied to wanting to hold the Olympics this year.
“We have made the decision to postpone the games by one year,"" Muto added. “So this means that all we can do is work hard to prepare for the games. We sincerely hope that come next year mankind will manage to overcome the coronavirus crisis.”
Muto was asked if there are alternative plans to 2021.
“Rather than think about alternatives plans, we should put in all of our effort,” he said. “Mankind should bring together all of its technology and wisdom to work hard so they can development treatments, medicines and vaccines.”
Japan has reported about 5,000 cases and 100 deaths. The country has the world’s oldest population, and COVID-19 can be especially serious for the elderly.
Muto was asked several times about the added costs of postponing, which has been estimated by Japanese media at between $2 billion-$6 billion. He said it was too soon to know the price tag and who would pay.
He also acknowledged that Tokyo Olympic organizers had taken out insurance.
“Tokyo 2020 has taken out several insurance policies,"" he said. “But whether the postponement of the games qualifies as an event that is covered is not clear yet.""
He was also asked about the Olympic flame, which was taken off public display this week in Fukushima prefecture. Muto had an away-from-the-microphone talk with Tokyo spokesman Masa Takaya before talking about the flame.
“After the Olympic torch relay was canceled, the Olympic flame was put under the management of Tokyo 2020,"" Muto said. “Obviously in the future there is a possibility it might be put on display somewhere. However, for now it is under the management of Tokyo 2020 and I’m not going to make any further comment on the issue.""
There are suggestions the International Olympic Committee is thinking of taking the flame on a world tour, hoping to use it as a symbol of the battle against the virus. However, any tour would be impossible until travel restrictions are lifted.
Taking the flame away from Japan could also upset the hosts.

MOSCOW (AP) — A rebellious Russian monk who has denied the coronavirus' existence and urged believers to ignore the Kremlin's lockdown orders has taken control of a monastery in the Ural Mountains.
Father Sergiy showed up Tuesday at the Sredneuralsk women's monastery that he had founded years ago and took charge. Scores of volunteers, including battle-hardened veterans of the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine, helped enforce his rules, while the prioress and several nuns have left.
Hundreds of believers from Yekaterinburg and other cities in the Urals have flocked to the convent to hear the priest's fiery sermons.
The Russian Orthodox Church has denounced Father Sergiy's move, saying he has been banned from conducting church services and urging him to repent. Police visited the monastery Wednesday and found no violations.
Last month, the monk was suspended by the church leadership following his continuous calls to disobey the closure of churches during the lockdown. Orthodox churches across Russia were closed to parishioners on April 13 because of the coronavirus outbreak and were only allowed to reopen earlier this month.
Father Sergiy has declared the coronavirus non-existent and urged believers to ignore the lockdown orders from authorities. He denounced electronic passes introduced in Moscow and some other regions as part of efforts to stem the outbreak as “Satan's electronic camp.” The monk has described the vaccines being developed against COVID-19 as part of a global plot to control the masses.
Next week, Father Sergiy will face a church panel that will decide on his future. He also has faced charges of spreading false information about the coronavirus,
The monk has ignored the church's ban. In a video from his cell where icons and images of Orthodox Church hierarchs of the past adorn the wall alongside pictures of Russia's last Czar, Nicholas II, and Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, he warned church officials that they will need to seize the monastery by force to get him out.

The Boston Herald on comedian Jimmy Kimmel's comments regarding protesters demanding businesses be reopened:
It’s no secret that Hollywood celebrities and their ideological counterparts in the mainstream media despise President Trump. In the runup to the 2016 election, that contempt spilled over to his supporters. The “basket of deplorables” as Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton labeled them, were painted with the same rabid gun-toting, religious zealot, racist brush. In the elitist view, stereotypes are fine if they are used to defame people one doesn’t like.
It’s a new election cycle, and the disdain is back. One of the latest iterations came via Jimmy Kimmel. On his Monday night show, he referenced the country’s coronavirus shutdown. “People are getting restless,” he said. “Especially the people who aren’t too bright.”
Cutting to images of various “stay-at-home” protests across the country, Kimmel said: “I get that people need to go back to work, I do. But the point of ‘stay-at-home’ is to get a lid on this, so we can get back to work. And then stay at work. I’m starting to think that these characters who support Trump might be suicidal. They seem to fight hardest for the things that will kill them.
“They want freedom to gather in large groups during an epidemic,” he continued. “They want guns. They want pollution. I figured it out: They want to die and they’re taking us down with them.”
From a few protests around the country and people hitting newly opened beaches in Florida to Trump supporters are nihilists bent on self-destruction and want to destroy the country.
You can bet the Bel Air and Manhattan crowd loved his monologue, as it played to prejudices about those from flyover states. But here’s the thing: You can’t win voters or converts when you decry half the country as morons.
And that’s roughly the percentage who voted for Trump. In the three and a half years since, the left hasn’t made any effort to find out why voters were attracted to the president and his platform, other than attributing their choice to knee-jerk racism, lack of education, religious fervor or other “deplorable” reasons.
It’s not lost on conservatives that the left, whether in the halls of Congress or in television studios, are exasperated with gun owners’ citing the Second Amendment to support their right to own firearms, while themselves insisting that abortion is protected under that same Constitution.
Trump supporters — and that term encompasses a spectrum of conservative Americans — haven’t forgotten the “deplorables” label. Nor the Mueller probe, nor the impeachment trial. Democrats and their media and celebrity allies have done little to impress them.
And now, out of work Americans hear that they are “not that bright,” and “they want to die and they’re taking us down with them”?
Kimmel is a comedian, but we doubt people who support the president found any of that funny. Writing off half the country as buffoons with a death wish does nothing to help our nation to heal, whether it’s from pandemic anxiety or political division.
Unfortunately, it will likely not end with Kimmel, especially as states reopen and the economy, especially consumer confidence, start to pick up again. Those who can point to any positives under Trump’s watch are targets for belittling and bullying by the left.
It will be interesting to see who is laughing in November.

The Los Angles Times on President Donald Trump halting immigration to the U.S.
You have to say one thing for President Trump: He has yet to find a crisis he can’t try to exploit for his own political gain. Trump tweeted late Monday that he intends to sign an executive order halting all immigration to the U.S. (never mind that closed government offices have already effectively made it impossible to immigrate legally); reports out of the White House Tuesday said he intended to freeze new green cards for relatives of existing green card holders and for people expecting to move here to take a job offer. Notably, he didn’t attribute the decision to fears that new arrivals could exacerbate the spread of the coronavirus, but because they would compete with U.S. workers for jobs, which have been disappearing at a stunning rate in recent weeks.
Trump won election in part through bashing immigration, both legal and illegal, and has worked diligently since then to limit new arrivals while ramping up arrests of people here without permission. He has sharply lowered the cap on the number of refugees accepted for resettlement, while also trying to restrict asylum claims by denying them from people who did not present themselves at a legal port of entry.
That policy went into effect despite an immigration law that states plainly that any foreign national “who is physically present in the United States or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival…)” is eligible to apply. The administration also has forced those applying at ports of entry to remain in Mexico while the lengthy process plays out. But as the pandemic grew, the president shut down nearly all non-trade traffic at the southern and northern borders — including asylum seekers.
Now, citing the massive job losses from widespread stay at home orders, Trump intends to halt all immigration. “In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!” the president tweeted.
Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany followed that up with a statement Tuesday morning that “President Trump is committed to protecting the health and economic well-being of American citizens as we face unprecedented times. As President Trump has said, ‘Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers.’ At a time when Americans are looking to get back to work, action is necessary.”
But the president’s assertions just aren’t true. Numerous studies have found that new arrivals tend to take jobs that employers have trouble filling — often tasks that pay poorly, are dangerous and involve hard physical labor. Those workers tend to compete with and dampen wages for the immigrants who preceded them into the country.
But the new arrivals also add to the economy and help create higher-paying, less physically strenuous jobs for native-born workers. As the Brookings Institute reported in 2012, “immigrants and U.S.-born workers generally do not compete for the same jobs,” and “low-skilled immigrant laborers allow U.S.-born farmers, contractors, and craftsmen to expand agricultural production or to build more homes — thereby expanding employment possibilities and incomes for U.S. workers.” And they also help support local retail shops, restaurants and other businesses. The economic impact of immigrant workers tilts heavily to the positive end of the scale.
Does that change during an economic crisis like this? In some ways, yes. Is it reasonable to declare a short-term hiatus? Perhaps. But that has already been put into effect by the shuttering of government offices that process visa applications, by the restrictions on travel, and by the collapse of the labor market (economic migrants tend not to travel for jobs that don’t exist).
It’s hard to assess whether the president’s metaphorical barricading of the border will help or damage the economy until we see what, exactly, he will do. But bear in mind that the current disruption of the economy is not permanent, and that the president himself has argued vociferously for a (too rapid) lifting of the restraints on commerce. No one can offer a reliable sense of what the future economy will look like, but it will need workers, whether they are new-arriving immigrants or laid-off native-born Americans.
It’s no coincidence that his call for a ban on new immigrants dovetails with one of his signature campaign issues at a time when the vibrant economy he had planned to campaign on has cratered. This is about saving one job — the president’s.

The Washington Post on protesters demanding businesses be reopened:
Public fatigue with stay-at-home orders to fight the novel coronavirus pandemic is inevitable and understandable. Not understandable, nor forgivable, is the president of the United States inciting disrespect for his own government’s guidelines, which are unquestionably essential for the public health.
Relatively small protests have broken out in the United States in recent days against the strictures designed to slow the spreading virus. People have a right to protest, if they conduct themselves without endangering others. But leaders have an obligation to point out that the behavior the protesters are encouraging could reignite the virus and cost lives.
Tens of millions of Americans in recent weeks have willingly complied with stay-at-home guidelines put out by President Trump and by governors, a commendable showing of cohesion and collective good judgment. For many, it came at a steep personal sacrifice. Next will be hard choices about reopening. Doing so too soon risks reigniting a firestorm that has already cost more than 168,000 lives globally. Opening must be done with special protections, testing and data, as Mr. Trump’s own phased-in guidelines would suggest.
The protesters in the United States carried signs such as “Live Free or Die in Lockdown” and “Re-Open Now.” Some of them set a bad example, without masks or social distancing. But what was most concerning was the message that somehow all this sacrifice can be quickly abandoned in the name of liberty and rights. This is wrong. The pursuit of liberty does not mean a license to endanger the lives of others.
Mr. Trump was exceedingly reckless to incite protests with three tweets on Friday saying “LIBERATE” Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia, all of which have Democratic governors. He undermined his own published public health guidelines and his own reopening plan. His message threatens to destroy broader public confidence in the reasons for the social distancing and mitigation strategies. His comments could inspire additional disobedience and spark new outbreaks and another round of restrictions that would be even harder to impose.
Such a cycle must be avoided. There is no arguing with the facts: The virus jumps from person to person and can kill. A responsible leader would express empathy with the millions of Americans who have followed the rules, reinforce why they are necessary and offer reasonable expectations about what comes next. To fail at this is to fail at a central function of the presidency.
Some protests may reflect a genuine cry for help — from hunger, desperation and fear. These voices must be listened to, and their needs addressed as fast and far as possible.
In the end, our fate in this pandemic will be determined by what we do now, in the months or more before a vaccine. We must accept strategies that are working to keep as many people alive as possible. Shouting “liberate” invites disaster.

The New York Times on employers protecting essential workers:
Shelter-in-place orders are an effective means to slowing the spread of the coronavirus, yet millions of Americans have no choice but to leave home to go to work every day. Deemed essential for their jobs in manufacturing, grocery stores, pharmacies, warehouses, retailing and restaurants, they face daily risks by working alongside colleagues and customers who may be carriers of the coronavirus.
At grocery stores and sprawling warehouses, workers say not enough is being done to protect them from exposure. Walmart employees, for instance, say they lack sufficient sanitizing supplies and protective gear and are forced to congregate in spaces that put them well within a six-foot radius of co-workers. At meat processing plants, where production lines often require working shoulder to shoulder, the risks are particularly acute. And mass-transit workers say they haven’t been provided masks or personal cleaning supplies.
When their shifts end, they go home to their families, putting more people at risk.
Weeks into the pandemic, it’s apparent that not nearly enough is being done to protect these front-line workers, even as their continued labor ensures that a semblance of normality endures for their fellow Americans.
The Department of Labor’s primary worker safety enforcement arm, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, has taken a largely hands-off approach to the pandemic. Only last week did OSHA put a priority on investigating health care facilities for complaints about coronavirus safety procedures, while effectively giving a free pass to some of the nation’s largest employers. Without a clear set of rules to follow, employers are making them up as they go.
“As long as OSHA doesn’t take a position, these employers have a pass to say workers got sick elsewhere and it’s not their responsibility,” said Marc Perrone, international president of the United Food and Commercial Workers union, which represents some 1.3 million laborers.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued sensible guidelines on the federal level that can protect workers, such as standards for social distancing, sanitizing stations and using masks in the workplace. But OSHA hasn’t made the guidelines mandatory for workplaces — the C.D.C. itself doesn’t enforce them — nor has OSHA adopted other new rules that could help ensure worker safety during the pandemic. It should do so now. Requiring businesses to follow the C.D.C.’s guidelines would allow OSHA to enforce them with inspections and fines.
Instead, a patchwork of rules — led primarily by governors in New York, Washington State and California — serve as an unsatisfactory substitute by mandating masks in all public settings and the use of other protective measures. But these haven’t been aimed specifically at workplaces, many of which need more guidance.
OSHA said its prior rules for worker safety apply during the pandemic, though the agency last week did give agents leeway to investigate coronavirus claims so long as they were confined to health care facilities and met certain other criteria. In a statement to The New York Times, OSHA said that “employers are, and will continue to be, responsible for providing a safe and healthy workplace” and that it can respond to formal complaints where a worker is killed or seriously injured on the job, known as the General Duty clause. The agency’s Covid-19 guidance for employers, however, acknowledges upfront it “is not a standard or regulation, and it creates no new legal obligations.”
In the meantime, OSHA offices are fielding thousands of coronavirus complaints but don’t have the wherewithal to investigate them. In Oregon alone, by early this month the local OSHA office had received 2,747 complaints about workplace conditions but had issued zero citations, the top local administrator told The Portland Tribune. An OSHA official in Illinois wrote in an email to a local union that, though she had been receiving daily complaints for weeks, “these recommended measures are not enforceable by OSHA since they are guidance and not OSHA law.” OSHA also told a lawyer representing an Illinois Walmart worker who died after contracting the coronavirus that “OSHA does not have any jurisdiction on enforcing anything related to Covid-19 at this time,” according to The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
As part of an advisory last week, OSHA indicated companies should conduct their own investigations and report back to the agency.
“The message from OSHA to employers and their workers is: You’re on your own,” said Debbie Berkowitz, a former OSHA official and now program director of the National Employment Law Project.
That means a formal complaint lodged with the agency’s California division, known as Cal/OSHA, by Amazon warehouse workers in Eastvale, Calif., last week isn’t likely to result in an inspection, let alone a penalty or reform, she said. Workers there allege that, in Amazon’s rush to get customers their essential goods, they have had to work well within six feet of one another and aren’t given sufficient time or materials to sanitize their hands or their workstations. Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, said the company was working on expanding testing capacity for its hundreds of thousands of workers and called for regular universal testing to arrest the virus’s spread.
OSHA also can and should go beyond C.D.C. guidelines to require measures such as staggered shifts and lunch breaks and construction of barriers to protect employees in jobs like manufacturing and meatpacking that require close quarters. And it should carefully evaluate updated C.D.C. guidelines that permit employers to bring some workers back to the job after potential Covid-19 exposure before a two-week quarantine. Some say the new policy, meant to keep essential businesses running, risks re-exposing workers. Minnesota’s Department of Health, by contrast, has maintained a recommendation for a 14-day quarantine for workers after exposure.
OSHA has precedent on its side for tougher rules. During the H1N1 flu outbreak, it made C.D.C. rules enforceable, requiring the use of face masks and other measures to slow transmission. It has failed to act so far this time, however.
Companies may say new rules would be onerous and expensive, but the cost of prolonging the coronavirus’s spread can be far more costly: Smithfield Foods was forced to indefinitely close its Sioux Falls, S.D., plant — responsible for roughly 5 percent of the country’s pork production — after it failed to impose safety measures even as hundreds of its workers contracted the virus. The retailer Gap Inc., by contrast, told customers this month to expect slower delivery times after voluntarily following C.D.C. guidelines.
OSHA has taken steps to protect health care workers by prioritizing inspections of hospitals and other “high risk” facilities. But during the pandemic, warehouses and slaughterhouses, city buses and grocery stores have become high-risk facilities, too. If the spread of the disease is to slow, millions of workers deserve far better protection.

The Advocate on the anniversary of the Deepwater Horizon explosion:
The traumatic events of the explosion and massive oil spill ensuing off the cost of Louisiana 10 years ago are hardly forgotten.
Most of all, of course, the families of 11 men killed working on the Deepwater Horizon platform — another 17 were injured — had their lives forever altered in that moment of horror.
Those were not the only families affected.
Such a massive spill damaged the coast of our state. Then-Gov. Bobby Jindal mobilized a major operation to try to protect the coastline and wildlife. Thousands of workers and volunteers helped.
The images of birds coated in oil made an indelible impression upon the American public and that of the rest of the world, as did video of oil still spewing out many days later.
The economic impact on our region was serious, with a decline in tourism and even people curtailing purchases of seafood.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea on Friday advised nightclubs and hostess bars to close for a month and may delay the reopening of schools after linking more than a dozen new coronavirus infections to a club patron in the capital.
Schools were supposed to begin reopening next week, but the fears of a resurgence came after Friday's disclosure of 25 new cases, South Korea's first jump above 10 in five days.
“At this moment, it’s too early to say whether we need to postpone the opening of schools, but we will monitor the spread of the virus and review information” from investigations of the new cases, said Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Fewer cases in previous weeks had allowed officials to relax social distancing guidelines and schedule a phased reopening of schools, starting with high school seniors returning next Wednesday.
The government advised nightclubs, hostess bars and similar venues around the country to close for a month after officials detected at least 15 infections linked to a 29-year-old man who visited three clubs in Seoul’s Itaewon district on Saturday before testing positive on Wednesday.
Jeong said the man did not wear a mask inside the clubs and that the number of infections will likely rise as health workers trace and test contacts. The clubs’ visitor lists show they received more than 1,500 customers combined on Saturday.
The central government's advisory doesn't require clubs to close, but if they become a source of infections after failing to enforce anti-virus measures they could be shut down.
Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said the new cases included three foreigners and a soldier.
“A drop of ink in clear water spreads swiftly,” Kim said during a briefing, urging vigilance to maintain hard-won gains against the virus. “Anyone can become that drop of ink that spreads COVID-19.”
South Korea has reported more than 10,800 cases and 256 deaths from the virus.
Its professional soccer league began its new season on Friday without fans in the stands, following Tuesday’s baseball openers. Earlier this week, troops were allowed to resume leaves after two months of restrictions.
Health officials urged people to reconsider visiting their elderly parents on Friday, which is national parents’ day.
In other developments in the Asia-Pacific region:
— THAILAND SAYS CHINA, S. KOREA NOT HIGH RISK: Thailand’s health minister says the government has agreed to remove China and South Korea from its list of countries at high risk of coronavirus infections because their daily case counts have dropped. Anutin Charnvirakul said Friday that the Center for COVID-19 Situation Administration approved the action but he did not know when it would be implemented. The move would appear to exempt people from China and South Korea from a mandatory 14-day quarantine upon their arrival in Thailand. But it would not mean a sudden influx of visitors, since Thai aviation authorities have banned incoming commercial passenger flights through May 31.
— KIM PRAISES XI: North Korea says leader Kim Jong Un sent a personal message to Chinese President Xi Jinping praising what he described as China’s success in getting its coronavirus epidemic under control. The report by North Korea’s state media followed an assessment by South Korea's spy agency that the pandemic is hurting the North's economy, already crippled by policy failures and U.S.-led sanctions over its nuclear program. China is North Korea’s most significant ally and economic lifeline, accounting for about 90% of its external trade. With China’s caseload easing, some experts say North Korea could reach out to China to reinvigorate cross-border trade that has been significantly reduced in past months.
— ABE, TRUMP DISCUSS COOPERATION: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President Donald Trump have agreed to closely cooperate in developing vaccines and drugs for COVID-19. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the leaders exchanged views on the situation, measures to prevent further spread of the virus, development of drugs and vaccines and steps for reopening their economies. He said Abe initiated the phone call. Japan's Health Ministry, in a rare fast-track process, approved Gilead Sciences Inc.’s antiviral drug remdesivir on Thursday to treat COVID-19 patients.
— CHINA CENSORS EU OP-ED: The European Union delegation to China says Beijing allowed a Chinese state newspaper to publish an op-ed from the delegation only after a reference to the Chinese origins and spread of the coronavirus was removed. “The EU Delegation to China made known its objections to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in no uncertain terms,” the delegation said in a statement Friday. However, it said it decided to proceed with publication to convey key messages on climate change and sustainability, human rights, the importance of multilateralism and debt relief for highly indebted countries. Only the English-language China Daily published the editorial.
— NO TRAVEL TO AUSTRALIA JUST YET: Australia plans to reopen its economy in stages by July, but there are no plans to open to general international travelers in the foreseeable future. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said states will set their own pace in easing coronavirus restrictions. Most of Australia hasn't reported new cases for multiple days but its most populous states, New South Wales and Victoria, are recording new cases daily. Morrison was open to international students returning to Australian universities but said general international travel was some time away. The first stage of a national plan agreed upon Friday would let small cafes and restaurants open with customers spaced apart. Children will return to classrooms and groups of 10 people will be allowed to gather outdoors. Playgrounds, golf courses, swimming pools and libraries will reopen.
— LOW-KEY VESAK IN SRI LANKA: Sri Lanka's majority Buddhists celebrated Vesak — the most important religious festival of the year — in low key because of the coronavirus outbreak, as the government released 228 prisoners to mark the event. The Health Ministry has canceled all celebrations and mass gatherings. Buddhist temples were deserted on Thursday and Friday as monks requested devotees to observe the holiday at home. Vesak marks the birth, enlightenment and death of Lord Buddha.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — San Francisco is joining other U.S. cities in authorizing homeless tent encampments in response to the coronavirus pandemic, a move officials have long resisted but are now reluctantly embracing to safeguard homeless people.
About 80 tents are now neatly spaced out on a wide street near San Francisco City Hall as part of a “safe sleeping village"" opened last week. The area between the city's central library and its Asian Art Museum is fenced off to outsiders, monitored around the clock and provides meals, showers, clean water and trash pickup.
In announcing the encampment, and a second one to open in the famed Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, San Francisco's mayor acknowledged that she didn't want to approve tents, but having unregulated tents mushroom on sidewalks was neither safe nor fair.
“So while in normal times I would say that we should focus on bringing people inside and not sanctioning tent encampments, we frankly do not have many other options right now,” she said in a tweet last week.
Nicholas Woodward, 37, is camping at the safe sleeping site, but he said he preferred sleeping in his tent before the city stepped in; he finds the fencing belittling and the rules too controlling. His friend, Nathan Rice, 32, said he’d much rather have a hotel room than a tent on a sidewalk, even if the city is providing clean water and food.
“I hear it on the news, hear it from people here that they’re going to be getting us hotel rooms,” he said. “That’s what we want, you know, to be safe inside.”
San Francisco has moved 1,300 homeless people into hotel rooms and RVs as part of a statewide program to shelter vulnerable people but the mayor has been criticized for moving too slowly. She has said she is not inclined to move all the city’s estimated 8,000 homeless into hotels, despite complaints from advocates who say overcrowded tents are a public health disaster.
San Francisco is just the latest city to authorize encampments as shelters across the country move to thin bed counts so homeless people, who are particularly susceptible to the virus due to poor health, have more room to keep apart.
Santa Rosa in Sonoma County welcomed people this week to its first managed encampment with roughly 70 blue tents. Portland, Oregon, has three homeless camps with city-provided sleeping bags and tents, and Maricopa County opened two parking lots to homeless campers in Phoenix.
San Francisco officials have historically frowned upon mini tent cities and routinely rounded up tents on city streets. But with an estimated 150,000 homeless people in California, most of them living out in the open, it's impossible to stamp out the highly visible tents along highways and on crowded urban sidewalks.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that officials not disturb tent encampments during the coronavirus pandemic unless people are given individual hotel rooms, as homeless advocates want to see. Those advocates say providing a safe space where people can get meals, use a toilet and avoid harassing passers-by is a reasonable option given the times.
“The best, best option would be housing. The second-best option would be hotel rooms, but if you can’t do that and we’re going to have so many people outside then I think it makes sense ... to make those outside as safe as can be,” said Dr. Margot Kushel, director of the Center for Vulnerable Populations at the University of California, San Francisco.
But Nan Roman, president and CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said the federal government is providing an astonishing amount of money to battle the pandemic and she hopes cities and counties use it to put people into empty hotels, motels and other unused places.
“It's almost like we’re giving ourselves permission that it’s OK that people will sleep outside, and once we’ve given ourselves that permission, it’s very difficult to get the initiative together to do otherwise,"" she said.
Still, government-sanctioned tent camps may be here to stay, at least until a coronavirus vaccine is distributed.
At the urging of San Francisco Supervisor Sandra Lee Fewer, the city's parks and real estate departments are compiling an inventory of open spaces that might be suitable for tent camps. She said sidewalk space is a coveted commodity for retailers, given coronavirus restrictions, and the city's strategy of adding more shelter beds doesn't make sense with a contagious virus.
”It is just a new world that we’re living in,"" she said, “and it’s going to have to be our new normal.""

Faced with a collapsed job market, Congress needs to tend to unemployment insurance funds supporting millions thrown out of work, but surging debt means there are limits to the scope of federal aid to help heal the coronavirus -damaged economy, the Senate's top leader said Tuesday.
In his first public appearances in his home state of Kentucky since March 13 due to the pandemic, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell spoke at length about the prospects of another round of coronavirus relief passing the Republican-led Senate.
“Obviously, a lot of Americans have lost their jobs, so we need to make sure we have unemployment insurance properly funded for as long as we need,"" McConnell said during an appearance in Lexington. “And that could well lead to yet another bill.""
McConnell said another round of federal assistance to state and local governments is possible, but he stopped short of committing to it. He expressed concern about the financial plight faced by cities, counties and states but added that the mushrooming national debt is also a concern.
“We don’t know yet,"" the senator said. “We’re still measuring the impact of what we’ve already done, and all of that money is not yet out.”
In Kentucky, economic damage caused by the pandemic will force cutting about $457 million, or 4%, from the General Fund in the current fiscal year, plus a potential special legislative session to downsize the Road Fund. The General Fund pays for most state services.
Gov. Andy Beshear has said Kentucky has enough in its unemployment insurance trust fund until summer to meet the unprecedented demand for benefits but will eventually need a cash infusion.
The health crisis, and the economic fallout, is unfolding as McConnell seeks a seventh Senate term in this year's elections in Kentucky.
While acknowledging the Senate will probably take up another relief bill, McConnell said it will be “much more narrowly focused” than the $3 trillion version passed by the Democratic-led House.
Raising alarm about surging deficits, he said: “We can’t keep propping up the economy forever.""
“We now have a national debt the size of our economy for the first time since World War II, and that is a matter of some concern,"" the senator added.
McConnell continued to insist that the next package include federal liability protections for businesses that reopen.
“We cannot have an open economy with an epidemic of lawsuits on the heels of the pandemic that we’re working our way through,"" he said. “So I can guarantee you that if there’s another bill, and there probably will be, it will include litigation protection related only to the coronavirus pandemic.”
McConnell listed three factors he said were key to getting back to “full normalcy” from the health crisis — testing, treatment and a vaccine. McConnell held a mask while he spoke and donned it afterward.
The senator went to medical facilities in Louisville and Lexington to express gratitude to front-line healthcare workers. No one knows how long it will take for the country to recover financially from the pandemic, he said, adding: “The ultimate solution is to get to a vaccine as quickly as possible.”
McConnell noted that senators wore masks, socially distanced and followed other health guidelines while in session recently, adding “we did just fine.” But he added: “If you’re an older person and have pre-existing conditions, you probably ought to be extremely cautious and maybe still stay at home.""

UNDATED (AP) — South Korea has reported 19 new cases of the coronavirus, most from the Seoul metropolitan area, where officials have been actively tracing transmissions linked to nightclubs and other entertainment venues. South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday also reported two more deaths, bringing national totals to 11,225 cases and 269 fatalities. Officials linked three of the new cases to international arrivals. South Korea has been reporting around 20 new cases per day over the past two weeks after health workers found hundreds of infections linked to club goers who went out in early May as the country eased social distancing measures.
CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — A U.S. biotechnology company has begun injecting a coronavirus vaccine candidate into people in Australia with hopes of releasing a proven vaccine this year. A Novavax official says 131 volunteers will get an injection in the first phase of the trial testing the safety of the vaccine and looking for signs of its effectiveness. About a dozen experimental vaccines are in early stages of testing or poised to start. It’s not clear that any will prove safe and effective. But they use different methods and technologies, increasing the odds one might succeed. Novovax expects the results of the Australian trial to be known in July and it's making more doses in anticipation the vaccine will work.
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration’s new strategy for coronavirus testing puts much of the burden on states while promising to provide supplies such as swabs and material to transport specimens. The plan, which was delivered Sunday to members of Congress, has drawn harsh criticism from top congressional Democrats. They say the administration “still does not have a serious plan for increasing testing to stop the spread of the virus.” The 81-page document from the Department of Health and Human Services comes as the U.S. death toll from the pandemic is approaching 100,000.
LOS ANGELES (AP) — California says churches can resume in-person services but the congregations will be limited to less than 100 and worshippers should wear masks, avoid sharing prayer books and skip the collection plate. The state Department of Public Health released a framework Monday for county health officials to permit houses of worship to reopen. Most have been limited to online and remote services since March, when Gov. Gavin Newsom's stay-at-home order took effect to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Newsom has been relaxing those restrictions for restaurantss and other businesses. Several thousand churches had vowed to defy Newsom's order on May 31, which is Pentacost Sunday, a major holiday for many Christians.
UNDATED (AP) — A lawyer for the family of a Connecticut murder suspect pleaded Monday for his surrender as police involved in a multi-state search for the 23-year-old college student circulated a photo of a person matching his description walking along railroad tracks in Pennsylvania. Peter Manfredonia, a University of Connecticut senior, is suspected of killing Ted DeMers, 62, and Nicholas Eisele, 23, before forcing Eisele’s girlfriend into her car and fleeing the state with her. The woman, 23, was located Sunday at a rest stop near Paterson, New Jersey, with her 2016 Volkswagen Jetta, police said, and was not hurt.

VIRUS OUTBREAK-MLB TEAM STAFF CUTS
MLB wants to cut player salaries if games are played without fans
NEW YORK (AP) — Major League Baseball players are bracing for a battle with owners over the possibility of reduced salaries caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Players are upset over the prospect teams may seek additional pay cuts if games are played in empty ballparks. Their anger was stoked last week when New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he was told by Mets chief operating officer Jeff Wilpon that the union would have to agree to lower salaries if games are played without fans.
A March 26 deal between the sides states “the Office of the Commissioner and Players Association will discuss in good faith the economic feasibility of playing games in the absence of spectators or at appropriate substitute neutral sites."" The union points to another passage covering salaries in which players agree to give up 1/162nd of base pay for each regular season game lost.
Meanwhile, Commissioner Rob Manfred has made a move that allows teams to lay off or cut the pay of major and minor league managers, coaches, trainers and full-time scouts starting May 1.
Manfred has suspended uniform employee contracts that cover about 9,000 people, including general managers on some teams. Manfred cited the inability to play games due to the national emergency caused by the pandemic.
VIRUS OUTBREAK-SPORTS POLL
Poll shows fans leery of returning to stadiums, arenas without vaccine
UNDATED (AP) — The possibility of professional sports resuming without fans is growing. And a recent poll suggests a majority of fans wouldn't feel safe attending games anyway without a vaccine for the new coronavirus.
One sports business expert says losses of fan-related revenue will be substantial even if clubs begin cashing in on lucrative media rights deals again. Losses could reach $3 billion among the NBA, NHL, Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer.
The Seton Hall Sports Poll found that 72% of Americans wouldn't feel safe attending games without a vaccine. The number drops to 61% among respondents who identify as sports fans.
Seventy percent said the NFL shouldn’t start in the fall to ensure the safety of players, even if some form of social distancing is still in place.
Just over three-quarters said they would have the same interest watching a broadcast of live sports played without fans.

Djokovic says he won’t take vaccine
UNDATED (AP) — Novak Djokovic (JOH’-koh-vihch) says he won’t take any anti-coronavirus vaccination if it becomes compulsory for tennis players to return to the world tours.
The world’s top-ranked men’s tennis player said in a live Facebook chat he wouldn’t “be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel.” Djokovic and his wife have two children and have spoken previously against vaccinations.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL-NBA DRAFT
Butler ready to bolt Baylor
UNDATED (AP) — Baylor's top two scorers are entering their names in the NBA draft while keeping open their options to return to the Bears.
All-Big 12 sophomore guard Jared Butler announced his intentions Monday on Twitter. Junior guard MaCio Teague said last month that he was exploring the NBA draft. Butler was third in the Big 12 with 16 points a game, while Teague scored 13.9 points a game.
And Washington State star CJ Elleby plans to go through the NBA draft process. Elleby led the Cougars in scoring and rebounding this past season as a sophomore, delivering 18.4 points and 7.8 boards a game. He can still return to Washington State for his junior season as long as he withdraws his name by 5 p.m. on June 15.
In other college basketball news:
— Arkansas guard Isaiah Joe has declared himself eligible for the NBA draft, but he has not hired an agent in a decision that would allow him to return to school next season. The 6-foot-5 sophomore averaged 16.9 points and 4.1 rebounds per game this past season and led the SEC in 3-point goals. He missed five games after having surgery on his right knee.
— Memphis says it has added guard-forward Landers Nolley II as a transfer from Virginia Tech. Nolley was on the Atlantic Coast Conference all-freshman team this past season after averaging a team-high 15.5 points and 5.8 rebounds with the Hokies. He started 29 of 32 games with Virginia Tech and ranked 12th nationally among freshmen in scoring.
— Kentucky has signed former Rhode Island forward Jacob Toppin (TAH’-pihn), the brother of consensus national player of the year Obi (OH’-bee) Toppin of Dayton. Toppin averaged 5.1 and 3.9 rebounds per game while starting three of 30 contests as a Rams freshman. He must sit out next season per NCAA transfer rules but will have three seasons of eligibility remaining.
NFL-MOCK DRAFT
No major problems as GMs run mock draft
UNDATED (AP)— There were no major snafus as the NFL held a practice draft Monday to test technology and communications for the real thing beginning Thursday night.
Several people involved in the test said there were some technical glitches, including when the Bengals were making the first selection and at various other spots. A few of them spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to comment publicly.
Commissioner Roger Goodell earlier this month warned team executives not to be critical of the process, nor of the league's decision to go ahead with the draft as scheduled April 23-25. Broncos general manager John Elway and 49ers GM John Lynch said they were satisfied with the proceedings.
Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst remains confident the unusual nature of this year’s event will still allow for plenty of trade talk.
NFL-JAGUARS
Jags cut Lee, eye deal for Fournette
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) — The Jacksonville Jaguars have waived oft-injured receiver Marqise Lee to create nearly $5 million in salary cap space, parting with a player who had just three receptions the last two years combined. The Jaguars were waiting for Lee to get fully healthy before letting him go, giving him the best chance to pass a physical with another team. He missed the entire 2018 season following a major knee injury and injured his shoulder last October, causing him to miss the final eight games.
And the Jaguars are ready to cut ties with running back Leonard Fournette just three years after making him the fourth overall pick in the NFL draft. A person familiar with the situation said Fournette could get moved before or during the draft, which begins Thursday.
TENNIS-DOPING-JARRY
Jarry gets 11-month doping ban
UNDATED (AP) — Top 100 tennis player Nicolas Jarry has been given an 11-month doping ban by the International Tennis Federation. The punishment stems from a failed drug test at the Davis Cup Finals in November.
Jarry is a 24-year-old from Chile who is currently ranked 89th in singles. He has been as high as No. 38.
He was provisionally suspended in January, but the ITF is back-dating his ban to December. Jarry can return to action in November.
KOBE BRYANT CRASH-LAWSUIT
Family members of four victims sue over Kobe Bryant crash
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Family members of four of the people killed in a helicopter crash with Kobe Bryant and his daughter are suing the companies that owned and operated the aircraft.
The wrongful death lawsuits were filed electronically Sunday in Los Angeles Superior Court on behalf of three members of one family and a woman who helped coach Bryant's daughter in basketball.
The group was heading to a basketball tournament Jan. 26 when the chopper crashed in thick fog northwest of Los Angeles.
The suits allege that Island Express Helicopters Inc. was careless and negligent in the crash that killed nine.
OBIT-BLACK
Neil Black, British track and field official, dies at 60
LONDON (AP) — A British track and field official who worked closely with Mo Farah and many of the country’s best athletes has died. Neil Black was 60.
British Athletics says Black died suddenly over the weekend.
He was performance director of British Athletics from 2012 until last year. He stepped down after coming under pressure because of the organization’s handling of a controversy involving Alberto Salazar after the coach was banned for four years for doping violations.
Black has worked with Britain’s top athletes since the 1990s. He was the chief physiotherapist and head of sports science at British Athletics before becoming performance director.

DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — “Are you going to die?” my 8-year-old daughter asked me the other day. “They said on the radio that adults are getting sick and dying.”
""Maybe you should stay inside.""
Instantly I was flooded with the anguish so many parents around the world are carrying right now because we cannot protect our children from these grown-up fears.
My daughter already knows parents can die in epidemics. Her biological father was one of them.
We don’t talk much about her early life in Sierra Leone, when 3,956 people died during the Ebola epidemic from 2014 to 2016. Then, as now with the coronavirus, there was no vaccine and no cure.
And yet nearly two years after her adoption, Ebola still falls into our conversations when we least expect it. Once it was a toddler we befriended at the pool who happened to share the same name as her uncle. He'd died of Ebola, too.
I’ve tried so hard to make her to feel safe in Senegal alongside her sisters, now 6 and 4, whom I’ve also adopted. Only now we have one of those all-too-familiar hand-washing stations right inside our gate.
Maybe I anticipated my oldest daughter's fear amid COVID-19 because the scent of diluted bleach sometimes makes my own stomach turn. I covered the Ebola epidemic as a journalist for The Associated Press, first in Liberia and then in Sierra Leone.
I remember the sick being pushed in wheelbarrows down the street, the children so traumatized after their families died that they were unable to speak. Relatives kept vigil outside treatment centers, sometimes notified of a death only after cremation.
Ebola changed the course of my daughters’ lives in immeasurable ways that are still unfolding. And it changed mine: The year after the epidemic ended in Sierra Leone, I decided to adopt there.
Not as some kind of “white savior,” since the best life for my girls always would have been one where Ebola never ravaged their community. Still, having survived a family tragedy of my own, I was determined to find what joy I could. I thought we could do that together.
Only now school is no longer in session, and two birthdays have come and gone without friends. There are no swimming lessons, no trips to the beach.
I reassure my girls that COVID-19 isn’t as deadly as Ebola, which can kill more than half its victims. But I know coronavirus is everywhere — and it's proving much harder to track.
Senegal has managed to avoid the mass casualties seen in other places. Yet what I see elsewhere feels all too familiar: relatives who never saw their loved ones again after dropping them off for care. Doctors who say they could have saved more people if only they had more resources.
My oldest daughter, too, has her own memories of that era. But that’s her story to tell one day, when she's ready.
I will share one personal detail, though, that we all should bear in mind as this unfolds. It seems emotionless until you understand the weight this tiny fact carries.
Her birth father died on April 10, 2015.
The first time I saw this on a weathered death certificate in my adoption lawyer’s office, my heart sank knowing he survived the worst of the epidemic only to still lose his life.
I later looked it up: There were only 400 new cases reported the month he died, down from some 3,300 just five months before. And yet it would be almost another year before Sierra Leone was finally declared Ebola-free.
In sharing this piece of our sorrow, I ask: How many deaths will we endure long after we stop talking about the peaks of COVID-19?
The child of the last person to die from coronavirus will still be an orphan.

NEW YORK (AP) — Even as coronavirus deaths mount across Europe and New York, the U.S. and other countries are starting to contemplate an exit strategy and thinking about a staggered and carefully calibrated easing of restrictions designed to curb the scourge.
“To end the confinement, we’re not going to go from black to white; we’re going to go from black to gray,” top French epidemiologist Jean-François Delfraissy said in a radio interview.
Deaths, hospitalizations and new infections are leveling off in places like Italy and Spain, and even New York has seen encouraging signs amid the gloom. At the same time, politicians and health officials warn that the crisis is far from over and a catastrophic second wave could hit if countries let down their guard too soon.
“We are flattening the curve because we are rigorous about social distancing,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. “But it’s not a time to be complacent. It’s not a time to do anything different than we’ve been doing.”
In a sharp reminder of the danger, New York state on Wednesday recorded its highest one-day increase in deaths, 779, for an overall death toll of almost 6,300.
“The bad news is actually terrible,” Cuomo lamented. Still, the governor said that hospitalizations are decreasing and that many of those now dying fell ill in the outbreak’s earlier stages.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it was issuing new guidelines for some workers who have been within 6 feet of someone with a confirmed or suspected infection to go back on the job if they have no symptoms. The guidelines apply to employees in critical fields such as health care and food supply and require they take their temperature beforehand, wear face masks at all times and practice social distancing.
In other developments:
— Stocks shot 3.4% higher on Wall Street amid the encouraging signs about the outbreak’s trajectory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 780 points.
— U.S. researchers opened another safety test of an experimental COVID-19 vaccine, this one using a skin-deep shot instead of the usual deeper jab. A different vaccine candidate began safety testing in people last month in Seattle.
— British Prime Minister Boris Johnson spent a second night in intensive care but was improving and sitting up in bed, authorities said.
— Saudi Arabian officials announced that the Saudi-led coalition fighting Shiite rebels in Yemen will begin a cease-fire starting Thursday. They said the two-week truce was in response to U.N. calls to halt hostilities around the world amid the epidemic.
In China, the lockdown of Wuhan, the industrial city of 11 million where the global pandemic began, was lifted after 76 days, allowing people to come and go. The country on Thursday announced two additional deaths in Wuhan but no new cases there.
Wuhan residents will have to use a smartphone app showing that they are healthy and have not been in recent contact with anyone confirmed to have the virus. Schools remain closed, people are still checked for fever when they enter buildings and masks are strongly encouraged.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the United States' top infectious-diseases expert, said the Trump administration has been working on plans to eventually reopen the country amid evidence that social distancing is working to stop the virus’s spread.
But he said it's not time to scale back such measures: “Keep your foot on the accelerator because this is what is going to get us through this,” he said at Wednesday's White House briefing.
Vice President Mike Pence warned that Philadelphia was emerging as a potential hot spot, saying that he spoke to Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf and that Pittsburgh was also being monitored for a possible rise in cases.
The U.S. is also seeing hot spots in such places as Washington, D.C., Louisiana, Chicago, Detroit and Colorado. The New York metropolitan area, which includes northern New Jersey, Long Island and lower Connecticut, accounts for about half of all virus deaths in the U.S.
Pence said he would speak to leaders in African-American communities who are concerned about disproportionate impacts from the virus. Fauci acknowledged that historic disparities in health care have put African-Americans at risk for diseases that make them more vulnerable in the outbreak, adding that makes it even more imperative for communities of color to practice social distancing.
In Europe, Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte is expected to announce in the coming days how long the country’s lockdown will remain in place amid expectations that some restrictions could be eased. Discussions are focused first on opening more of the country's industries.
Proposals being floated in Italy include the issuing of immunity certificates, which would require antibody blood tests, and allowing younger workers to return first, as they are less vulnerable to the virus.
Italy, the hardest-hit country, recorded its biggest one-day jump yet in people counted as recovered and had its smallest one-day increase in deaths in more than a month. Nearly 18,000 have died there.
In Spain, which has tallied more than 14,000 dead, Budget Minister María Jesús Montero said Spaniards will progressively regain their “normal life” from April 26 onwards but warned that the “de-escalation” of the lockdown will be “very orderly to avoid a return to the contagion.”
The government has been tight-lipped about what measures could be in place once the confinement is relaxed, stressing that they will be dictated by experts
Without giving specifics, French authorities have likewise begun to speak openly of planning the end of the country's confinement period, which is set to expire April 15 but will be extended, according to the president's office. The virus has claimed more than 10,000 lives in France.
Earlier this week, Austria and the Czech Republic jumped out ahead of other European countries and announced plans to relax some restrictions.
Starting Thursday, Czech stores selling construction materials, hobby supplies and bicycles will be allowed to reopen. Only grocery stores, pharmacies and garden stores are up and running. The reopened businesses will have to offer customers disinfectant and disposable gloves and enforce social distancing.
Austria will begin reopening small shops, hardware stores and garden centers on Tuesday, and shopping malls and hair salons could follow two weeks later. People will have to wear face masks.
Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said authorities will watch carefully and will “pull the emergency brake” if the virus makes a comeback.
British government officials, beset with a rising death toll of more than 7,000, said there is little chance the nationwide lockdown there will be eased when its current period ends next week.
The desire to get back to normal is driven in part by the damage to world economies.
The Bank of France said the French economy has entered recession, with an estimated 6% drop in the first quarter compared with the previous three months, while Germany, Europe’s economic powerhouse, is also facing a deep recession. Expert said its economy will shrink 4.2% this year.
Japan, the world’s third-largest economy, could contract by a record 25% this quarter, the highest since gross domestic product began to be tracked in 1955.
Worldwide, 1.5 million people have been confirmed infected and around 90,000 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University. The true numbers are almost certainly much higher, because of limited testing, different rules for counting the dead and concealment by some governments.
For most, the virus causes mild to moderate symptoms such as fever and cough. But for some older adults and the infirm, it can cause pneumonia and death. Over 300,000 people have recovered.

NEW YORK (AP) — Tiffany Pinckney remembers the fear when COVID-19 stole her breath. So when she recovered, the New York City mother became one of the country’s first survivors to donate her blood to help treat other seriously ill patients.
“It is definitely overwhelming to know that in my blood, there may be answers,” Pinckney told The Associated Press.
Doctors around the world are dusting off a century-old treatment for infections: Infusions of blood plasma teeming with immune molecules that helped survivors beat the new coronavirus. There’s no proof it will work. But former patients in Houston and New York were early donors, and now hospitals and blood centers are getting ready for potentially hundreds of survivors to follow.
“There’s a tremendous call to action,” said Dr. David Reich, president of New York’s Mount Sinai Hospital, which declared Pinckney recovered and raced to collect her blood. “People feel very helpless in the face of this disease. And this is one thing that people can do to help their fellow human beings.”
As treatments get underway, “we just hope it works,"" he said.
What the history books call “convalescent serum” was most famously used during the 1918 flu pandemic, and also against measles, bacterial pneumonia and numerous other infections before modern medicine came along. Why? When infection strikes, the body starts making proteins called antibodies specially designed to target that germ. Those antibodies float in survivors’ blood — specifically plasma, the yellowish liquid part of blood — for months, even years.
When new diseases erupt and scientists are scrambling for vaccines or drugs, it's “a stopgap measure that we can put into place quickly,” said Dr. Jeffrey Henderson of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, who is helping to develop a nationwide study.
(This) is not a cure per se, but rather it is a way to reduce the severity of illness.
–Dr. Jeffrey Henderson, Washington University School of Medicine
This “is not a cure per se, but rather it is a way to reduce the severity of illness,” Henderson said.
Doctors don’t know how long survivors' antibodies against COVID-19 will persist.
But for now, “they're the safest ones on the street,” said Dr. Rebecca Haley of Bloodworks Northwest in Seattle, which is working to identify donors. ""We would not be making a dent in their antibody supply for themselves.""
Last week, the Food and Drug Administration told hospitals how to seek case-by-case emergency permission to use convalescent plasma, and Houston Methodist Hospital and Mount Sinai jumped at the chance.
And a desperate public responded, with families taking to social media to plead on behalf of sick loved ones and people recovering asking how they could donate. According to Michigan State University, more than 1,000 people signed up with the National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project alone. Dozens of hospitals formed that group to spur plasma donation and research.
Would-be donors can’t just show up at a blood center. Those with a proven infection who’ve been symptom-free for several weeks must get tested to ensure the virus is gone. They also must be healthy enough to meet the other requirements for blood donation — plus get an additional test to see if their antibody level is high enough.
“You don’t want to take plasma from someone who had a mediocre immune response. That wouldn’t be helpful,” said Dr. Julie Ledgerwood of the National Institutes of Health.
Chinese doctors last week reported that five patients given convalescent plasma all showed some improvement about a week later. But they also received other therapies, and without a rigorous study, there’s no way to know if the plasma made the difference.
Studies are being planned to test convalescent plasma against regular care in sick patients, and to prevent infections among people at high risk of exposure such as health care workers.
Another approach: Spain-based plasma manufacturer Grifols aims to concentrate donor plasma in a North Carolina factory, creating a high-dose version that also would need testing.
Separately, NIH researchers are measuring survivors’ antibody levels to learn how strong the vaccines under development must be to protect. Other teams, including at Beijing's Tsinghua University, are hunting which antibodies are most potent, to copy in a lab and turn into drugs.
But donations from people like Pinckney could be used as fast as blood centers can process it. She got sick the first week of March. First came the fever and chills. She couldn’t catch her breath, and deep breathing caused chest pains. The single mother worried about her sons, 9 and 16.
“I remember being on my bathroom floor crying and praying,” the 39-year-old said.
So when Mount Sinai, which diagnosed her, called Pinckney to check on her recovery and ask if she’d consider donating, she didn’t hesitate.
“It’s humbling. And for me, it’s also a beacon of hope for someone else,” she said.

PARIS (AP) — The virus crisis has triggered the worst global recession in nearly a century -- and the pain is not over yet even if there is no second wave of infections, an international economic report warned Wednesday.
Hundreds of millions of people have lost their jobs, and the crisis is hitting the poor and young people the hardest, worsening inequalities, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said in its latest analysis of global economic data.
“It is probably the most uncertain and dramatic outlook since the creation of the OECD,” Secretary General Angel Gurria said. “We cannot make projections as as we normally do.”
In the best-case scenario, if there is no second wave of infections, the agency forecast a global drop in economic output of 6% this year, and a rise of 2.8% next year.
If the coronavirus re-emerges later in the year, however, the global economy could shrink 7.6%, the OECD said.
“With or without a second outbreak, the consequences will be severe and long-lasting,” the report says.
Global stock markets dropped after the release of the report, which is more downbeat than other forecasts from the likes of the World Bank.
Gurria argued that “presenting the problem as the choice between lives and livelihoods, meaning a choice between health and the economy, is a false dilemma. If the pandemic is not brought under control, there will be no robust economic recovery.”
In case of a second wave of contagions, the OECD forecast that the average unemployment rate across the 37 developed countries that it represents would double this year to 10% and see “little recovery” in 2021. In the more optimistic scenario, the figure would be 9.2%. In poorer countries, the numbers are often higher, and informal workers are especially vulnerable.
The agency urged governments to tackle inequalities by investing in health care systems, global cooperation on medical supplies, vaccine and treatments and retraining people whose sectors are the hardest-hit.
The virus has infected 7.2 million people worldwide and killed at least 411,000, according to official figures tallied by Johns Hopkins University. The true toll is believed to be much higher.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — With COVID-19 still careening across the planet, the annual gathering of its leaders in New York will be replaced this year by a global patchwork of prerecorded speeches, another piece of upheaval in a deeply divided world turned topsy-turvy by a pandemic with no endpoint in sight.
As U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres put it: “The COVID-19 pandemic is a crisis unlike any in our lifetimes, and so this year’s General Assembly session will be unlike any other, too.”
This is the first time in the 75-year history of the United Nations that there will be no in-person meeting. Gone will be the accompanying traffic jams, street closures for VIP motorcades, stepped-up security to protect leaders and noisy crowds in the halls of the sprawling United Nations complex overlooking New York’s East River.
Only one diplomat from each of the U.N.’s 193 member nations will be allowed into the vast General Assembly hall. All will be socially distanced and masked.
Guterres said the virtual meeting will see speeches from “the largest number of heads of state and government ever"" — 171, according to the latest speakers list.
World leaders are not barred from coming to speak in person. But presidents, prime ministers, monarchs and ministers travel with large entourages and at a time of pandemic and quarantine requirements, including in New York City, the General Assembly members agreed that crowds needed to be avoided.
They recommended that leaders each deliver a 15-minute pre-recorded speech, to be shown in the assembly hall and introduced by the ambassador or a diplomat from the country.
Turkish diplomat and politician Volkan Bozkir, who took over the one-year presidency of the General Assembly on Tuesday, said 10 leaders wanted to come to the U.N. to speak including Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He lamented that they aren't able to because of US quarantine requirements.
This leaves U.S. President Donald Trump as the one leader who could travel to New York. Even though reports say he will not be appearing in person, the metal barricades police always put in place for a presidential visit went up Friday along First Avenue outside the United Nations.
The high-level meetings begin Monday with a commemoration of the U.N.’s 75th anniversary, including statements from world leaders and formal adoption of a declaration approved by all 193 member nations. It recalls the U.N.’s successes and failures and calls for “greater action” to build a post-pandemic world that is more equal, works together and protects the planet.
The United Nations was born out of the horrors of World War II with a mission to save succeeding generations from the scourge of conflict. The declaration says the U.N. has helped mitigate dozens of conflicts and saved hundreds of thousands of lives through humanitarian action. But it points to a world “plagued by growing inequality, poverty, hunger, armed conflicts, terrorism, insecurity, climate change, and pandemics.”
“The stakes could not be higher,"" Guterres told a news conference Wednesday.
He pointed to an “out-of-control” pandemic that has claimed nearly a million lives and stressed the need for a deeply divided world to unite not only to defeat the coronavirus and ensure that “a people’s vaccine” is available to all people but to make a collective push for peace.
Monday’s anniversary commemoration will be followed by Tuesday’s opening of the virtual high-level meeting, starting with Guterres’ in-person speech on the state of the world in which he said he will repeat his March 23 call for a global cease-fire, this time by the end of the year.
“Today, from Afghanistan to Sudan, we see hopeful new steps toward peace,” the U.N. chief said. “In Syria, Libya, Ukraine and elsewhere, cease-fires or standstills in the fighting can create space for diplomacy. In Yemen, we are pressing for a cease-fire, confidence building measures and resumption of the political process.”
Guterres will be followed by addresses Tuesday from Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro, Trump, leaders from Turkey, China, Cuba, Russia, Jordan, Iran, France and dozens of others through Sept. 26. The speeches conclude on the morning of Sept. 29 after a two-day break.
Usually, hundreds of side events take place during the gathering. This year there are only a few meetings, including ones on digital cooperation, climate action, biodiversity and accelerating the pandemic's end. Two meetings commemorate the 25th anniversary of the U.N. women’s conference in Beijing and promote the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons.
Guterres, the General Assembly’s Bozkir and many U.N. diplomats say the key issue for world leaders today is how to build a post-pandemic world that is more peaceful and united and focuses on eradicating extreme poverty, preserving the environment and achieving gender equality by 2030.
Even before the pandemic, Guterres said, the world “was veering off course” and losing the battle against climate change. He cited the northern hemisphere's hottest summer ever, with ongoing wildfires.
“The world is burning, and recovery is our chance to get on track and tame the flames,"" he said.
As in recent years past, a major theme in speeches is expected to be multilateralism — the kind of cooperation that Guterres stressed is required for recovery from COVID-19.
“Multilateralism is the panacea to all the problems in the world,” Bozkir said. He warned that unilateralism will only strengthen the COVID-19 crisis, saying that “no state can combat this pandemic alone.”
France’s U.N. Ambassador Nicolas de Rivière said the high-level week “will be an opportunity to reflect on the current COVID-19 crisis, and to reaffirm the crucial role of the United Nations and of multilateral cooperation, which are badly needed in these times.”
While the high-level meeting of world leaders often faces criticism for its constant speechmaking and lack of visible results, much of its business takes place in one-on-one meetings and at lunches, dinners and small gatherings — and for U.N. officials and diplomats that will be the real missing ingredient this year.
“We will miss that contact, that personal contact, that I believe is very important for diplomacy to be effective,” Guterres said, pointing to several unnamed situations where problems had no solutions but he was able to sit with both sides and discuss a way forward.
But even without face-to-face interactions, Bozkir said that after six months of almost entirely virtual meetings, “I think with all the high-level meetings and summits, we’re going to show that the U.N. is back.""
“Many people were thinking, Where is the U.N.?,'"" he said. “So now we will say,
Here is the U.N.'""

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. unemployment fell to 11.1% in June as the economy added a solid 4.8 million jobs, the government reported Thursday. But the job-market recovery may already be faltering because of a new round of closings and layoffs triggered by a resurgence of the coronavirus.
While the jobless rate was down from 13.3% in May, it is still at a Depression-era level. And the data was gathered during the second week of June, just before a number of states began to reverse or suspend the reopenings of their economies to try to beat back the virus again.
“This is a bit of a dated snapshot at this point,” said Jesse Edgerton, an economist at J.P. Morgan Chase.
The news came as the number of confirmed infections per day in the U.S. soared to an all-time high of 50,700, more than doubling over the past month, according to the count kept by Johns Hopkins University.
The spike, centered primarily in the South and West, has led states such as California, Texas, Arizona and Florida to re-close or otherwise clamp down again on bars, restaurants, movie theaters, beaches and swimming pools, throwing some workers out of a job for a second time.
President Donald Trump said the jobs report shows the economy is “roaring back,” though he acknowledged there are still areas where “we’re putting out the flames” of the virus.
Economists expect the recovery to take longer than Trump’s optimistic projections, with the unemployment rate likely to be near double-digit levels by year’s end.
“Even as we move into the second half of the year, a large number of people will still be looking for work,” said Eric Winograd, senior U.S. economist at asset manager AllianceBernstein.
The shutdowns over the past two weeks will be reflected in the July unemployment report, to be released in early August.
While the job market improved in June for a second straight month, the Labor Department report showed that the U.S. has recouped only about one-third of the colossal 22 million jobs lost during the lockdowns this spring.
This is a bit of a dated snapshot at this point.
–Jesse Edgerton, economist
Layoffs are still running high: The number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits fell only slightly last week to 1.4 million, according to another report. Though the weekly figure has declined steadily since peaking in March, it is still extraordinarily large by historic standards.
And the total number of people who are drawing jobless benefits remains at a sizable 19 million.
U.S. job growth in June was driven mainly by companies recalling workers who had been laid off during the widespread business shutdowns across the country.
In an ominous trend contained in the Labor Department report, the number of Americans who said they had lost their jobs permanently rose by 600,000 last month to nearly 2.9 million.
Many businesses — particularly small ones — are shutting down for good even though the lockdowns have been largely lifted.
Erik Hurst, an economics professor at the University of Chicago, said many restaurants, bars and gyms can’t survive by operating at half-capacity, and customers are going to be cautious until there is a vaccine.
“We don’t want to get our hair cut as much as we used to,” Hurst said. “We don’t want to go out to eat out as much as we used to.”
Fred Wellman’s five employees are getting their final paychecks Friday as he closes down his public relations firm. He was able to get a small-business loan from the government, but it wasn’t enough.
He usually drums up most of his business at conferences, seminars and other in-person events. But “if people aren’t meeting in person, if people aren’t holding events, you don’t get a chance to mingle,” he said.

The job gains of the past two months have partly resulted from unprecedented levels of government spending, including $1,200 stimulus checks, more than $500 billion in grants to small businesses, and an extra $600 a week in unemployment benefits.
Those payments enabled millions of Americans to cover the rent and other bills. Yet those programs are expiring or tailing off. The additional $600 in unemployment ends July 31.
“We could see a huge cliff,” said Julia Pollak, labor economist at ZipRecruiter. “Those expanded benefits will expire before new hiring has really picked up.”
Congress is debating another relief package. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday he supports something that is “much more targeted” to businesses that need it.
Hotels, restaurants, bars and casinos added 2.1 million jobs last month, the most of any industry. Retailers gained 740,000.
While unemployment fell in June for all groups, it dropped faster for whites than for Blacks or Latinos. The rate among white people was 10.1%. Black unemployment fell to 15.4% from 16.8%. Among Latinos, unemployment dropped to 14.5% from 17.6%.
The number of laid-off workers seeking unemployment benefits rose last week in Texas, Arizona and Tennessee. It fell in California, but was near 280,000. That’s more than the number of people who were seeking jobless benefits in the entire country before the outbreak took hold in March.
McDonald’s has paused its reopening efforts nationwide, and Apple is re-closing scores of its stores in the United States. Credit and debit card data tracked by JPMorgan Chase shows that consumers reduced their spending last week after having increased it steadily in late April and May.
Economists have long warned that the economic benefits of allowing businesses to reopen would prove short-lived if the virus wasn’t brought under control and people didn’t feel confident enough to dine out, travel and shop.",2020-07-02T00:00:00Z,2020,3,19

WASHINGTON (AP) — Two months after House Democrats approved a $3 trillion COVID-19 aid package, Senate Republicans are poised to unveil their $1 trillion counteroffer, straining to keep spending in check as the virus outbreak spreads and societal fallout deepens.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is expected to roll out the GOP bill as soon as next week, said Wednesday that he conferred with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin as the White House's point man on the talks prepares to negotiate with Democrats.
But having hit “pause” in May, as McConnell put it, Republicans now face a potentially more dire situation. They had hoped the pandemic would ease and the economic fallout would reverse. Instead, coronavirus cases are spiking, states are resuming shutdowns and parents are wondering if it's safe to send children back to school.
“Regretfully, this is not over,” McConnell said during a visit to a hospital in Kentucky.
“There were some that hoped this would go away sooner than it has,” he said, urging residents to wear masks and social distance.
""The straight talk here that everyone needs to understand: This is not going away,"" McConnell said.
This would be the fifth virus rescue bill since spring, all told an unprecedented federal intervention to counter the times. Unlike any health crisis since the 1918 Spanish flu and an economic upheaval on par with the Great Depression, Congress is trying to engineer a comprehensive national strategy to bring the pandemic under control.
Polling shows Americans are increasingly uneasy over President Donald Trump’s handling of the virus outbreak, and lawmakers are racing to ease the health and economic crises before they, too, face voters in November.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's sweeping $3 trillion coronavirus aid bill, once dismissed by McConnell and others as a liberal wish list, now seems not as far-fetched.
“How many times have we said, ‘We’re at a critical moment'?” Pelosi said Wednesday at the Capitol. “We really are at a critical moment now.”
Both the House and Senate have similar funding priorities — to help schools reopen, provide unemployment benefits for jobless Americans and ramp up health care testing, treatments and a vaccine — but they differ broadly in size and scope.
House Democrats provide $100 billion for school reopenings in an education stabilization fund that Senate Democrats say could swell to $430 billion to include more money for child care, colleges and other educational needs. Senate Republicans are floating some $50 billion to $75 billion in education funds, but talks are still ongoing.
This week, GOP Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, along with Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., the chair of the Health, Education and Labor Committee, proposed child care grants to providers who safely reopen. Similar bills in the past have come with about $25 billion in funding.
The White House this week assured more education dollars would flow as Trump pushes to reopen schools.
""We want schools to be open, and they will be open,"" Trump told reporters Wednesday at the White House, before departing for an event in Georgia.
Trump's advisers are split, with some pushing an even more robust education expenditure, even if it riles Republicans intent on keeping record-setting deficits down. Some conservatives want the education dollars tied to school reopenings or even sent directly to parents, like a school voucher.
The two sides are also divided over how much aid to send to cash-strapped states and cities pleading for money and out-of-work Americans at a time of record-setting unemployment.
Republicans want to discontinue the $600 weekly unemployment boost that expires at the end of the month. They say it's a disincentive to returning to work and want to reduce it to a few hundred dollars a month.
In its place, Republicans are eyeing a return-to-work stipend as well as tax breaks for employers who upgrade workplaces with safety measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
Democrats want to keep the $600 jobless benefit boost, and Pelosi's bill would send nearly $1 trillion to states and cities to shore up budgets and avoid layoffs of municipal workers.
Congress is also considering redirecting some already-approved funds. For example, the popular Paycheck Protection Program of small business loans has leftover funding that could be used for a revamped business loan program from GOP Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida.
One uncertainty is how to improve the nation's poor performance on virus testing.
Both Republicans and Democrats complain that $25 billion in testing funds that were approved in April remain unspent even as certain parts of the country have testing shortages and widespread delays in testing results.
Pelosi's bill provides $75 billion more for virus testing and contact tracing, with directives to the federal government to set up a national testing program. She said Wednesday that it's time for Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act to provide equipment and supplies needed for a testing protocol. Senate Democrats have chronicled the Trump administration's “chaotic” approach and proposed a 26-point testing plan.
Republicans have remained largely silent on how much testing funding will be made available in the new bill. McConnell assured Kentuckians on Wednesday, “We are pursuing testing, treatment and vaccines like the country pursued the Manhattan Project in World War II.”

Editor’s note: These answers are based on interviews and information current as of the time of publication. Please be aware that new information may be discovered by health experts after publication. We’re working to keep this information as up-to-date as possible.
SALT LAKE CITY — Utah crossed the 30,000-case plateau this week as its number of COVID-19 cases remains at the highest rates since the pandemic began.
From its beginning, we’ve asked you, our readers, to submit questions about the coronavirus pandemic to us so we can dig up the answers for you. Here's a look into some statistics, where the spread is happening and answers to other questions you've sent us about the coronavirus.
What are the statistics we should be looking at?
First off, it should be noted that this is an amalgamation of about a half-dozen questions you’ve asked us about various statistics. We combined it into this question.
At the beginning of the pandemic, case counts were an important statistic. But since more than half of Utah’s over 30,000 cases are now considered recovered, that’s not as telling to the current situation as it once was. Instead, Dr. Angela Dunn, the state’s epidemiologist, said it’s important to look at the state’s seven-day rolling average case count.
“We’re now at a point, with this outbreak, where it’s more meaningful to look at the seven-day trends and percent positives of all of our tests,” she explained, during a press briefing last week. “This allows us to really identify meaningful trends in our data, and it decreases the noise from the day-to-day fluctuations we’re seeing.”
As of Tuesday, Utah had a seven-day rolling average of 635.7 cases with a 10.21% positive rate. Those were the average number of new cases and the percentage of positives per test daily in the past week. When placed on a graph, it shows on a better scale if new cases or positive rates of tests are increasing or decreasing.
The data shows exactly how Utah went from a seven-day average of 157 cases on Memorial Day and steadily rose to today's average, which is four times higher. It also shows how the average jumped from 4.9% to 10.2% through the same steady rise.
This, in turn, shows just how active the COVID-19 spread is in Utah now in comparison to what it was on Memorial Day. But it also shows the nuances within the rise that officials can go back and look to see what may have caused a spike or a dip in new cases or positive percentage during a specific time in the pandemic.
We reached out to the Utah Department of Health to see what other stats are important to know. Charla Haley, a spokesperson for the department, said officials are also looking closely at the number of deaths, hospitalizations and demographics of the people getting sick.
“The Utah Department of Health weighs many issues when making recommendations for mitigation efforts,” she said, in an email to KSL.com.
Last week, experts at hospitals explained the current situation at Utah hospitals and what the growing data means for hospitals if it continues. As of Tuesday, the state health department reported 45% capacity for all hospital beds and 65% capacity of intensive care units. That said, experts pointed out that if new cases continue to rise, hospitalizations may soon hit a critical point.
""We’re not making the headway we need to make with the plea to the public to be socially responsible, and it feels as (if) we’re headed for a disaster,"" Dr. Arlen Jarrett, chief medical officer with Steward Healthcare, said Friday. ""It’s very clear that if we stay on this same path, we are going to maximize our hospital capacities very soon.""
The state provides details about demographics on the state health department's website; however, it shows 39% of all cases in Utah involve people aged 25-44, which marks the largest age group for cases. But people aged 45-64 had the highest number of hospitalizations. It also shows an ongoing discrepancy within minority communities, which has been the case for months.
Where is this primarily being spread and contracted?
The state department’s latest map of COVID-19 spread over a 14-day period shows it’s spreading about everywhere in Utah and at high per capita rates — aside from Emery and Carbon counties, which 1 to 5 cases per 100,000 people in those areas combined. Hyrum was also listed in that category by health officials.
The department listed Duchesne County and Daggett and Uintah counties as being “moderate” rate areas over the past two weeks. That’s defined as over 10 to 50 cases per 100,000 people. Parts of central Utah — like Richfield, Monroe and Salina — had “moderately high” rates, which means over 50 to 100 cases per 100,000 people. Morgan County was also listed in that moderately high range.
The rest of the state was considered “high rate” over the past two weeks, which means more than 100 cases per 100,000 residents over that span.
The disease is still predominantly spread through known contacts in household settings. As of Tuesday, known contact with someone with COVID-19 accounts for nearly two-thirds of all Utah cases. And within those cases, contact within the household remains 61% of the causes. Only 13% of cases are attributed to community spread, which has remained constant through the uptick.
You can find recommendations on how to quarantine at home with housemates who are sick here.
Can you tell us city by city, within Salt Lake, what the numbers are?
State health department data does indeed have a breakdown in Salt Lake County. According to Johns Hopkins University data, Salt Lake County entered Tuesday with 40th-most cases of any county in the U.S. As of Tuesday, it has 15,083 cases.
It’s also been well documented already that West Valley City and the western part of Salt Lake City have been hit hard, which has led to measures by state officials to improve communication with individuals in the Latino-Hispanic and Pacific Islander communities.
So what’s the breakdown of all cases in the county through the state health department’s data Tuesday?
- West Valley City: 3,362
- Salt Lake City (all neighborhoods included): 2,946
- West Jordan/Copperton: 1,482
- Sandy: 838
- Taylorsville: 565
- Magna: 548
- Midvale: 515
- South Salt Lake: 512
- Herriman: 510
- Taylorsville/Murray (blended section): 496
- Murray: 494
- South Jordan (including Daybreak): 486
- Millcreek: 370
- Draper: 322
- Riverton/Bluffdale: 300
- Holladay: 236
- Cottonwood Heights: 221
- Other/not listed: 880
This data includes all cases since testing and counting began in March, but all locations in the county were listed as having high COVID-19 case rates over the past two weeks.
Which counties in Utah have had the most deaths?
It’s not surprising that areas with the most cases have the most deaths. For example, Salt Lake County has 49.5% of all cases and 57.5% of all Utah COVID-19 deaths, as of Tuesday. In all, Salt Lake County has reported 130 deaths, followed by Utah County with 29.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention county data lists Box Elder, Cache, Davis, Garfield, Iron, San Juan, Summit, Wasatch, Washington and Weber counties as having fewer than 20 COVID-19 deaths; no deaths have been reported from Utah’s remaining 17 counties, according to CDC data.
Where does the research stand on getting COVID-19 a second time?
This has been addressed in a previous mailbag, but it remains among the top questions we continue to receive. Luckily, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, provided an update on this topic during a conversation with Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, for TIME last week.
The answer remains the same: It’s unknown but unlikely. Fauci said there is no documented scientific case of someone contracting COVID-19, recovering, and then getting it again. He also said it’s not known if a future vaccine will offer long-term protection, or if it will have to be administered yearly like the flu vaccine.
“The idea of relapses — I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s a rare case of an individual who went into remission and relapsed. We saw that in ebola,” Fauci said, referring to the story of Pauline Cafferkey.
“I can say with confidence, that it’s very unlikely that it’s a common phenomenon that people recover (and get sick again),” he continued.
What is a ""known contact""?
We reached out to the state health department for this question as they are the ones providing the statistics.
“Known contact means you are in close contact often with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19. And, in most cases, it means you ‘know’ where you were likely exposed,” Haley said.
What is an effective way to kill the coronavirus?
Assuming this is about cleaning, the Environmental Protection Agency has a guide of 432 cleaning products believed to be strong enough to kill viruses like the virus that causes COVID-19. The list made news last week when two Lysol products were confirmed to have killed the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19.
Those were Lysol Disinfectant Max Cover Mist and Lysol Disinfectant Spray. According to the EPA, both products were able to kill the virus in 2 minutes.
Can I volunteer to help with contact tracing? Can I do it from home?
Haley said the state health department is not currently accepting volunteers for contact tracing. The department is, however, looking to hire Spanish-speaking contact tracers; anyone seeking to apply is encouraged to apply by sending their resume to Janae Duncan at the state health department. Contact tracers do work remotely, according to Haley.
How does a false negative happen, and can a person have COVID-19 in their body but test negative because the concentration of COVID-19 is not very high?
Haley explained that a negative test result means that SARS-CoV-2 was not found in the sample.
“For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms usually means that COVID-19 did not cause your recent illness,” she said, adding that it is possible for an incorrect negative result to happen.
“This means that you might still have COVID-19 even though the test result is negative,” she said. “This can sometimes happen when someone has been exposed but didn't wait at least 7 days after that exposure to get tested.”
When will it be over?
This is likely a question we’ve all thought at least once over the past few months. While the recent surge in Utah and many other states are discouraging, there are signs of hope in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world.
For example, New York City officials on Monday celebrated its first 24-hour period without a death reported in months. That’s not to say COVID-19 is over in New York, but it’s a major moment for an area that was hit hardest when the COVID-19 pandemic first reached the U.S. Several European countries have reported slowdowns in cases as well.
By now, we’re all well aware that a vaccine is one of the more important factors to moving past COVID-19. During Fauci’s TIME interview last week, he pointed out that there were still “multiple candidates” in the vaccine race, and it’s possible that one of the candidates could reach Phase III, or the efficacy phase, by the end of this month. The Associated Press reported Tuesday that a vaccine developed by the National Institutes of Health and Moderna Inc. is slated to begin this phase on July 27.
It’s expected that at least three other candidates will reach that period by the end of October. In all, some 30,000 people are to participate in trials, according to Fauci.
“We hope by the end of this year or by the beginning of 2021, we will at least have an answer whether the vaccine or vaccines, plural, are safe and effective,” he said last week.
While it may take a few more months to have a viable vaccine, Fauci said that the medical field is working with manufacturers to make more doses now even though it’s unclear whether the vaccine works. This aspect is a bit of a gamble. If it’s determined that the vaccine isn’t safe or effective, those doses will have to be destroyed; but it also means if a vaccine is approved, there will be a larger supply of that vaccine to be distributed at that time.
“When we get to the winter and the early part of 2021, we will start to have a large number of doses that people will be able to use if it turns out to be safe and effective,” Fauci said.
That gamble, he added, is a financial risk but not a risk for safety or scientific integrity.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump won’t throw out the first pitch at Yankee Stadium next month after all.
In a tweet Sunday, Trump blamed the turn of events on his “strong focus” on the coronavirus, vaccines and the economy. “We will make it later in the season!” he promised.
Just three days ago, Trump revealed during a White House briefing that he'd throw the first pitch at Yankee Stadium on Aug. 15. Trump made the announcement on Major League Baseball's opening day Thursday as former Yankees pitcher Mariano Rivera watched from the briefing room.
After months of playing down its seriousness, Trump recently began starting to show the public that he is taking the virus seriously. He has resumed holding televised briefings about virus developments and last week canceled Republican convention events that had been set for late August in Jacksonville, Florida. Florida is among several states where the virus is raging.
But on Saturday, the White House tweeted a photo of Trump and former Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre after they played golf at Trump’s private club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
With baseball teams playing in largely empty stadiums, Trump wouldn't have had to contend with crowd reaction to his appearance at the Bronx stadium. Some of Trump's previous appearances at major sporting events have drawn mixed responses.
But another issue could have been tricky for Trump, who has been very critical of athletes taking a knee during the national anthem before games.
The Yankees and the Washington Nationals took a knee before the season's opening game last Thursday in Washington, then stood for the national anthem. New York also had two players kneel for the national anthem Saturday, Aaron Hicks and Giancarlo Stanton. Both have said they will continue to kneel during the anthem throughout the season.
During an interview last Thursday night with Fox News’ Sean Hannity, Trump said he would take part in the prestigious tradition of throwing out the first pitch for the Yankees, but said he hoped players would stand during the national anthem.
“It’s great that baseball is back, and other sports are back. I hope everyone’s standing; I hope they’re not going to be kneeling when the flag is raised. I don’t like to see that,” Trump said.
Some New York City politicians, including Mayor Bill de Blasio and Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr., had complained loudly about Trump throwing the Yankees' first pitch.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Infighting over the White House's handling of the coronavirus pandemic is spilling further into public view, with trade adviser Peter Navarro panning Dr. Anthony Fauci as President Donald Trump stands watch.
Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, called the criticism “nonsense” and “a bit bizarre.”
The long-simmering tiff escalated when Navarro wrote an op-ed in USA Today skewering Fauci, writing that the doctor “has been wrong about everything I have interacted with him on. ... So when you ask me whether I listen to Dr. Fauci’s advice, my answer is: only with skepticism and caution.”
In an interview with The Atlantic, Fauci responded: “I can’t explain Peter Navarro. He’s in a world by himself. So I don’t even want to go there.”
And Trump, who has complained about Fauci privately for months — and publicly in recent days — stepped in to referee.
Navarro “made a state statement representing himself. He shouldn’t be doing that,” Trump told reporters as he departed the White House for Atlanta. The president insisted he had a “very good relationship with Dr. Fauci” and said his staffers were working together.
The back-and-forth is the latest episode of infighting in a White House that has been riven by rivalries since its earliest days. It comes as the White House's handling of the pandemic has come under even deeper scrutiny at a time when cases are surging and the president is pressing to restart economic activity, in part to bolster his reelection chances.
Trump has been known to encourage disputes between aides, believing differing viewpoints serve him better. Others in the White House have waged an open campaign to discredit Fauci, who has been increasingly vocal in his disagreements with the president's enthusiasm for reopening high-risk venues like schools and sporting arenas.
“We’re all on the same team,” Trump said. “We want to get rid of this mess that China sent us. So everybody’s working on the same line and we’re doing very well.”
Still, a person familiar with the matter said Trump himself was amused by the spat, believing Navarro highlighted errors by Fauci and helped reduce his public stature, which has grated on some in the West Wing for months.
One White House official, also speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations, said Navarro had been warned by the White House communications team in recent days to de-escalate his beef with Fauci, but went ahead with the op-ed nonetheless.
White House chief of staff Mark Meadows did not approve the article and is “fully engaged,” according to the official.
“Peter Navarro’s statement or op-ed, whatever you want to classify it as, was an action that is a violation of well-established protocols that was not supported overtly or covertly by anyone in the West Wing,"" Meadows told reporters aboard Air Force One on Wednesday evening. His ""comments really just reflect Peter Navarro’s personal thinking and not the thinking of the West Wing.”
Asked whether Navarro had committed a fireable offense, Meadows said, “I don’t talk about personnel matters.”
Navarro, an economist and China hardliner without public health credentials, did not respond to a request for comment.
The episode was frustrating for some in the White House because it diverted attention from positive developments, like progress on a vaccine, another official said.
Fauci discussed his predicament in a series of interviews with The Atlantic this week.
Asked about the attacks lodged against him by anonymous White House officials, Fauci said he “cannot figure out in my wildest dreams why they would want to do that. I think they realize now that that was not a prudent thing to do, because it’s only reflecting negatively on them.""
As for his relationship with the president, Fauci said it has changed over time. While he used to speak one-on-one with Trump, Fauci said, “I haven’t done that in a while.""
Still, he added that ""a day does not go by that I am not in contact with Debbie Birx, with Bob Redfield, or Steve Hahn and others,” referring to other members of the White House coronavirus task force. ""My input to the president goes through the vice president. But clearly, the vice president — literally every day — is listening to what we have to say, there’s no doubt about that.”
Indeed, in a campaign call with reporters, Vice President Mike Pence came to Fauci's defense, calling him “a valued member of the White House coronavrius task force.”
“We just completed our latest meeting today and we couldn’t be more grateful for his steady counsel as we continue to meet this moment with a whole-of-government approach, a whole-of-America approach,"" Pence said.
Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said on Fox News that Navarro was entitled to his opinion but “I would prefer that he not write it.”
“Everybody’s on the same page,"" Kennedy added. ""I know the vice president thinks the world of Dr. Fauci. Is he right 100% of the time? None of us are.”

The stock market closed out its worst week in more than two months Friday as a second straight day of turbulent trading ended with more losses.
The S&P 500 fell 0.8%, although the index did claw most of the way back from a 3.1% skid earlier in the day. A slide in technology stocks again did much of the damage.
The two-day sell-off came after the S&P 500 set new highs earlier in the week and had its best day in nearly two months. There wasn’t a particular catalyst for continued selling in the high-flying tech sector, but analysts noted that those stocks had posted gigantic gains so far this year that many thought were overdone.
“We had a fast and furious rally at the end of August and we’ve given it back,” said Barry Bannister, head of institutional equity strategy at Stifel. “Investors are like a herd of gazelle on the Serengeti; it doesn’t take much to spook them. They’re alarmed and on the move.”
The selling followed a Labor Department report showing that U.S. hiring slowed to 1.4 million last month, the fewest jobs added since the economy started bouncing back from the initial shock of the pandemic, even as the nation's unemployment rate improved to 8.4% from 10.2%. The U.S. economy has recovered about half the 22 million jobs lost to the pandemic.
The S&P 500 fell 28.10 points to 3,426.96. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 159.42 points, or 0.6%, to 28,133.31. The index had swung sharply during the day, between a loss of as much as 628 points and a gain of as much as 247.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq dropped 144.97 points, or 1.3%, to 11,313.13. The slide added to the index's 5% skid from the day before.
The VIX, a gauge of how much volatility investors expect in the market, has been rising. Even so, traders were not shifting funds into traditional safe-haven assets like U.S. government bonds and precious metals, a sign that the sell-off was not necessarily a reaction to jitters about the economy.
“A lot of people were piling into the (tech) trade and there are a lot of gains to be made,"" said Stephanie Roth, portfolio macro analyst at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. ""This is more an instance of profit-taking, rather than true panic.”
She noted it's not unusual for traders to pocket recent gains ahead of a holiday weekend. U.S. markets will be closed Monday for Labor Day.
The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 0.72%, up from 0.62% late Thursday, a big move. The higher yields helped send financial stocks higher, since banks can lend money at higher rates once yields rise in the bond market. Capital One Financial rose 4.7%
Thursday’s sell-off followed a euphoric rise in recent weeks led by big technology stocks. Investors have been betting technology companies will keep making huge profits as people spend even more time online with their devices during the pandemic, making new market darlings of companies like Zoom Video Communications as many Americans work remotely and students do online learning.
Some of the tech high flyers racked up more losses Friday. Nvidia fell 3%, though the chipmaker is still up more than twofold this year.
Apple was down for much of the day before ending with only a 0.1% gain, Amazon dropped 2.2% and Zoom fell 3%. And yet, Apple is still up 64.8% this year, while Amazon is up 78.3%. And Zoom is up more than 443% for the year. Even with this week's pullback, technology is up 28.8% this year, well ahead of the S&P 500's 10 other sectors.
“The tech gains were so far, so quick that it was almost concerning, so the reversal of that is natural volatility,"" Roth said. “We should expect to see some larger corrections.”
Despite this week's stumble, the S&P 500 is up 6.1% for the year following a five-month comeback from its lows in the spring. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, is up 26.1% for the year. The market's turnaround has been driven by low interest rates, massive amounts of spending on bond purchases by the Federal Reserve and other central banks, and encouraging economic trends as businesses have begun to reopen.
Many investors are also betting that a coronavirus vaccine will arrive later this year and clear the way for a recovery for the economy and corporate profits. Hopes also remain that Congress and the White House will come up with another economic relief package.
“Unless Congress agrees to spend more money to stimulate the economy and close the output gap, it’s very hard for us to grow,” Bannister said.
Stock indexes in Europe fell, shedding early gains. Markets in China also closed broadly lower.

ATLANTA (AP) — Late-stage studies of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate are on temporary hold while the company investigates whether a recipient’s “potentially unexplained” illness is a side effect of the shot.
In a statement issued Tuesday evening, the company said its “standard review process triggered a pause to vaccination to allow review of safety data.”
AstraZeneca didn't reveal any information about the possible side effect except to call it “a potentially unexplained illness.” The health news site STAT first reported the pause in testing, saying the possible side effect occurred in the United Kingdom.
An AstraZeneca spokesperson confirmed the pause in vaccinations covers studies in the U.S. and other countries. Late last month, AstraZeneca began recruiting 30,000 people in the U.S. for its largest study of the vaccine. It also is testing the vaccine, developed by Oxford University, in thousands of people in Britain, and in smaller studies in Brazil and South Africa.
Two other vaccines are in huge, final-stage tests in the United States, one made by Moderna Inc. and the other by Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech. Those two vaccines work differently than AstraZeneca's, and the studies already have recruited about two-thirds of the needed volunteers.
Temporary holds of large medical studies aren't unusual, and investigating any serious or unexpected reaction is a mandatory part of safety testing. AstraZeneca pointed out that it's possible the problem could be a coincidence; illnesses of all sorts could arise in studies of thousands of people.
“We are working to expedite the review of the single event to minimize any potential impact on the trial timeline,” the company statement said.
It’s likely the unexplained illness was serious enough to require hospitalization and not a mild side effect such as fever or muscle pain, said Deborah Fuller, a University of Washington researcher who is working on a different COVID-19 vaccine that has not yet started human testing.
“This is not something to be alarmed about,” Fuller said. Instead, it’s reassuring that the company is pausing the study to figure out what’s happening and carefully monitoring the health of study participants.
Dr. Ashish Jha of Brown University said via Twitter that the significance of the interruption was unclear but that he was “still optimistic” that an effective vaccine will be found in the coming months.
Related:
“But optimism isn’t evidence,” he wrote. “Let’s let science drive this process.”
Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University in New York, tweeted that the illness may be unrelated to the vaccine, ""but the important part is that this is why we do trials before rolling out a vaccine to the general public.”
During the third and final stage of testing, researchers look for any signs of possible side effects that may have gone undetected in earlier patient research. Because of their large size, the studies are considered the most important study phase for picking up less common side effects and establishing safety.
The trials also assess effectiveness by tracking who gets sick and who doesn’t between patients getting the vaccine and those receiving a dummy shot.
The development came the same day that AstraZeneca and eight other drugmakers issued an unusual pledge, vowing to uphold the highest ethical and scientific standards in developing their vaccines.
The U.S. has invested billions of dollars in efforts to quickly develop multiple vaccines against COVID-19. But public fears that a vaccine is unsafe or ineffective could be disastrous, derailing the effort to vaccinate millions of Americans.
Representatives for the FDA did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday evening.
AstraZeneca’s U.S.-traded shares fell more than 6% in after-hours trading following reports of the trial being paused.

MLB-NEWS
Yanks closer Chapman has coronavirus; Astros cancel workout
HOUSTON (AP) — Yankees closer Aroldis Chapman has tested positive for the coronavirus and is experiencing mild symptoms. New York manager Aaron Boone announced the news Saturday. He said Chapman “overall is doing well” but “will not be here for the foreseeable future.” Hours after Chapman’s diagnosis, Yankees slugger Aaron Judge was scratched from a simulated game with a stiff neck. New York is also without infielder DJ LeMahieu and right-hander Luis Cessa due to the virus. The AL East champion Yankees open the season July 23 at Washington.
Chapman threw a bullpen session Tuesday and Boone wouldn’t comment on whether he had been at Yankee Stadium since. Boone said the team had gone through contact tracing protocols, and no other players or personnel would be forced to isolate because of Chapman’s positive test.
In Houston, the Astros canceled their workout after learning that a staff member could have been exposed to a person outside the organization with the coronavirus. It’s the second time this week the Astros have canceled a workout because of concerns about the pandemic. Houston also scrapped its Monday workout because of delays with testing results due to the holiday weekend, as did some other teams around the majors.
In other MLB news:
— Texas Rangers outfielder Joey Gallo says he doesn’t know if he actually had the coronavirus despite two positive tests, since he never had any symptoms and also had multiple negative tests. Gallo said Saturday that he planned to have a more extensive antibody test to be sure after a finger-prick test didn’t indicate that he had COVID-19. The All-Star slugger missed the first week of the Rangers summer camp after two positive tests that sandwiched a negative result during intake testing.
— Cleveland Indians outfielder Delino DeShields Jr. worked out with his teammates at training camp for the first time after being sidelined by the COVID-19 virus. DeShields had suffered some “mild symptoms” after testing positive with the virus before the Indians reported to Cleveland for the re-start of training camp last week. DeShields arrived a few days ago, but he was only cleared Saturday after twice testing negative. DeShields is one of 10 outfielders trying to win a spot on the club’s 30-man roster. He batted .249 and stole 24 bases in 118 games for the Rangers last season.
— Yoenis Céspedes is sure he’ll be ready to start the pandemic-delayed season with the New York Mets. Out of the lineup for almost two years, the 34-year-old slugger said Saturday he finally is close to fully recovered from a string of injuries to his feet and legs. The Mets open at home July 24 against Atlanta. And with the designated hitter available in the National League this year, Céspedes is a prime candidate for that role during a shortened schedule of 60 games. The two-time All-Star missed last season and most of 2018. He had surgery on both heels and then broke his right ankle in a nasty fall at his Florida ranch.
— Arizona Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill has tested positive for COVID-19. The team says after Bidwill developed symptoms, he tested positive and went to the hospital on the recommendation of his doctor. His condition has improved and he’s expected to be released this weekend. The team believes the 55-year-old Bidwill caught the virus while traveling and spending time on the East Coast for several weeks. He’s been working remotely since March and the team says he hasn’t had in-person contact coaches or players.
— Albert Pujols’ 20th season in the majors is about to begin with the Los Angeles Angels. When it does, the 40-year-old slugger is likely to be the oldest player in the big leagues. Although time has chipped away at Pujols’ mountainous talent, he has never believed his advancing age will prevent him from putting up other big numbers on the diamond. His recent years of diminishing overall production have been counterbalanced by still-steady power numbers. They’ve done nothing to hurt his confidence as he heads into this short season with big plans.
NBA-NEWS
LeBron won’t wear social justice message on Lakers jersey
UNDATED (AP) — LeBron James says his thoughts on social justice can’t be contained on the back of a basketball jersey. The Los Angeles Lakers superstar won’t wear one of the NBA-approved social justice messages on the back of his jersey when the NBA resumes competition later this month in the Orlando bubble. As part of the NBA’s recognition of the nationwide invigoration of the social justice movement sparked by the death of George Floyd, NBA players are allowed to choose from a lengthy list of possible messages for their jerseys during the league’s restart. James is among just a few who declined to choose one of the messages, he said.
Elsewhere in the NBA:
— San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich says he had some reservations about being at the NBA restart at the Disney complex near Orlando, Florida. But after talks with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and others, he decided it would be smart and safe to be with the Spurs for the resumption of the season. Popovich says it’s about more than basketball. He points to how the league can help make changes in society by raising awareness to social causes and a need to combat racism.
VIRUS OUTBREAK-SPORTS
PAC-12 shifts to conference-only
UNDATED (AP) — The Pac-12 has become the second major conference to shift to a conference-only fall schedule amid growing concerns over the coronavirus pandemic. The decision covers football, women’s and women’s soccer and women’s volleyball. Conference-only schedules will be announced no later than July 31. The announcement came a day after the Big Ten opted to eliminate nonconference games for all fall sports. The Atlantic Coast, Big 12 and Southeastern conferences are still weighing options for fall sports.
In other developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic:
— Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott has tested positive for COVID-19. The 55-year-old tested positive late this week after experiencing flu-like symptoms and is self-quarantining at the direction of his doctor, according to a statement by the conference. Scott is continuing to carry on his duties as commissioner remotely.
— San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich, the U.S. men’s basketball coach, says he is watching how Japan is handling the coronavirus. Popovich says he hopes the Tokyo Games, which were delayed until 2021, could still happen — especially if a vaccine or other remedies are developed beforehand. The NBA plans to start next season in December, which could complicate Olympic availability for players. It’s not clear if the playoffs would be finished before the Olympics would begin on July 23, 2021.
— Scott Dixon earned his third straight victory Saturday with an improbable triumph in the opening race of a weekend doubleheader at Road America, as IndyCar welcomed fans to its races for the first time this season. Dixon has won each of the three IndyCar races to take place thus far during this pandemic-delayed season. He’s the first IndyCar driver to start a season with at least three consecutive victories since Sebastien Bourdais reeled off four straight to start the 2006 campaign.
PGA-WORKDAY RESULTS
Thomas keeps clean card for 2-shot lead at Muirfield Village
DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) — Justin Thomas went from a three-shot deficit to a two-shot lead in the Workday Charity Open. Thomas had a third consecutive round without bogeys, this one a 66. He made birdies early to keep pace with Collin Morikawa. When Morikawa fell back, Thomas added three birdies to hold off Viktor Hovland. The Norwegian star also had a 66. The final round is a glimpse of golf’s next generation. All three will be in the final group because of an early start to avoid storms. The round needs to finish Sunday to have a day to get ready for the Memorial.
NHRA-RESUMES
NHRA resumes season, Johnson tops Funny Car qualifying
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Tommy Johnson Jr. topped Funny Car qualifying Saturday at the NHRA Nationals in the series’ return from a more than four-month break because of the coronavirus pandemic. Johnson, the winner in the last race before competition was suspended, had a 3.983-second run at 317.72 mph in a Dodge Charger in front of a limited number of fans at Lucas Oil Raceway.
Steve Torrence led in Top Fuel, Jason Line in Pro Stock and Eddie Krawiec in Pro Stock Motorcycle. Torrence had a 3.779 at 321.19, Line ran a 6.626 at 206.10 in a Chevrolet Camaro, and Krawiec had a 6.897 at 196.24 on a Harley-Davidson.
The NHRA resumed its season Saturday in front of an expected crowd of 3,000 to 4,000 at Lucas Oil Raceway in Indianapolis. NHRA President Glen Cromwell said ticket sales were capped at about 10 to 15% of normal capacity. They also are expected to attend Sunday’s finals. Most fans wore face coverings on a hot, sun-drenched day, complying with county guidelines, and observed social distancing in the stands, pits and at concession areas.
The weekend ends a 138-day hiatus for America’s top drag racing series.
NHL-PLAYERS OUT
Stars’ Polak, Canucks’ Baertschi won’t report to NHL camps
UNDATED (AP) — Edmonton’s Mike Green and Vancouver’s Sven Baertschi are opting out. Dallas defenseman Roman Polak isn’t reporting for now. And Tampa Bay captain Steven Stamkos isn’t reporting at full strength.
Green and Baertschi joined Calgary defenseman Travis Hamonic in choosing not to participate in the resumption of the NHL season. Polak is not on the Stars’ roster for the start of training camp, and a team spokesman said the 34-year-old won’t be attending at this time.
Green, like Hamonic, decided not to play for family reasons. The Calgary Flames defenseman's daughter was hospitalized last year with respiratory issues, and he and his wife also have a baby boy.
The Tampa Bay Lightning won’t have captain Steven Stamkos at 100% for the opening of camp because of a lower-body injury, but they’re optimistic he’ll be ready when games get under way in early August.
The Minnesota Wild, who face the Canucks in the qualifying round, have ruled out defenseman Greg Pateryn indefinitely with an upper-body injury.
NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said Saturday the league will be taking over injury and illness disclosure from teams as a way of protecting player privacy.
In other NHL news:
— The NHL and the players union are credited for putting aside past differences in taking a collaborative approach in ratifying a return-to-play plan that also includes the assurance of labor peace through September 2026. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman described the months-long negotiations as unprecedented in how the two sides addressed the wide variety of concerns and challenges raised after placing the season on pause in March because of the new coronavirus pandemic. NHL Players’ Association chief Don Fehr said the pandemic forced both sides to work in “common spirit” in order to salvage what’s left of the season.
—NHL Games are scheduled to begin Aug. 1 in Toronto and Edmonton, Alberta. Coronavirus cases in the U.S. are pushing the league into Canada for the summer and fall until the Stanley Cup is awarded in late September or early October.
HORSE RACING-ART COLLECTOR
Art Collector takes the Blue Grass at Keeneland
LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) — Art Collector took a big step toward the Kentucky Derby, pulling away from the filly Swiss Skydiver in the stretch in the Blue Grass at Keeneland for his first graded stakes victory.
The Kentucky-bred son of Bernardini and Distorted Legacy by Distorted Humor started the $600,000, Grade 2 event from the No. 3 post and battled Shivaree and Swiss Skydiver to the far turn. Rushie joined the chase at the final turn, but before Art Collector and Swiss Skydiver separated themselves from the 13-horse field. The two ran side by side before Art Collector took control at the 1/8th pole in the 3½-lengths win.
Art Collector improved to 3-0 this year and has four wins and a second in eight starts. The colt collected 100 points toward the 146th Derby on Sept. 5 at Churchill Downs.
PALACE IMPLOSION
Pistons’ onetime home, the Palace of Auburn Hills, torn down
AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) — One of Michigan’s most beloved sports and entertainment venues was turned into rubble on Saturday with a series of controlled explosions.
The shell and roof of the Palace of Auburn Hills, which was home to three championship Detroit Pistons teams and three Detroit Shock teams and played host to some of the world’s biggest musical acts during its nearly 30-year run, crumbled to the ground following a series explosive pops. The rest of the arena had already been removed.
The Palace, which opened in 1988, held more than 22,000 people for NBA games and up to 23,000 for concerts and other shows, according to nba.com.
After the Pistons relocated in 2017 to downtown Detroit, the arena about 30 miles northwest of the city continued to host concerts and music events, the last in September 2017 by rocker Bob Seger.
It also became the second suburban Detroit arena that found little real use after its main sports tenant took its games back to the city. The Detroit Lions played at the nearby Pontiac Silverdome from 1975-2001 before moving to Ford Field in Detroit. The Pistons also called the Silverdome home for a decade before The Palace opened. The Silverdome was taken down with a partial implosion in 2017.
OBIT-JACK CHARLTON
England World Cup winner Jack Charlton dies at 85
UNDATED (AP) — England World Cup winner Jack Charlton has died.
Charlton was an uncompromising central defender who played alongside his brother, Bobby, in England’s World Cup-winning side in 1966 before enjoying coaching success with Ireland. Charlton was Footballer of the Year in England in 1967. He spent all his club career at Leeds from 1952-73, tying its all-time record of 773 appearances. He won every domestic honor, including the league title in 1969. His biggest achievement came with the England national team that beat Germany 4-2 after extra time in the 1966 World Cup final at Wembley Stadium.
Charlton died at home on Friday in his native Northumberland in northeast England. He was 85.
Premier League games will be preceded by a minute’s silence this weekend as a tribute to Charlton and players will wear black armbands.
TENNIS-SUSPICIOUS MATCHES
Tennis Integrity Unit eyes suspicious exhibition matches
LONDON (AP) — The Tennis Integrity Unit has raised concerns over 24 “suspicious matches” at exhibitions organized while the men’s and women’s tours are shut down amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The TIU, which investigates match-fixing cases in the sport, said Friday it received reports of the matches at private tournaments staged between April and June.
The reports are filed by gambling companies who track unusual betting patterns around matches. Suspicious betting patterns don’t necessarily mean a match was fixed. A similar effect can also happen if insider information about a player’s injury leaks.
Private tennis exhibitions have proliferated after the ATP and WTA tours closed down in March. Some have little or no oversight. Besides a smattering of events with big-name players, there are many smaller events around the world with low-ranked players.

CHICAGO (AP) — A false report claiming five Ukrainians had died after taking an American-made coronavirus vaccine spread in just a matter of days from a small Kremlin-friendly website to an audience of thousands in U.S.-based Facebook groups.
Russian media outlets picked up the claim, and soon social media users in the U.S. were sharing screenshots and links to those articles — all as 30,000 Americans were preparing to roll up their sleeves for shots of an experimental COVID-19 vaccine late last month.
The fast dissemination of a single report from an obscure Ukrainian website to crowds of Facebook users highlights the ease with which pro-Russian websites can feed misinformation into American internet circles. In fact, one of the websites that picked up the report was identified by the U.S. State Department this week as being part of a network of proxy misinformation websites being used by the Russian government.
As various countries race to produce a successful coronavirus vaccine, disinformation experts are bracing for a steady drum of misleading claims and propaganda aimed at undermining competing countries’ efforts to develop an antidote. Misinformation could raise distrust and fear around a vaccine, threatening government leaders’ hopes of ending the pandemic. And the U.S., which is readying plans to deliver 300 million doses to Americans starting next year, if a successful vaccine is identified, could be a prime target.
The falsehood around the U.S. vaccine fits into a longstanding, pro-Kremlin misinformation strategy, said Bret Schafer, a disinformation fellow at the Alliance for Securing Democracy.
“Anytime it appears the West has taken the lead in something they’re going to try to do damage,” Schafer said. “As they’re close to coming to market with their own vaccine, or start running trials, you create doubt about what everyone else is doing in the hopes that your own citizens look to you for the answers.”
Russia is boasting that it will soon become the first country to approve a COVID-19 vaccine. But scientists are raising serious doubts the country’s plans to start mass vaccinations as soon as October.
The unsupported claim that five out of 15 Ukrainians had died during a trial of the U.S. coronavirus vaccine was first published in July on the Lugansk Media Centre, a website affiliated with the separatist rebels in Ukraine’s Luhansk region, who are backed by Russia. The false report said eight others also were hospitalized. The vaccine, however, is not currently being tested in Ukraine, according to a global database of vaccine trials kept by both the World Health Organization and U.S. National Institutes of Health.
Lugansk Media Centre did not return a request for comment.
The report was picked up by Russian-friendly site NewsFront and was shared more than 20,000 times in public Facebook groups and pages, including several with large anti-vaccination followings in the U.S.
NewsFront was identified as a “proxy website” for the Russian government in a State Department’s report this week that detailed Russia’s apparatus of state-funded media, social media accounts and English-language websites used to spread disinformation.
“Vaccines are never safe!” one Facebook user wrote, sharing the NewsFront article in a Florida-based Facebook group called Vaxxed Vaccine Information.
The claim also gained traction in U.S. and French-speaking QAnon Facebook groups, which promote the conspiracy theory that President Donald Trump is waging a secret campaign against enemies in the “deep state” and a child sex trafficking ring.
And it appears to have inspired a new wave of memes aimed at sowing doubt about the vaccine.
“Just curious. Would you take a vaccine with a 33% death rate to feel safe from a virus with a .06% death rate?” asks one meme that has been shared 14,000 times in a single Facebook post.
Facebook did not return a request for comment.
The reach of the misinformation was “definitely a success” for the Lugansk Media Centre, a fringe site that has generated little traction with its articles in the past but has been working to build its profile, said Elise Thomas, a researcher at the International Cyber Policy Centre in Australia.
Thomas said that could encourage fringe and propaganda websites to test out more online falsehoods in the coming months as scientists enter into the final stages of testing vaccine candidates.
“They fully understand that the vaccine is a hot topic,” said Thomas, who tracked the claim’s origin online. “That’s probably what we’re going to see in the next coming months.”

SALT LAKE CITY — Anyone who has followed COVID-19 trends in recent weeks probably has noticed there’s been another uptick in cases reported in Utah.
The Beehive State’s epidemiological curve showed deceleration near the tail end of July following what had been its highest reported case numbers to date. That uptick came shortly after Memorial Day after the state had experienced a plateau in new cases for weeks prior to the holiday.
A steady decline from the post-Memorial Day uptick began July 18 and through mid-August before it, too, hit a plateau with some slight increases. But now that epidemiological curve is moving back up again since the last reported case decline on Aug. 18.
It begs the question: What’s driving the state’s latest rise in cases?
Here’s what the data tells us.
Younger people are driving up COVID-19 cases — even more than before
We’ve known some of this already. Utah, which has the youngest average population in the country, has dealt with younger people driving COVID-19 cases with older individuals and those with certain conditions generally suffering the worst consequences. That’s not to say it’s been the case all the time.
Utahns aged 25 to 44 still make up the most cases of any other age range. Now six months into the pandemic, those within the category account for 21,681 cases, or about 37%, as of Tuesday.
Those younger than 25 are starting to pile up new case counts, which was feared to be the case when both K-12 and higher education schools returned beginning in August and continuing in September. Utahns aged 15 to 24 now account for the second-highest number of cases with 14,805 total, about a quarter of the state’s total since March. Individuals aged 1 to 14 account for 4,117 cases, or 7% of the total, and those under 1 account for just 241 cases.
The divide between younger individuals and older individuals has widened in recent weeks. On top of that, hospitalizations are starting to increase as well for younger individuals compared to the beginning of the pandemic.
How do we know that? Using an internal database of the state health department’s daily information, we compared age-range data from three key dates: May 28 (the start of Utah’s first major uptick), July 18 (the start of the decline period from that uptick) and the current tally as of Tuesday. We also removed children under 1 for this segment because it was a small statistical figure.
Regarding cases, Utahns aged 1 to 44 accounted for about 62% of all Utah cases on May 28. The figure moved up to 67% of all cases on July 18 and now accounts for nearly 69% of cases to date. That tells us those within the 1 to 44 age range are outpacing those 45 and over from May 28 to now.
It’s the data within individual ages that shows exactly how it’s happening. Every group experienced upticks in cases from May 28 to July 18, as the state’s total cases from March until then more than tripled. From a percentage increase standpoint, here’s how each cohort increased from July 18 through Tuesday’s numbers:
- Ages 1-14: 84.9% (1,890 new cases)
- Ages 15-24: 105.4% (7,598 new cases)
- Ages 25-44: 68.3% (8,800 new cases)
- Ages 45-64: 66.1% (5,446 new cases)
- Ages 65-84: 73% (1,683 new cases)
- Ages 85+: 52.9% (164 new cases)
In fact, those within the 15 to 24 age range account for the most new cases if you start back to a month ago Tuesday. That age group accounted for 4,285 new cases in that span, with 25- to 44-year-olds second after that, accounting for 4,070 new cases.
As for COVID-19 cases from the start of the pandemic, Utahns aged 15 to 24 surpassed 45- to 64-year-olds as the second-highest group in total count on Sept. 4. The 1 to 14 age group moved past the 65 to 84 age group as the fourth-largest group last month.
With ages 15 to 24 rising at the highest rates, it’s no surprise that schools are partly the reason for the increase. The state health department has reported 47 outbreaks attributed to schools from Aug. 15 through Tuesday, including eight this week. The outbreaks have resulted in 290 total cases with a median age of 16 years old and nine total hospitalizations.
School outbreaks now moved to the second most common place for outbreaks that were not in long-term facilities, well behind workplaces, which experienced a rise of outbreaks after COVID-19 restrictions were eased back in May. As of Tuesday, there have now been 721 workplaces outbreaks resulting in 4,879 cases, 204 hospitalizations and 15 deaths. The median outbreak case age is 38.
During a media briefing about a new website that shows the state’s goals with COVID-19 data, Utah Department of Health interim executive director Rich Saunders said the state considered setting up a goal of a seven-day running average set at 300 or 350 new cases per day but decided to keep it at 400 to account for schools reopening. It’s jumped from 381.6 cases per day on Sept. 9 to 522.1 new cases per day as of Tuesday.
In a different press briefing last week, Gov. Gary Herbert said he expected outbreaks at schools would result in a review of COVID-19 quarantine procedures for schools up until a vaccine is available. He added that he was concerned that individuals — regardless of age — would become complacent regarding protective measures.
The data also demonstrates that those 45 and older disproportionately experience the worst outcomes of the coronavirus. Indeed, Utah Department of Health data shows those 45 and older may just account for 30.8% of cases, but 66% of hospitalizations and 95.6% of deaths. This explains why the health department reports Utah’s average hospitalization age is 53 and the average mortality age is 73.
In terms of hospitalizations, the numbers are lower for younger age ranges but they slowly are increasing — and at rates higher than older ages in some cases. From a percentage increase standpoint, here’s how hospitalizations have increased from July 18 through Tuesday’s numbers:
- Ages 1-14: 138.9% (25 new hospitalizations)
- Ages 15-24: 78.6% (103 new hospitalizations)
- Ages 25-44: 70% (324 new hospitalizations)
- Ages 45-64: 60% (463 new hospitalizations)
- Ages 65-84: 73.1% (374 new hospitalizations)
- Ages 85+: 63.6% (49 new hospitalizations)
In a world where people of all age ranges will bump into each other inside and outside of the home, cases and outbreaks involving younger individuals do carry the risk of getting other individuals sick. A Centers for Disease Control study published Friday used three child care outbreaks in Utah as an example of the risks. It found 12 children caught COVID-19 at facilities and spread it to 12 of 46 parents or siblings, resulting in a hospitalization of a parent.
""COVID-19 is less severe in children than it is in adults, but children can still play a role in transmission,"" the report stated. ""The infected children exposed at these three facilities had mild to no symptoms. Two of three asymptomatic children likely transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to their parents and possibly to their teachers.""
A rise in Utah County
Since the pandemic reached Utah, we’ve seen certain areas affected worse than others. Salt Lake County remains the leader for most total cases, but hotspots have emerged in places like Summit, San Juan and Cache counties. Utah County is now where an extraordinary rise is underway, and it has even topped Salt Lake County in new cases a few times since September despite having nearly half the population.
On Monday, Dr. Angela Dunn, the state’s epidemiologist, pointed out that 39% of all of the state’s new cases from Friday through Monday were reported in Utah County, even though the county represents 20% of the state’s overall population. She also pointed to younger individuals in the county driving up the number.
""Most of these cases are among 14-24-year-olds, and the majority of those are among college-aged young adults,"" she said, in a statement. ""Colleges across the state, and specifically in Utah County, have acted proactively to implement solid prevention measures on their campuses. They need help from their students to act responsibly while off-campus. What students do off-campus has a direct impact on a school's ability to safely operate their campus.""
Utah County accounted for 6,356 cases by July 18, when the state began its nearly month-long decline in cases. That was about 18.6% of the 34,249 cases in the state at the time. The county has since doubled its total case counts to 13,528, as of Tuesday. The state has reported 24,751 new cases since July 18, with Utah County reporting about 29% of those new cases.
How does it compare to Salt Lake County? While Salt Lake County has had nearly 3,000 more cases over the span of close to the past two months, Utah County has experienced a much larger rate increase. Its COVID-19 counts rose 112.8% in that time while Salt Lake County’s rose 60.3%.
Other places have also experienced upticks in this two-month span, though perhaps not as noticeable as Utah County’s. For example, Davis County has almost doubled its COVID-19 cases over the past two months, jumping from a total of 2,338 cases to 4,440. That’s an increase of nearly 90%. The Weber-Morgan Health Department also reported an 83.2% increase from July 18 through Tuesday, which is a jump from 2,077 cases to 3,805.
In all, the local health departments along the Wasatch Front account for 86.5% of the cases from July 18 through Tuesday. Other population hubs, like the Southwest Utah Public Health Department (reporting another 1,431 new cases, 5.8%) and the Bear River Health Department (accounting for 933 new cases, 3.8%) also added to the rise in cases since July 18.
Perhaps more troubling, the state’s seven-day running average of positive test percentage reached 10.6% through Sept. 9. It’s still relatively low compared to other states but it is the highest it has been since the pandemic began, according to state health department data. After the decline, it had reached as low as 8.2% on Aug. 17.
The data shows the coronavirus hasn’t really gone anywhere six months later.

SALT LAKE CITY — The volume of out-of-work Utahns filing for financial assistance is continuing at a historic pace.
The Utah Department of Workforce Services reported Thursday the number of new claims for unemployment benefits registered at 5,006 for the week of June 21 to June 27 — a 1% increase over last week. A total 83,959 weekly claims were processed during the one-week period with claimants receiving $23.7 million in traditional jobless payments, along with an additional $45.7 million of $600 federal weekly stimulus monies distributed, as well as $1.4 million in federally funded extended benefits for an overall total of nearly $71 million in benefits for the week.
“The unemployment insurance program has been an incredible stabilizer for those that have and continue to see disruption to their employment as we move towards economic recovery,” said Kevin Burt, director of the state’s Unemployment Insurance Division. “However, the stability found in unemployment is temporary and about to change dramatically with the loss of the $600 weekly stimulus at the end of July. We continue to encourage claimants to seek ongoing stability in the many job opportunities currently available.”
The office reported the industries with the highest percentage of weekly claims this week were office and administrative support at 12.2%, management occupations at 9.4% and production jobs at 8.8%. The counties in the Beehive State registering the highest number of Utahns filing new unemployment insurance claims were Salt Lake County at 38.7%, Utah County at 13.6%, Weber County at 7.9%, Davis County at 7.6% and Washington County at 5.3%.
“It’s clear this pandemic is impacting a lot of people still with unemployment in Utah, and the unemployment insurance to date has paid out $905 million in unemployment benefits to those that have been found eligible,” Burt said. “While some industries continue to struggle, what we need to do is connect the job seekers that were working in industries that may be struggling to these other industries that seem to be doing well and are hiring. We hope that this number continues to trend down on the continued claims, especially with the $600 stimulus only being available for four more weeks.”
He noted that approximately one third of the monies used to pay claimants’ benefits is paid through the state’s Unemployment Trust Fund — which is subsidized through taxes collected from Utah employers. Prior to the pandemic Utah’s trust fund was ranked the seventh healthiest in the nation and was estimated to last about 18 months without collecting any more taxes, he explained during a weekly news conference.
“Right now, we are about in month four with the unemployment insurance benefits really being impacted, (but) we’re not concerned about the solvency of the trust fund this year,” he said. However, if distributions continue at the current pace, there could be a time in the long-term future where it could potentially be affected, he added.
Meanwhile, the impact the pandemic is having on Utah’s once robust economy has been significant. A local analyst said the ongoing trend of exceptionally high jobless filings is putting a strain on the economy, but there are signs of optimism with more Utahns returning to their old employers or finding new jobs as COVID-19 related restrictions are slowly being lifted.
“There’s some good things to take away from this in that we’re starting to open up things a little bit (and) some people are back to work,” said Andrew Keinsley, assistant professor of economics at Weber State University. “But there’s a long road ahead, for sure.”
He said with so much uncertainty surrounding when or if the coronavirus outbreak will be contained or a vaccine made available, determining a timeframe for economic recovery in Utah or nationwide is nearly impossible to gauge right now.
“The lockdowns were an attempt to mitigate the issues of the virus, but the virus is still out there. As long as we keep seeing these spikes (and) if we don’t get this under control, people are going to be afraid to go out,” Keinsley said. “They’re not going to want to go to restaurants, they’re not going to want to travel, they’re not going to want to do a lot of (activities), and that’s going to keep the unemployment high and that’s going to keep the economy kind of slowly chugging along instead of bouncing back like we hoped it would.”
He also expressed concern about the impact the pandemic is having on state and local budgets. Hearkening back to the 2008 recession, that slowdown caused huge decreases in tax revenue at state and local levels, which forced budget cuts and massive layoffs.
“That was a big drag on the overall (national) economy because we saw this in every state,” he said. “Right now, when I look out there, I don’t see any reason to think that’s not going to happen again.”
However, while he believes the worst of the downturn may already be behind us, there will be bumps along the way to eventual economic recovery.
“We’re going to see a lot of “stop and go” types of dynamics where we start to open up, we get a little bit of a spike, then we kind of slow it down a little bit,” Keinsley said. “There’s just a lot of uncertainty out there and that’s going to be the thing that really holds us back.”",2020-07-02T00:00:00Z,2020,3,19

NEW DELHI (AP) — The worldwide death toll from the coronavirus eclipsed 1 million on Tuesday, nine months into a crisis that has devastated the global economy, tested world leaders’ resolve, pitted science against politics, and forced multitudes to change the way they live, learn and work.
“It’s not just a number. It’s human beings. It’s people we love,” said Dr. Howard Markel, a professor of medical history at the University of Michigan who has advised government officials on containing pandemics and lost his 84-year-old mother to COVID-19 in February.
“It’s our brothers, our sisters. It’s people we know,” he added. “And if you don’t have that human factor right in your face, it’s very easy to make it abstract.”
The bleak milestone, recorded by Johns Hopkins University, is greater than the population of Jerusalem or Austin, Texas. It is 2 1/2 times the sea of humanity that was at Woodstock in 1969. It is more than four times the number killed in the 2004 earthquake and tsunami in the Indian Ocean.
Even then, the figure is almost certainly a vast undercount because of inadequate or inconsistent testing and reporting and suspected concealment by some countries.
And the number continues to mount. Nearly 5,000 deaths are reported each day on average. Parts of Europe are getting hit by a second wave, and experts fear the same fate may await the U.S., which accounts for about 205,000 deaths, or 1 out of 5 worldwide. That is far more than any other country, despite America's wealth and medical resources.
“I can understand why ... numbers are losing their power to shock, but I still think it’s really important that we understand how big these numbers really are,” said Mark Honigsbaum, author of “The Pandemic Century: One Hundred Years of Panic, Hysteria and Hubris.”
The global toll includes people like Joginder Chaudhary, who was his parents’ greatest pride, raised with the little they earned farming a half-acre plot in central India to become the first doctor from their village.
After the virus killed the 27-year-old Chaudhary in late July, his mother wept inconsolably. With her son gone, Premlata Chaudhary said, how could she go on living? Three weeks later, on Aug. 18, the virus took her life, too. All told, it has killed more than 95,000 in India.
“This pandemic has ruined my family,” said the young doctor's father, Rajendra Chaudhary. “All our aspirations, our dreams, everything is finished.”
When the virus overwhelmed cemeteries in the Italian province of Bergamo last spring, the Rev. Mario Carminati opened his church to the dead, lining up 80 coffins in the center aisle. After an army convoy carted them to a crematory, another 80 arrived. Then 80 more.
Eventually, the crisis receded and the world’s attention moved on. But the pandemic’s grasp endures. In August, Carminati buried his 34-year-old nephew.
“This thing should make us all reflect. The problem is that we think we’re all immortal,” the priest said.
The virus first appeared in late 2019 in patients hospitalized in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the first death was reported on Jan. 11. By the time authorities locked down the city nearly two weeks later, millions of travelers had come and gone. China’s government has come in for criticism that it did not do enough to alert other countries to the threat.
Government leaders in countries like Germany, South Korea and New Zealand worked effectively to contain it. Others, like U.S. President Donald Trump and Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, dismissed the severity of the threat and the guidance of scientists, even as hospitals filled with gravely ill patients.
Brazil has recorded the second most deaths after the U.S., with about 142,000. India is third and Mexico fourth, with more than 76,000.
The virus has forced trade-offs between safety and economic well-being. The choices made have left millions of people vulnerable, especially the poor, minorities and the elderly.
With so many of the deaths beyond view in hospital wards and clustered on society’s margins, the milestone recalls the grim pronouncement often attributed to Soviet dictator Josef Stalin: One death is a tragedy, millions of deaths are a statistic.
The pandemic’s toll of 1 million dead in such a limited time rivals some of the gravest threats to public health, past and present.
It exceeds annual deaths from AIDS, which last year killed about 690,000 people worldwide. The virus’s toll is approaching the 1.5 million global deaths each year from tuberculosis, which regularly kills more people than any other infectious disease.
But “COVID’s grip on humanity is incomparably greater than the grip of other causes of death,” said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University. He noted the unemployment, poverty and despair caused by the pandemic, and deaths from myriad other illnesses that have gone untreated.
For all its lethality, the virus has claimed far fewer lives than the so-called Spanish flu, which killed an estimated 40 million to 50 million worldwide in two years, just over a century ago.
That pandemic came before scientists had microscopes powerful enough to identify the enemy or antibiotics that could treat the bacterial pneumonia that killed most of the victims. It also ran a far different course. In the U.S., for example, the Spanish flu killed about 675,000. But most of those deaths did not come until a second wave hit over the winter of 1918-19.
Up to now, the disease has left only a faint footprint on Africa, well shy of early modeling that predicted thousands more deaths.
But cases have recently surged in countries like Britain, Spain, Russia and Israel. In the United States, the return of students to college campuses has sparked new outbreaks. With approval and distribution of a vaccine still probably months away and winter approaching in the Northern Hemisphere, the toll will continue to climb.
“We’re only at the beginning of this. We’re going to see many more weeks ahead of this pandemic than we’ve had behind us,” Gostin said.

TOKYO (AP) — Tokyo Olympics officials are proposing that the government relax immigration regulations to allow athletes to enter the country before next year's postponed games and train during a 14-day quarantine period, Toshiro Muto, the CEO of the organizing committee said on Wednesday.
“We have to consider the uniqueness of the athletes and also their activities,"" Muto said, speaking in Japanese following a meeting of a task force considering countermeasures against the COVID-19 pandemic.
The International Olympic Committee, Tokyo city and national government officials, and members of the organizing committee are holding virtual meetings on Thursday and Friday focused on finding ways to hold the delayed Olympics during a pandemic.
The organizing committee and the IOC have said for months they are considering many scenarios for how the games can open on July 23, 2021, but have offered nothing specific.
IOC President Thomas Bach, who will address the online meetings on Thursday, has said a vaccine and rapid testing would help, but added there is no “silver bullet” that will allow the Olympics to automatically happen.
Bach and new Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga spoke for 15 minutes on Wednesday, the foreign ministry said. They talked about pulling off the games, and Bach said he hoped to soon visit Japan.
Muto summed up dealing with so many disparate and often competing interests representing 15,400 Olympic and Paralympic athletes, officials, coaches, sponsors — not to mention the question of Japanese and foreign fans.
“How we are going to decide is something we have to decide,” Muto said. “But we haven't discussed by when we have to decide.”
Muto said a report would be forthcoming in December, after talks with the IOC, national Olympic committees, sports federations and myriad other parties including broadcasters, athletes, sponsors and medical officials.
He acknowledged that athletes might have to use public transportation in Japan, suggesting a complete “bubble” would be impossible.
And he raised the issue of how the pandemic is at very different stages in many countries — as is testing. Athletes would be expected to be tested before they leave home, and then be tested again in Japan.
“Depending on the country, the reliability of the testing is still an issue,” he said. “The accuracy of the tests may not be uniform.""
Left unsaid so far is an official estimate of what the one-year delay will cost. Most estimates suggest several billion dollars, most of which falls to Japanese taxpayers.
The two-day meetings come the same week that the Japanese media reported again on the bribery scandal tied to the Tokyo Olympics. It forced the resignation last year of Japanese Olympic Committee President Tsunekazu Takeda.
The University of Oxford also released a study last week saying that Tokyo is the most expensive Summer Olympics on record.
Japan has recorded about 1,500 deaths from COVID-19, much lower per capita than the United States, Brazil, or India.

SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea has reported 25 newly confirmed cases of COVID-19, bringing its national caseload to 14,175 infections and 299 deaths.
South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday said 16 of the new cases were tied to people arriving from abroad. The country in past days have reported dozens of cases among crew members of a Russia-flagged cargo ship docked in the southern port of Busan and hundreds of South Korean construction workers airlifted from virus-ravaged Iraq.
Among the nine local transmissions, eight were from the Seoul metropolitan area, which has been at the center of a virus resurgence since late May. Health authorities have scrambled to stem transmissions linked to various places and groups, including churches, welfare centers, restaurants and door-to-door salespeople.

BEIJING — China on Monday reported 61 new confirmed cases of coronavirus, spread between its northeastern and northwestern regions. The Xinjiang region in the northwest reported 41 new cases, while Liaoning and Jilin provinces in the northeast saw a combined total of 16. Another four cases were brought by Chinese travelers from outside the country. No new deaths were reported, leaving the toll from COVID-19 in the country at 4,634 among 83,891 cases. A total of 339 people are receiving treatment for the disease, 21 of them in serious condition, while 305 people are being monitored in isolation for showing signs of infection or for having tested positive for the virus without showing symptoms.
The latest outbreaks come as most of the country is opening up, with major cities restarting indoor recreation venues and sporting events, albeit without fans in attendance.
Xinjiang’s outbreak has been focused on its largest city of Urumqi, where case numbers have approached 200 over the last two weeks.

MELBOURNE, Australia: Australia’s hard-hit Victoria state on Monday posted a new daily record of 532 new COVID-19 cases, and the government leader warned that a lockdown in the city of Melbourne would continue while infected people continued to go to work.
Melbourne is almost half way through a six-week lockdown aimed at curbing community spread of coronavirus. Mask-wearing in Australia’s second-largest city became compulsory last week.
The new cases and six deaths reported on Monday surpasses a previous record of 484 new infections reported on Wednesday last week.
Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said the biggest driver of the new infections was people continuing to go to work after showing symptoms.
“This is what is driving these numbers up and the lockdown will not end until people stop going to work with symptoms and instead go and get tested,” Andrews said.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison called for patience in Victoria.
“There has been significant community transmission in Victoria. That will take some time to get on top of,” Morrison said.

MANILA, Philippines — Vietnam has postponed its hosting of Asia’s largest security forum, which includes North Korea, and an annual meeting of Southeast Asian foreign ministers by a month to September due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Two Southeast Asian diplomats said Monday that Vietnam, which leads the Association of Southeast Asian Nations this year, hopes to hold face to face meetings in mid-September instead of doing them by online video due to travel restrictions if the annual gatherings were to be held as originally scheduled later this week.
The 10-nation bloc hosts the ASEAN Regional Forum, which brings together its top diplomats with counterparts from the United States, China, Japan, Russia, India, the two Koreas and other Asia Pacific countries to discuss the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and other security issues.
Most of about 1,300 ASEAN meetings this year have so far been shifted online due to the coronavirus pandemic, including an annual summit of ASEAN leaders last month. More sensitive talks, including secretive negotiations between China and ASEAN member states for a so-called “code of conduct” in the disputed South China Sea, have been delayed indefinitely, said the two diplomats, who spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to discuss the matter publicly.

WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump won’t be throwing out the first pitch at Yankee Stadium next month after all.
Trump tweeted Sunday that he won’t be able to make the trip because of his “strong focus” on the coronavirus, vaccines and the economy. Trump said in the tweet: “We will make it later in the season!”
He had announced at a briefing Thursday on Major League Baseball’s opening day that he’d be at Yankee Stadium on Aug. 15 to throw out the first pitch.
Trump has been trying to show voters that he is taking the virus seriously by holding briefings and canceling Republican convention events set for Jacksonville, Florida. Florida is among several states where the virus is raging.

ST. PAUL, Minn. — Minnesota health officials reported 871 newly confirmed coronavirus cases on Sunday, the fourth straight day the state has reported more than 700 new cases.
The spike in new daily cases was one of the largest in Minnesota since May, the Star Tribune reported. But the increase came on a volume of more than 16,000 completed tests, which is much higher than daily test tallies in May.
The new cases raise the total of confirmed infections in Minnesota since the pandemic started to more than 51,000.
Three new deaths also were reported Sunday, raising Minnesota’s death toll to 1,574. One of the newly reported deaths was a resident of a long-term care or assisted-living facility. Such residents make up more than three-quarters of the people who have died of COVID-19 in Minnesota.
A total of 273 patients were hospitalized Sunday, down from 287 on Saturday. The number of patients requiring intensive care remained at 115 on Sunday. Daily counts for hospitalized patients in Minnesota have been trending down or holding steady in recent weeks.

ORLANDO, Fla. — Florida surpassed New York over the weekend as the state with the second-most confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S.
More than 9,300 new cases were reported in the Sunshine State on Sunday, along with 78 new deaths.
Florida’s nearly 424,000 coronavirus cases as of Sunday are surpassed only by California, which has more than 450,000. With 39.5 million residents, California has almost double Florida’s population of 21.4 million.
New York, slightly less populous than Florida with 19.4 million residents, has close to 412,000 cases and was once the epicenter of the virus in the U.S. Texas, the only state besides California with more people than Florida, has about 390,000 cases.

VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis led pilgrims gathered in St. Peter’s Square for the weekly Sunday blessing in a round of applause for elderly people suffering from loneliness during the pandemic.
Francis, on the feast day for Jesus’s maternal grandparents Saints Anne and Joachim, urged the faithful to consider every elderly person his or her own grandparent.
‘’Don’t leave them alone,’’ he implored, urging the faithful to reach out with a phone call, video chat or a visit where possible under distancing rules to impede the virus’ spread.
‘’I would like to invite young people to make a gesture of tenderness toward the elderly, especially those who are alone, at home and in residences, those who for many months have not seen loved ones,’’ the pope said.
‘’Send them a hug,’’ the pope said. ‘’They are your roots.’’
The elderly have been especially vulnerable to the new coronavirus, and outbreaks in nursing homes have proven particularly deadly. In many places, the elderly are not permitted visits from loved ones, and are restricted to periodic phone calls and video chats, or at most a wave through a window.

SKOPJE, North Macedonia — Health authorities in North Macedonia reported that confirmed cases of the coronavirus surged above 10,000, meaning that almost 0.5 percent of the population of 2.1 million have been infected.
The number of new cases over the past day was 152, raising the total to 10,086. No fatalities were recorded for the first time in two weeks, but the number of deaths, 460, still puts Macedonia 19th globally (10th in Europe) in deaths per million.

MADRID — Spain says it is negotiating with Britain to exclude the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands from a 14-day quarantine imposed on travelers returning to Britain from Spain.
Foreign Minister Arancha González Laya said Sunday, hours after the British measure took effect, that “our efforts at the moment are focused on ensuring that the British authorities can exclude the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands from their quarantine measures.”
The emergence of clusters of the coronavirus has worried authorities in northeast Catalonia and Aragón but has not appeared in Spain’s two archipelagos, which are highly popular tourist destinations for British and other European visitors.
González Laya says that the islands are “highly controlled territories” and that their current epidemiological situation is not worse than that of Britain.
Tui, Britain’s biggest tour operator, said Sunday it has canceled all flights due to depart to mainland Spain, but it has maintained flights and travel packages for trips to Spain’s Balearic and the Canary Islands.

HONOLULU -- As Hawaii prepares for the onslaught of Hurricane Douglas, state health department officials contacted each of the 625 people who were currently in isolation or quarantine as of Friday because they are either COVID-19 positive or have been in contact with someone who is. Every one of those indicated they would shelter-in-place and not seek refuge at a hurricane shelter.
Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell said that gives officials a sigh of relief.
Hawaii has some of the lowest coronavirus infection rates in the nation, but COVID-19 numbers have been rising in recent weeks. Every day since Thursday, Hawaii has reported record highs of newly confirmed cases, including 73 on Saturday.
Caldwell says 13 shelters were to open at 9 a.m. Sunday around Oahu, well ahead of the hurricane impacting the island, anywhere from midday into the evening. People will have to wear face coverings to be admitted, and will have to wear them unless they are eating, drinking or sleeping.

BELGRADE, Serbia — Serbia has reported a record number of daily cases of the new coronavirus.
Health authorities said Sunday that 467 people have tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours, the highest number since the start of the outbreak. They said eight people have died.
Epidemiologist Darija Kisic Tepavcevic said, however, that there is reason to be optimistic because there have been fewer people in need of hospitalization.
Serbia has confirmed 23,730 cases of the virus while 534 people have died of COVID-19 in the country of some 7 million people.
Numbers of new infections spiked after the Balkan country fully relaxed lockdown measures in May that critics say was a maneuver to pave the way for a parliamentary vote in June. Authorities have denied this, but the government crisis team has faced calls to step down over its handling of the outbreak.
___
BERLIN — A popular resort town in Austria has ordered restaurants and clubs to close early and urged people to avoid going out as it grapples with a new outbreak of the coronavirus.
The dpa news agency reported Sunday that hundreds of people have already been tested in the town of St. Wolfgang, east of Salzburg, after the outbreak was first detected Friday. At least 44 of those have tested positive, at least 26 whom are interns working in the tourism industry, Austria’s Kurier newspaper reported.
They’re thought to have become infected while partying in the town’s bars, two of which have now been temporarily closed to prevent further spread. All have been ordered to close no later than 11 p.m. until further notice, the Kurier reported.
Austria had relaxed many coronavirus restrictions in recent weeks, but has seen a rise in the number of infections lately.
Chancellor Sebastian Kurz last week announced that the country was reintroducing mandatory face masks again in supermarkets, smaller grocery stores, post offices and banks.

ISLAMABAD — A Pakistani health official is warning that the coronavirus curve that flattened last month could spike again in the country if people violate social distancing regulations during the upcoming Eid al-Adha festival.
The three-day festival will be celebrated in Pakistan starting July 31.
The health official, Zafar Mirza, said at a news conference Sunday that more than 80% of coronavirus patients have recovered in Pakistan. But he said the experience of other countries showed that COVID-19 cases could spike again in Pakistan if people don't adhere to social distancing rules.
His comments came hours after Pakistan reported 1,226 new cases. The country has confirmed a total of 273,113 cases, including 5,822 deaths.
___
JOHANNESBURG — South Africa has announced more than 12,000 new confirmed coronavirus cases as the total in one of the world’s worst affected countries reaches 434,200 with 6,655 deaths.
South Africa makes up well over half the confirmed cases on the African continent, where experts say the virus could smoulder in areas poorly served by health services.
Africa now has more than 828,000 cases. The true number of cases on the continent of 1.3 billion people is unknown because of testing shortages and insufficient data.
The World Health Organization has said more than 10,000 health workers in Africa have been infected, many of them nurses, further challenging efforts to contain the virus spread.

WHAT’S UP WITH TRUMP’S ORDERS ON TIKTOK AND WECHAT?
NEW YORK (AP) - President Donald Trump has ordered a sweeping but vague ban on dealings with the Chinese owners of popular apps TikTok and WeChat, saying they are a threat to U.S. national security, foreign policy and the economy. But it’s far from clear what the administration intends to actually do. Uncertainty also surrounds what effect the orders will have on the apps’ users, whether the administration will face legal challenges, and what the companies — or China — will do next. Microsoft is in talks to buy parts of TikTok, in a potential sale that’s being forced under Trump’s threat of a ban.
HUAWEI: SMARTPHONE CHIPS RUNNING OUT UNDER US SANCTIONS
BEIJING (AP) - An executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei says it is running out of processor chips to make smartphones due to U.S. sanctions. The executive says production of Huawei’s own chips will stop next month because its contractors are barred from using U.S. manufacturing technology. Huawei is at the center of growing U.S.-Chinese tension over technology and security. The company, one of the biggest makers of smartphones and nextwork equipment, denies accusations it is a security risk and might facilitate Chinese spying. Washington cut off Huawei’s access to U.S. components and other technology last year. The White House tightened those controls in May by barring vendors worldwide from using U.S. technology to make chips or other components for Huawei.
PRO-RUSSIA VACCINE MISINFO FINDS HOME IN US FACEBOOK GROUPS
CHICAGO (AP) - A false report claiming five Ukrainians had died after taking an American-made vaccine spread in just a matter of days from a small Kremlin-friendly Ukrainian website to an audience of thousands in U.S.-based Facebook groups. The falsehood has spread online, despite the fact that the World Health Organization says a vaccine is not even being tested in Ukraine. This type of misinformation could raise distrust and fear around a successful vaccine, threatening hopes of ending the pandemic, especially as the U.S. readies plans to deliver 300 million doses to Americans starting next year.
CHICAGO SCIENCE MUSEUM GETS GRANT TO DIGITIZE ARTIFACTS
CHICAGO (AP) - The Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago is getting a grant to digitize thousands of its artifacts. Museum officials say the roughly $225,000 grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services will help build an online collections website with free public access to 7,000 artifacts. The digital collections will include high-resolution 360-degree photographs. Kathleen McCarthy is the museum’s director of collections and says the artifacts are a “hidden resource” that’ll become accessible globally. The artifacts cover a wide range of items, from a treadmill for dogs used to power farm equipment to a WWII German U-505 submarine.

BEIJING (AP) — China ordered the United States on Friday to close its consulate in the western city of Chengdu, ratcheting up a diplomatic conflict at a time when relations have sunk to their lowest level in decades.
The move was a response to the Trump administration's order this week for Beijing to close its consulate in Houston after Washington accused Chinese agents of trying to steal medical and other research in Texas.
China appealed to Washington to reverse its “wrong decision,” and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the current difficulties are completely created by the U.S. side.
Chinese-U.S. relations have soured amid a mounting array of conflicts including trade, the handling of the coronavirus pandemic, technology, spying accusations, Hong Kong and allegations of abuses against Chinese Muslims.
“The measure taken by China is a legitimate and necessary response to the unjustified act by the United States,” said a foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin.
“The current situation in Chinese-U.S. relations is not what China desires to see. The United States is responsible for all this,” Wang said. “We once again urge the United States to immediately retract its wrong decision and create necessary conditions for bringing the bilateral relationship back on track.”
Wang said some consulate personnel “interfered in China’s internal affairs and harmed China’s security interests” but gave no details. He said Beijing complained “many times” to Washington about that.
Also Friday, the U.S. State Department sent out a notice warning Americans in China of a “heightened risk of arbitrary detention.”
“U.S. citizens may be subjected to prolonged interrogations and extended detention for reasons related to ‘state security,’” the notice said.
Americans may be detained or deported for “sending private electronic messages critical"" of the Chinese government, it said. The notice gave no indication of what prompted the warning.
On Tuesday, the Trump administration ordered the Houston consulate closed within 72 hours. It alleged Chinese agents tried to steal data from facilities including the Texas A&M medical system.
The ministry on Thursday rejected the allegations as “malicious slander.” It warned the Houston consulate's closure was “breaking down the bridge of friendship” between the two countries.
The United States has an embassy in Beijing and consulates in five other mainland cities — Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Shenyang and Wuhan. It also has a consulate in Hong Kong, a Chinese territory.
The consulate in Chengdu is responsible for monitoring Tibet and other areas in the southwest inhabited by nonethnic Chinese minorities that are considered especially sensitive by Beijing.
Asian stock markets, already uneasy about the uncertain pace of recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, fell Friday on the news of the closure.
China’s market benchmark, the Shanghai Composite Index, lost 3.9%. Hong Kong’s main index declined 2.2%.
“Alongside the eviction of the Houston Chinese Consulate, the risk of the U.S.-China conflict escalating into a ‘Cold War’ is worrying,” Hayaki Narita of Mizuho Bank said in a report.
The consulate in Chengdu was in the news in 2012 when Wang Lijun, the police chief of the major city of Chongqing, visited and told American officials his concerns about the death of a British business associate of the wife of Chongqing's Communist Party secretary, Bo Xilai.
That prompted the British Embassy to ask for a new investigation, which led to the arrest and conviction of Bo's wife. Bo was later dismissed and sentenced to prison.
The consulate was surrounded by police while Wang was inside. He later emerged and was arrested and sentenced to 15 years on charges of corruption and defection. The U.S. government has refused to confirm whether Wang asked for asylum.
In March, American reporters for The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal were expelled from China. That was in response to the Trump administration's decision to limit the number of U.S. visas for Chinese employees of state media.
Operations of nine Chinese state media outlets in the United States have been required to register as “foreign missions” due to their ties with the ruling Communist Party. That doesn't affect their ability to conduct reporting but requires them to report their staff and real estate holdings as they would if they were embassies.
Also Thursday, the U.S. Justice Department said it believes the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco is harboring a Chinese researcher, Tang Juan, who is accused of lying about her background in the Communist Party's military wing on a visa application.
The department announced criminal charges of visa fraud against Tang and three other Chinese researchers. It said Tang lied on a visa application last October as she made plans to work at the University of California, Davis, and again during an FBI interview months later.
U.S. authorities this week announced criminal charges against two Chinese computer hackers who are accused of targeting companies that are working on vaccines for the coronavirus.
U.S. officials including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have stepped up accusations of technology theft. In a speech Thursday, Pompeo said some Chinese students and others “come here to steal our intellectual property and to take this back to their country.”

SALT LAKE CITY — Utah's number of COVID-19 cases has increased by 2,302 on Tuesday, with 12 more deaths reported, according to the Utah Department of Health.
The health department now estimates there are 56,961 active cases of the disease in Utah. The rolling seven-day average number of positive cases per day is now at 2,478, according to the health department. The positive test rate per day for that time period is now 23.7%.
Also Tuesday, Salt Lake County surpassed 100,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases since the beginning of the pandemic — just the 17th county in the nation to cross that threshold, according to Johns Hopkins University.
Tuesday's numbers indicate a 0.9% increase in positive cases statewide since Monday. Of the 1,657,278 people tested for COVID-19 in Utah so far, 15.4% have tested positive for the disease. A total of 8,360 new people were tested for COVID-19 as of Tuesday, and 14,486 more tests were conducted, state data shows.
There are 544 COVID-19 patients currently hospitalized in Utah, state data shows. Of those, 202 are occupying intensive care unit beds across the state. About 89% of all ICU beds in the state are occupied as of Tuesday, with about 91% occupancy in Utah's 16 referral hospitals. About 48% of non-ICU hospital beds are occupied in Utah as of Tuesday.
The health department reported 8,518 COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in Utah as of Tuesday, up from 6,519 on Monday. A total of 25,000 vaccine doses have been shipped to Utah so far, state data shows, though health officials say there is a reporting lag of up to seven days from when doses are shipped to Utah, administered to patients, and then reported to the health department.
The health department will start reporting how many total people have been vaccinated in Utah once people start receiving their second doses of the vaccine.
The 12 deaths reported Tuesday were:
- A Salt Lake County woman who was between the ages of 65 and 84 and was a resident of a long-term care facility
- A Utah County woman who was between the ages of 65 and 84 and was a resident of a long-term care facility
- A Salt Lake County man who was between the ages of 65 and 84 and was a resident of a long-term care facility
- Two Salt Lake County men who were between the ages of 45 and 64 and were hospitalized when they died
- A Washington County woman who was between the ages of 65 and 84 and was not hospitalized when she died
- A Box Elder County man who was between the ages of 65 and 84 and was hospitalized when he died
- A Salt Lake County woman who was between the ages of 45 and 64 and was not hospitalized when she died
- A Utah County woman who was over the age of 85 and was hospitalized when she died
- A Utah County woman who was between the ages of 65 and 84 and was a resident of a long-term care facility
- A Washington County woman who was over the age of 85 and was not hospitalized when she died
- A Uintah County woman who was between the ages of 45 and 64 and was not hospitalized when she died
Tuesday's totals give Utah 255,085 total confirmed cases, with 10,218 total hospitalizations and 1,173 total deaths from the disease since the pandemic began. A total of 196,951 Utah COVID-19 cases are now estimated to be recovered, state data shows.
There is not a COVID-19 news conference scheduled for this week.
Methodology:
Test results now include data from PCR tests and antigen tests. Positive COVID-19 test results are reported to the health department immediately after they are confirmed, but negative test results may not be reported for 24 to 72 hours.
The total number of cases reported by the Utah Department of Health each day includes all cases of COVID-19 since Utah's outbreak began, including those who are currently infected, those who have recovered from the disease, and those who have died.
Recovered cases are defined as anyone who was diagnosed with COVID-19 three or more weeks ago and has not died.
Referral hospitals are the 16 Utah hospitals with the capability to provide the best COVID-19 health care.
Deaths reported by the state typically occurred two to seven days prior to when they are reported, according to the health department. Some deaths may be from even further back, especially if the person is from Utah but has died in another state.
The health department reports both confirmed and probable COVID-19 case deaths per the case definition outlined by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. The death counts are subject to change as case investigations are completed.
For deaths that are reported as COVID-19 deaths, the person would not have died if they did not have COVID-19, according to the health department.
Data included in this story primarily reflects the state of Utah as a whole. For more localized data, visit your local health district's website.

LONDON (Reuters) — One of the world's leading COVID-19 experimental vaccines produces an immune response in both old and young adults, raising hopes of a path out of the gloom and economic destruction wrought by the novel coronavirus.
The vaccine, developed by the University of Oxford, also triggers lower adverse responses among the elderly, British drugmaker AstraZeneca, which is helping manufacture the vaccine, said on Monday.
A vaccine that works is seen as a game-changer in the battle against the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 1.15 million people, shuttered swathes of the global economy and turned normal life upside down for billions of people.
""It is encouraging to see immunogenicity responses were similar between older and younger adults and that reactogenicity was lower in older adults, where the COVID-19 disease severity is higher,"" an AstraZeneca spokesman said.
""The results further build the body of evidence for the safety and immunogenicity of AZD1222,"" the spokesman said, referring to the technical name of the vaccine.
AstraZeneca did not provide detail of the data behind the statement or say when it would publish eagerly awaited late-stage phase III trial data, which would show whether the vaccine works well enough in large-scale trials for it to be approved.
The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is expected to be one of the first from big pharma to secure regulatory approval, along with Pfizer and BioNTech's candidate.
The news that older people get an immune response from the vaccine is positive because the immune system weakens with age and older people are those most at risk of dying from the virus.
If it works, a vaccine would allow the world to return to some measure of normality after the tumult of the pandemic.
British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said a vaccine was not yet ready, but he was preparing logistics for a possible roll out mostly in the first half of 2021.
Asked if some people could receive a vaccine this year he told the BBC: ""I don't rule that out but that is not my central expectation.""
Common cold virus
Work began on the Oxford vaccine in January. Called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the viral vector vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus that causes infections in chimpanzees.
Immunogenicity blood tests carried out on a subset of older participants echo data released in July which showed the vaccine generated ""robust immune responses"" in a group of healthy adults aged between 18 and 55, the Financial Times reported earlier.
""We need to see the data before concluding that the responses were 'similar',"" Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said.
He said that reactogenicity, which refers to common side-effects of vaccines like soreness and redness of the arm, was ""often, but not always"" associated with a vaccine's immunogenicity.
""Studies carried out in the first stage of development of a vaccine will result in choosing a dose that does not cause too much reactogenicity,"" he said.
AstraZeneca has signed several supply and manufacturing deals with companies and governments around the world as it gets closer to reporting early results of a late-stage clinical trial.
It resumed the U.S. trial of the experimental vaccine after approval by U.S. regulators, the company said on Friday.
Staff at a London hospital trust have been told to be ready to receive the first batches of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, The Sun newspaper reported on Monday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) — The dollar struggled on Wednesday, after gaining for three straight sessions, as risk appetite grew on expectation of an imminent post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and the European Union.
Sterling and the euro took off against the greenback after the Brexit headlines, as did currencies tied to higher risk appetite such as the Australian, Canadian and New Zealand dollars.
Reuters reported, citing sources, that EU states have started to prepare their procedure to put in place a new trade deal with the United Kingdom from Jan. 1, indicating a deal could be imminent.
U.S. Treasury yields rose, in line with those in Europe and the UK.
In midmorning trading, the dollar fell 0.3% to 90.16.
The dollar index has weakened more than 6% this year as investors bet the U.S. Federal Reserve will keep its policy ultra-easy. Expectations for further declines by the dollar are helping buoy stock markets and emerging-market currencies.
""We have a lower uncertainty premium compared to March. The addition of the vaccines ... has basically established what we have known since the summer which is a weaker dollar,"" said Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist, at TD Securities in New York.
But he said he would not be surprised if the dollar rallies into the new year simply because of technical and momentum indicators.
U.S. data was mixed on Wednesday, but had little currency impact.
Initial jobless claims unexpectedly fell last week, though remained elevated, and a separate report showed consumer spending fell last month for the first time since April. U.S. new home sales were disappointing as well.
The euro rose 0.4% to $1.2207. The single currency earlier this month hit its highest in more than two-and-a-half years.
Sterling extended gains versus the dollar, rising above $1.35. The pound which had earlier firmed on the lifting of a French border blockage, last traded up 1.1% at $1.3526. Against the euro, the pound jumped 0.9% at 90.23 pence.
The Brexit headlines overshadowed President Donald Trump's threat to veto the U.S. stimulus bill. Trump said the long-awaited stimulus package should be amended to increase the amount in the stimulus checks — potentially disrupting the bill.
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar gained 0.8% against the dollar to US $0.7578 , boosted in part by signs that a small COVID-19 outbreak in Sydney would be contained. The New Zealand dollar also rose 0.7 to US $0.7090.The dollar dropped 0.2% against the Japanese yen, another safe haven, to 103.44.

SALT LAKE CITY — Both Vice President Mike Pence and California Sen. Kamala Harris were able to draw sharp differences between the Republican and Democratic presidential tickets Wednesday night in their only debate before the November election, held at the University of Utah.
But despite frequent interruptions and not many direct answers, the vice presidential candidates stopped short of repeating the chaos of last week’s first — and possibly only — debate between Republican President Donald Trump, who was later diagnosed with COVID-19, and Democratic former Vice President Joe Biden.
The deadly virus was the first topic tackled during the 90-minute debate in Kingsbury Hall before a socially distanced audience limited to some 200 people who had to test negative for COVID-19 and were warned that if they removed their masks, they’d be escorted off the premises by law enforcement.
“Frankly, this administration has forfeited its right to reelection” based on its response to the virus, Harris said, criticizing Trump for not sharing information he had early on about its seriousness. She said she would not take a vaccine recommended by the president but would be “first in line” for one backed by medical experts.
Pence said “from the very first day, President Trump has put the health of Americans first,” and his efforts, including suspending travel from China into the United States, represents “the greatest national mobilization since World War II and I believe it saved hundreds of thousands of American lives.”
The vice president, who heads the administration’s task force on the virus, took a shot at Biden, saying his plan for combating the coronavirus “looks a little bit like plagiarism” even though the Democratic presidential nominee has called for what would amount to a national mask mandate.
Harris countered, “Whatever the vice president is claiming the administration has done, clearly it hasn’t worked when you’re looking at over 210,000 dead bodies in our country, American lives that have been lost.” She referred to their “ineptitude” and said too much has been sacrificed because of “incompetence.”
The rest of the debate — which included questions on the U.S. Supreme Court vacancy the president is pressing to fill quickly and the economy — followed a similar pattern with both candidates at times talking over moderator Susan Page, USA Today’s Washington bureau chief, as she tried to enforce a two-minute rule for answers.
Pence said he was “honored” to attend a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden for Trump’s pick for the high court, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, that has been described as a “super-spreader” event for COVID-19 after Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and a number of other officials there tested positive for the virus.
The vice president said he hoped not to see “an attack on her Christian faith” during the confirmation process for Barrett, a devout Catholic, and referred to Harris’ pointed questioning of another of Trump’s Supreme Court nominees, Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
Harris labeled it “insulting” to suggest that, and said she and Biden are also people of faith. The senator and Pence sparred over her not directly answering when asked if she supported “packing the court” by adding more liberal justices. Instead, Harris said the vacancy shouldn’t be filled in the middle of an election.
On the economy, the candidates went back and forth on whether Biden’s plan to repeal the tax cuts pushed through Congress by Trump that Harris said benefited the rich amounted to a tax increase. Pence insisted it did ,while Harris said only Americans earning at least $400,000 would pay more.
“The debate was far more standard political fare and in that sense was very different from the presidential debate a week ago,” said Chris Karpowitz, co-director of Brigham Young University’s Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy. “For that reason, it was also better for the American political system.”
Karpowitz said while the debate may end up pleasing voters on both sides who have made up their minds, it’s not likely to change the race. “On that score, the pandemic and the recession are the fundamental factors shaping the election and will matter far more than the vice presidential debate.”
Presidential debate expert Aaron Kall, who heads the University of Michigan’s debate program, said what was “a more traditional political debate” may not be all that memorable to voters.
“There was no watershed moment during the debate that is likely to galvanize the media cycle following the race, so the topic will likely quickly return to coronavirus,” Kall said. “Nothing from tonight’s 90-minute debate is a game-changer, but it could help the Trump campaign at the margins after such a bad week of press.”
Utah Democratic Party Chairman Jeff Merchant, who watched the debate from Kingsbury Hall as a guest of Harris, said he was “beyond impressed” with her performance. “She was tactful, she was hard-hitting and she was honest,” he said, “in perhaps the toughest position any woman has ever been in American politics.”
Merchant, too, said the debate probably won’t change the outcome of the election but served as “a stark reminder of what is at stake in this election.”
Utah Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, a co-chairman of Trump’s reelection campaign in Utah, said Pence “knocked it out of the ballpark. He’s a man of impeccable integrity, unquestionable integrity. I think he resonated well. There couldn’t be a bigger difference.”
Adams said when Harris didn’t answer the question about expanding the size of the Supreme Court, “that was a low moment for me and some of my great friends on the other side of the aisle, but I would be embarrassed at a presidential candidate that wouldn’t stand up and say what they’re going to do.”
Even before the debate began, Harris already had won a round by insisting there be plexiglass barriers separating the candidates after the vice president attempted to keep them off of his side of the stage before giving in Tuesday to what’s seen as a safety precaution.
The Pence team’s negotiations over the barriers dominated the final day of pre-debate coverage, keeping attention on the administration’s handling of the pandemic. His communications director, Katie Miller, left Salt Lake City because her husband, Stephen Miller, a senior adviser to Trump, tested positive for the virus Tuesday.
Both candidates arrived in the state early — Harris on Friday and Pence on Monday — and both prepared for the debate rather than holding campaign events, although Harris did tour This Is the Place Heritage Park on Saturday. Pence and Harris did reach out to voters in op-eds written for the Deseret News.
Pence reportedly used former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker as a stand-in for Harris during his mock debate sessions in Utah, while Harris had Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who also sought the Democratic presidential nomination, portray Pence, a former governor of Indiana.
Vice presidential debates usually don’t attract the number of viewers that presidential debates do, but this year is expected to be an exception given the increased attention following the chaos of the first presidential debate and then Trump’s COVID-19 diagnosis.
Also, it is not clear whether the two scheduled presidential debates will go forward, even though Trump has said he’ll be ready for the next one, on Oct. 15, despite possibly still being contagious. Biden, however, has said there shouldn’t be another debate if the president still has coronavirus.

NEW YORK — Drugmakers and research centers around the world are working on COVID-19 vaccines, with large global trials of several of the candidates involving tens of thousands of participants well underway.
As some companies close in on unveiling their initial findings — with Canadian and European regulators already reviewing early data on some vaccines — the following is what we know about the race to deliver vaccines to help end the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed over a million lives.
Who is furthest along?
U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc. with German partner BioNTech SE, U.S. biotech Moderna Inc. and Britain-based AstraZeneca Plc. in conjunction with University of Oxford researchers could provide early analyses of data from their various large trials as early as October or November. Johnson & Johnson is a bit further behind.
What happens in these trials?
The companies are testing their vaccines against a placebo — typically saline solution — in healthy volunteers to see if the rate of COVID-19 infection among those who got the vaccine is significantly lower than in those who received the dummy shot. Neither trial participants nor researchers know who has received the vaccine or placebo until the data is ready for review, or unblinded. The studies rely on subjects becoming naturally infected with COVID-19, so how long it takes to generate results largely depends on how pervasive the virus is where the trials are being conducted. In areas with large outbreaks and community spread, infections will pile up faster.
How will we know if the vaccine works?
The United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and the World Health Organization have all set similar minimum standards for effectiveness. Vaccines must demonstrate at least 50% efficacy — meaning at least twice as many infections among volunteers who got a placebo as among those in the vaccine group. Independent panels oversee the trials to monitor for safety and effectiveness since the data is hidden from companies and researchers. These data safety monitoring boards take a peek at the interim results at predetermined milestones, such as after a certain number of people have become infected. If the vaccine is looking significantly better than the placebo, the companies can apply for emergency use, and the study may be halted or continue to its intended conclusion. A trial can also be halted if the panel determines the vaccine to be unsafe.
Will regulators ensure a vaccine is safe before making it available to the public?
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said it will not approve a vaccine unless it is both effective and safe. Earlier this month, it added more stringent safety guidelines for U.S. vaccines. The FDA wants developers to follow trial subjects for at least two months after they receive their final vaccine dose to check for any side effects that may crop up. The agency will consider an emergency use authorization (EUA) once that data is collected from at least half of the trial's participants. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency will review the vaccines for the UK and the European Medicines Agency will review vaccines for European Union use.
When will regulators decide?
Regulators will review the vaccines after the companies have enough data to submit applications seeking an EUA or formal approval. Moderna's first look at data is more likely to come next month. AstraZeneca could provide a look at late-stage data in November. Pfizer/BioNtech said it may have data as early as October, but that it would wait for safety data it expects in the third week of November to file with U.S. regulators.
Regulators for Europe and Canada are considering data on a rolling basis, as it becomes available. The UK and the United States both expect speedy reviews of initial data for possible emergency use before more traditional lengthy reviews for formal commercial approvals.
Could these be the first approved coronavirus vaccines?
Yes, although China and Russia are on a similar timeline. China launched an emergency use program in July aimed at essential workers and others at high risk of infection that has vaccinated hundreds of thousands of people. At least four vaccines are far along including from China National Biotec Group, CanSino Biologics and Sinovac. Sinovac and CNBG have said to expect early trial data as soon as November. Russia's Gamaleya Institute has begun a 40,000-person late-stage trial and is expected to have early data at the end of October or early November. Russia has also given the vaccine to at least hundreds of ""high-risk"" members of the general population.
Is U.S. authorization up to President Trump?
The FDA must make sure that the benefits of a vaccine outweigh the risks before authorization since they are intended to be given to hundreds of millions of healthy people. However, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has the authority to override the FDA's recommendation. President Donald Trump has complained about the new safety guidelines, which delay any vaccine availability until after the Nov. 3 presidential election at the earliest. The Trump administration can hire and fire HHS officials, opening the possibility of political pressure to approve a vaccine.

The COVID-19 pandemic and recent surge of cases and hospitalizations have brought a different aspect to this year's holiday season. This includes the current State of Emergency announced by Governor Gary Herbert that includes new orders of a statewide mask mandate and limiting gatherings to households only.
Intermountain Healthcare is supportive of the governor's actions to reduce the rate of transmission in the community and prevent further increases in unsustainable of levels of hospitalization. Even though these additional restrictions are challenging, healthcare providers around the state are grateful for the community's support in following the new guidelines.
""Even though these additional restrictions are tough on all of us, healthcare providers around the state are grateful for the community's support in following the new guidelines,"" said Brandon Webb, MD, an infectious disease physician at Intermountain Healthcare.
The safety and health of our families and community should be the main focus as we plan holiday events, gatherings, and meals. We are asking members of our community to do whatever they can to encourage others to follow the guidelines outlined by the governor to keep people safe and ensure that hospitals are not being overwhelmed. Here are recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for having a safe Thanksgiving.
Think smaller for dinner
A low-risk holiday can still include the traditional dinner and all the fixings, but because much our community transmission is from close friends and extended family, the CDC recommends keeping it to members who live in your household.
This is understandably hard for many of us who enjoy large holiday gatherings of friends and family. But just like we've done with so many other events in 2020, it's time to bring some ingenuity to the holidays. Consider preparing holiday meals and have them delivered to family and friends, especially those at higher risk of illness. You can also connect with friends and loved ones by holding a virtual Thanksgiving meal through video.
Avoid the shopping crowds
Black Friday shopping has also become part of the holiday event for some on Thanksgiving or Friday. The CDC has listed crowded stores as a high-risk area for virus transmission. This year, consider Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping from the comfort of your home by looking for deals online.
""Online shopping is an especially good option this year. Many retailers are making online ordering, delivery and curbside pickup easy, which helps cut down on unnecessary crowds but still keeps our economy open"" Dr. Webb said.
Stay vigilant
Although the state of emergency household restrictions were announced for a two-week period, it will be important to continue to be vigilant with mask wearing, handwashing and social distancing even beyond two-weeks so we can maintain sustainable levels of transmission while we wait for vaccines to become available.
The state's caregivers and the community need your support to reduce the transmission of this virus. A healthy economy and a healthy population are not mutually exclusive and we are committed to both.

BOSTON (AP) — Dolly Parton is being celebrated in song — a rewritten version of her own ""Jolene"" — for her contribution to an experimental coronavirus vaccine.
Northeastern University associate English professor Ryan Cordell posted a video on Twitter of himself performing a tweaked version of Parton's signature song, renamed ""Vaccine,"" that has drawn tens of thousands of views.
The lyrics, ""Vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine / I'm begging of you, please go in my arm / Vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine / Please just keep me safe from COVID harm,"" were written by linguist and author Gretchen McCulloch, who posted them online and invited people to record them.
""I love that song. I love Dolly Parton. And I don't know — I was inspired,"" Cordell told The Boston Globe on Tuesday. ""So I went and grabbed my guitar.""
Parton's $1 million gift to Nashville's Vanderbilt University Medical Center helped researchers develop Moderna's experimental coronavirus vaccine, announced this week.
Cordell grew up with Parton's music, thanks to his parents and grandparents, and he called Parton's appearance at the 2019 Newport Folk Festival as one of his ""favorite musical memories.""
I couldn't resist trying it immediately, though I had to sing a bit more quietly than I typically would—for this tune in particular—because my family's all asleep right now. But you can see it scans, good enough for country at least! pic.twitter.com/joQL29e7Uk

""So I was just thrilled to see this news that she had contributed to COVID vaccine research — I thought that was amazing,"" he said.
The positive reaction to his video from doctors, nurses and other medical professionals is particularly gratifying, he said.
""And that's really amazing because those folks are under so much pressure and stress, and especially right now as hospitals are getting overwhelmed,"" Cordell said. ""And so if they watched the video, and it made them happy for a minute, that's all I need.""

SALT LAKE CITY — The coronavirus outbreak's impact on the Utah economy has been varied, with major layoffs in the spring, followed by a slow but relatively steady recovery in the summer in numerous sectors, including construction.
And even with many employers allowing workers to perform their job duties remotely to avoid a COVID-19 spread, the construction industry has maintained a solid pace as building projects continue, particularly in the commercial sector.
""Certainly there are certain sectors of our economy there that are suffering more than others, (like) hospitality, hotels, airlines, restaurants, shopping malls and office can be classified in that to some extent as well,"" said Gary Ellis, president of Jacobsen Construction, a Utah-based firm specializing in commercial construction. ""Office (construction) has definitely slowed down. People are still trying to figure out whether people will come back or not and what does that look like in the future.""
Jacobsen is currently involved with several projects along the Wasatch Front, including Kensington Tower, West Quarter Tower and Liberty Sky Tower in downtown Salt Lake City, the new Primary Children's Hospital in Lehi as well as the renovation and restoration of the historic Salt Lake Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
Ellis said the pandemic will likely bring about some changes in how buildings and workspaces are designed in the near-term future, with fewer high-rise projects and added spacing to avoid crowding among co-workers.
""Whereas before, people were trying to cram everyone into smaller and smaller spaces, you may see actually larger office buildings in some cases,"" Ellis said. ""Where the floor plan is of actually larger size so that they can spread people out a little bit and give people a little bit more room.""
He said that while some organizations may choose to allow employees the flexibility to work remotely more often in the future, there will eventually be a time when people come back to their collective workspaces even if it may look a different than before the pandemic struck.
""People are going to try and get very creative and try and provide workspaces that bring confidence back to their employees (to show) that they can provide a safe space for them to work,"" he said. Once a reliable vaccine is found and individuals can return to the workplace, employers will likely develop a hybrid strategy where employees can work in the office a few days and remotely as well with the aim of reestablishing a strong company culture among the workforce, he said.
Meanwhile, other industry observers also believe that rebuilding culture will be among the top priorities when the pandemic eventually subsides and people attempt to regain a sense of workplace normalcy.
""It's not going to be how it was the previous years, but in the office space I don't believe that you can could maintain a corporate culture and maintain your employees from a Zoom call on a considerable basis because you just lose that sense of of togetherness,"" said Jordan Wall, senior executive vice president with Colliers International, a global commercial real estate firm with offices in Salt Lake City. ""What you create with people, the collaborative nature — you just lose that (working remotely).
He said companies will need to work diligently to reestablish the camaraderie that may have once existed before the outbreak occurred. As for the development of commercial office space over the next 12 months to 36 month, he said it may be quite a while before that sector regains the strength it had prior to the pandemic.
""Office is gonna have a big adjustment, in my opinion, and office is in a wait and see mode to where you're not going to see any speculative development coming forth in the foreseeable future,"" Wall said. ""So any of the large developers that you typically see that would go in on a speculative basis are not going to do so with a few minor exceptions.""
On the other hand, he said building in the industrial sector has stayed strong and continues to be robust even through the worst of the pandemic, due in large part to the development of large fulfillment centers for big online retailers. With so many people avoiding the potential for exposure to COVID-19, the need for giant fulfillment and distribution facilities has remained particularly strong and is expected to stay that way for the foreseeable future, he added.
""We're at the crossroads of the West, you can get those deliveries and we've become that hub,"" Wall said. ""That's why the industrial sector (is so hot), today Amazon has now grown to 6 million square feet in our market and there's a number of other providers just like that are continuing to grow in our market.""
He said with demand for industrial space so high, that sector will continue to grow. However, on the office side, he said the story is quite different.
""Office is going to taper off (next year) with select projects that are going to break ground, but it's not going to be of the robust nature that we saw over the last seven to eight years,"" Wall said.",2020-11-21T00:00:00Z,2020,4,20

TOKYO (AP) — We're at the halfway point. The Tokyo Olympics were postponed eight months ago, and now are to open in eight months: July 23, 2021. Crunch time is coming.
Tokyo organizers and International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach have spoken vaguely about how the games can take place in the midst of a pandemic. Plans and dozens of ""scenarios"" have been drawn up about COVID-19 countermeasures: possible quarantines, vaccines, safe distancing, and making the Athletes Village a safe ""bubble environment.""
These ideas will have to become concrete solutions beginning next month and into early 2021.
Hanging in the balance are 11,000 Olympic athletes and 4,400 Paralympians. The IOC depends on the games since 91% of its revenue is from selling TV rights and sponsorships.
Here are some questions and answers about where the Olympics stand on several fronts.
Q: Bach was in Tokyo this week and said vaccines and rapid testing are on the horizon, which he believes will make it much easier to hold the games. Will athletes be required to take a vaccine to compete?
A: Bach says ""no."" But athletes and any official or fan going to Japan will be under pressure to get vaccinated. Officials are suggesting athletes will face a 14-day quarantine after entering Japan.
IOC vice president John Coates said the IOC and national Olympic committees will be looking for ""role models"" among athletes to encourage vaccination. Bach says healthcare workers are a priority for the vaccine ahead of athletes. IOC officials have also suggested vaguely that the Switzerland-based body will pick up some of the vaccination costs. As is often the case, there has been nothing specific.
Q: Will fans be allowed into venues?
A: We still don't know. Bach says he expects a ""reasonable"" number of fans to be able to attend events. There is still no decision announced on allowing thousands of fans from abroad to attend. There is the health issue. But there is also pressure on the operating budget to allow as many fans as possible. The budget foresees $800 million in revenue from ticket sales — the third largest income item. Japan has been successful holding sports events with some fans, at times at the 70-80% capacity level.
Q: How many athletes have already qualified for the Olympics.
A: Officials say 57% of the slots are full. So many have not yet qualified, and many qualifying events have been scrapped by the pandemic. It's clear athletes in some countries have a better chance to train than others. This could leave an uneven playing field and could also force some slots in the Olympics to be awarded without a traditional qualifying event. This is part of the ""collateral damage"" to the Olympics from the pandemic.
Q: Who is paying for the delay and the rising costs?
A: The IOC, organizers, and local politicians seldom talk about the costs. Japan says it's officially spending $12.6 billion to organize the Olympics. [But a government audit last year ](<More AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports>) said it was twice that. All but $5.6 billion is public money. Over and above this, the delay is reported in Japan to cost $2 billion to $3 billion. No one in authority has offered an official number. The IOC has said it will chip in about $650 million toward the delay but has given few specifics.
A University of Oxford study says these are the most expensive Summer Olympics on record.
Organizers recently announced they found simplification savings of about $280 million — about 2% of the official outlays. Tokyo said the Olympics would cost $7.3 billion when it was awarded the games in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 2013.
Q: What's the COVID-19 situation in Japan?
A: Better than most places, but infection cases are rising. About 2,000 people are reported to have died from COVID-19 in Japan, in a population about 125 million. New cases in Tokyo on Thursday topped 500 for the first time. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga says the country is on ""maximum alert."" This surge is not likely to convince an already skeptical population that the Olympics are a safe and sensible idea.
Q: I have read these are the best prepared Olympics in history. Is this true?
A: Bach has repeatedly said this, and he has lauded organizers for their ability to quickly adapt during the pandemic. Few countries could handle the postponement as well as Japan has.
It's ironic, therefore, that Tokyo has also been the subject of a probe by French investigators relating to alleged bribery during the bidding for the games. Bach was asked this week in Tokyo about reported payments of $8 million made by the Tokyo bid committee to Haruyuki Takahashi.
Takahashi is a former executive of the Japanese marketing company Dentsu Inc., the marketing agent for the Tokyo Games. He is reported to have lobbied IOC members for votes.
""With regard to Mr. Takahashi, we received confirmation that there was no infringement of the IOC rules,"" Bach said this week when asked.
Former Japanese Olympic Committee President Tsunekazu Takeda was forced to resign last year after acknowledging he signed off on a $2 million payment to a Singapore-based consulting company for bid work. He denied any wrongdoing.

NEW YORK (Reuters) — The dollar fell to a one-week low on Tuesday, still weighed down by optimism over a coronavirus vaccine, as the outlook for the currency remained downbeat with the Federal Reserve and U.S. Congress poised to do more to ease COVID-19's economic damage.
The euro, sterling, Swiss franc and yen rose against the dollar, while the Chinese yuan hit its highest against the U.S. currency since June 2018.
Drugmaker Moderna became the second U.S. pharmaceutical company in a week to report positive results from trials of a COVID-19 vaccine, considered necessary to eradicate the pandemic.
Policymakers' response to a record number of coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths in several U.S. states is likely to remain of greater concern.
""We're still seeing a follow-through from that vaccine optimism with yesterday's news on Moderna,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.
""But the key story is still about COVID-19 and the short-term pressures it's going to put not just on the U.S, but abroad and it's going to force Congress or the Federal Reserve to do more. Whether we get a stimulus after (President-elect) Joe Biden takes office or whether the Fed does more, the trajectory for the dollar is pretty clear: it's going to be much lower.""
In mid-morning trading, the dollar index fell to a one-week low against a basket of major currencies, and last stood at 92.357, down 0.2%.
Data showing U.S. retail sales rising less than expected in October had minimal dollar impact. Retail sales rose 0.3% last month, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would gain 0.5% in October.
Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.4% to 104.12, while the euro inched higher by 0.1% to $1.1868.
""Euro/dollar remains well-supported, buoyed by global optimism,"" said Chris Turner, global head of markets at ING in a note to clients.
""Given the challenges Europe faces — in the middle of a second lockdown — the euro certainly won't lead the rally against the dollar, but we think the dollar decline is broad enough to drag euro/dollar back to $1.1920.""
Europe's shared currency, however, fell against a broadly stronger pound, which gained on media reports that Britain could reach a post-Brexit trade agreement with the European Union by early next week.
The euro was last down 0.3% versus sterling at 89.56 pence.
The offshore yuan, meanwhile, hit its highest since June 2018 against the dollar at 6.5457 as positive economic data continued to support the Chinese currency.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine appeared set for regulatory authorization this week after U.S. Food and Drug Administration staff endorsed it as safe and effective in documents released Tuesday.
The coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 300,000 people in the U.S. and the government is counting on the Moderna shot to help fulfill its promise to inoculate 20 million this month.
An FDA decision on whether to issue a so-called emergency use authorization for the Moderna vaccine will be made after a panel of outside advisers meets Thursday. The FDA typically follows the advice of the panel, but is not required to do so.
Moderna's is the second vaccine the FDA has considered, behind one from Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech, which was authorized last week. Hospitals in the U.S. began giving the Pfizer shots on Monday.
The New York Times, citing unnamed sources, reported that the FDA decision on Moderna's vaccine would be on Friday. FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the NYT report.
FDA staff said in documents prepared for that meeting that a two-dose regimen of Moderna's vaccine was highly effective in preventing confirmed cases of COVID-19 and did not raise any specific safety issues in adults over the age of 18.
Moderna released data in documents supporting previous statements that the vaccine may prevent some asymptomatic infections of COVID-19.
It said 38 trial participants in the placebo arm of its trial tested positive for COVID-19 without exhibiting symptoms at the time of their second dose — nearly triple the number in the vaccine arm of the trial.
Both Moderna and Pfizer designed their late-stage trials to show that their vaccines were capable of preventing more significant forms of COVID-19, in the hope that the shots could prevent hospitalizations and deaths.
But preventing asymptomatic infection is also important and could reduce the chances of vaccinated people infecting the unvaccinated, further stemming the spread of the disease.
One shot success?
The FDA said that there appeared to be some protection for trial participants after the first dose of Moderna's vaccine, which is given in two shots, with 28 days between inoculations, but there was not enough information on longer term protection.
It said that vaccine efficacy was 80.2% in participants who only received one dose at the time of the interim analysis, which was based on data collected as of Nov. 7.
But the FDA said it could not draw a conclusion because the numbers of participants and time of observation were limited and there was no single-dose arm in the 30,000 person trial.
Moderna said trial participants, half of whom received a placebo, may request to find out if they had a placebo or the vaccine so that they can get either the vaccine or another vaccine potentially available outside of the trial.

The FDA staff said that serious side effects in the trial of the vaccine represented medical events that occur in the general population at a similar frequency as observed in the study.
The FDA did flag the possibility that the vaccine was contributing to Bell's palsy, a type of facial paralysis also reported by participants in the Pfizer trial.
Moderna reported four cases of Bell's palsy, including three among people who had the vaccine and 1 in the placebo group. The company said that three of the cases had resolved itself.
Although the FDA said that the trial participants with Bell's palsy had predisposing factors, the ""potential contribution of the vaccine to the manifestations of these events of facial palsy cannot be ruled out"".
Pfizer reported six cases of Bell's palsy, including 4 in the vaccine arm, which it said was a rate typical of the general population.
Thirteen people who participated in the trial died, six who received the vaccine and seven who received the placebo.
The death rate during the trial was in line with death rates in the general population for patients of this age, the documents said. There was only one COVID-19 related death, a patient who received the placebo.
Moderna shares, which have risen nearly eight-fold this year up to Monday's close, were up 1.8% before the bell.

SALT LAKE CITY — In his lifetime, President Russell M. Nelson, leader of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, has lived through the Great Depression, a world war, witnessed the rise of terrorism, and seen widespread hunger and poverty.
He's also watched his wife of 59 years die from heart failure and lost two daughters to cancer.
""Despite being well trained to treat the very thing that ended her life, I could not save my own wife,"" he said in an 11-minute video released on Friday morning. He added that ""no parent is prepared to lose a child.""
Instead of losing himself in such tragedies, President Nelson said he tries to express thanks to God for his trials.
""Does gratitude spare us from sorrow, sadness, grief and pain?"" he asked. ""No, but it does soothe our feelings. It provides us with a greater perspective on the very purpose and joy of life.""
The 96-year-old faith leader is now encouraging others to do the same as many suffer from the impact of a worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. In the video, President Nelson called upon all individuals to participate in a social media campaign of gratitude, using the hashtag #GiveThanks.
For the next week leading up to Thanksgiving, everyone is invited to share what they are thankful for on social media and mark posts with the hashtag.
""Working together we can flood social media with a wave of gratitude that reaches the four corners of the Earth,"" he said.
Before leading the global church, President Nelson was a successful cardiovascular thoracic surgeon and often spent hours in an operating room. He knows firsthand the unique challenges faced by those in the health care profession and said he greatly honors the commitment that medical professionals have shown in fighting the virus.
As skilled scientists and researchers work hard to develop and distribute a vaccine against the novel coronavirus, President Nelson noted there is no medication or operation to fix the spiritual problems experienced by many in the world. But, he explained, gratitude can serve as a remedy to the pain.
""As a doctor, I know the value of good therapy,"" he said. While it may seem surprising to some or go against natural intuition, President Nelson said the healing power of gratitude has been validated by scientists and men and women around the world.
President Nelson encouraged individuals to unite in prayers of gratitude, in addition to his plea to flood social media with positive messages. He then offered a prayer ""for the world and everyone in it"" and said he hoped those watching would feel inspired to do the same.
As he bowed his head, he first thanked God for the beauties of the Earth and for life, and then asked for a special blessing of protection and inspiration for those working tirelessly to solve the COVID-19 pandemic. He prayed for help in ending the virus that has plagued so many. He also gave thanks for the leaders of nations and others who strive to uplift and asked for relief from political strife.
""Will thou bless us with a healing spirit that unites us despite our differences,"" he prayed. ""Will thou also help us repent from selfishness, unkindness, pride and prejudice of any kind, so that we can better serve and love one another as brothers and sisters and as thy grateful children.""
President Nelson told viewers he grieves with the billions worldwide whose lives have been upended by the pandemic.
""As a man of science and as a man of faith, the current worldwide pandemic has been of great concern to me,"" he said. Back in March and April, President Nelson called for global fasts in an effort to find relief from the global crisis.
The church has also assisted in multiple COVID-19 relief efforts, participating in more than 750 projects in over 135 countries.
Now, as much of the country faces another surge in COVID-19 cases, the faith leader hopes citizens around the world can come together yet again and share positivity — both on social media and through prayer.",2020-11-20T00:00:00Z,2020,4,20

WASHINGTON (Reuters) — The International Monetary Fund estimates that synchronized investment in infrastructure by Group of 20 major economies could boost global output by nearly 2% by 2025, a senior IMF official said on Tuesday.
Deputy Managing Director Antoinette Sayeh told the Rome Investment Forum the global economy had begun to climb back from the depths of the COVID-19 crisis, but a resurgence in infections was delaying the recovery and setbacks were possible.
She said it was vital to bring the health crisis under control through international investment in vaccines, continue fiscal support to prevent cascading bankruptcies, and boost investment in green and digital infrastructure.
Sayeh said significant progress on development of COVID-19 vaccines was encouraging, but international cooperation was needed to manufacture, purchase and distribute them to all countries, including the poorer ones.
She repeated the IMF's estimate that quick and wide sharing of progress on medical solutions could add almost $9 trillion to global income over the next five years, which would also address a widening income gap between poorer and richer nations.
It was also critical to continue fiscal support, such as cash transfers to households, retention support and augmented unemployment benefits that have or are due to expire, Sayeh said.
At the same time, investment in digital and green infrastructure would lay the foundation for more sustainable and inclusive future growth.
Sayeh said the IMF forecast that global gross domestic product would increase by close to 2% by 2025 if G20 countries with the largest spending power simultaneously raised infrastructure spending by 0.5% of GDP in 2021 and 1% in subsequent years, and other G20 economies spent a third of that.
Overall spending could be a third lower to achieve the same outcome than if countries acted alone, she said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) — The safe-haven dollar sank to a fresh two-and-a-half-year low on Wednesday, pressured once again by expectations of further fiscal stimulus for the United States.
A proposed bipartisan coronavirus pandemic-related economic stimulus package on Tuesday worth $908 billion as well as COVID-19 aid talks between U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi lifted the market's appetite for risk and pushed the dollar to its lowest level since April 2018. That trend continued on Wednesday.
Mnuchin said President Donald Trump would sign a pandemic relief deal proposed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
For months, McConnell has been pushing for a $500 billion approach that Democrats rejected as insufficient. The plan includes $332.7 billion in new loans or grants to small businesses, according to a document provided to Reuters.
The momentum for a weaker dollar should continue, said Vassili Serebriakov, an FX strategist at UBS in New York. ""Any bounces in the dollar are likely to find sellers.""
In mid-morning trading, the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was flat to slightly lower to 91.160, after hitting 91.100, the lowest level since late April 2018 overnight.
Data showing slower U.S. private hiring last month also supported some safe-haven buying of the dollar.
Private payrolls increased by 307,000 jobs in November, the ADP National Employment Report showed on Wednesday, lower than economists' forecasts of a 410,000 rise in new jobs. Data for October, though, was revised up to show 404,000 jobs added instead of the initially reported 365,000.
Britain's approval of a COVID-19 vaccine and the possibility that U.S. unemployment data will help spur a pandemic relief package in Washington are likely to support investors' risk tolerance, driving them away from the dollar, Serebriakov said.
Britain approved Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine on Wednesday, jumping ahead of the rest of the world in the race to begin the most crucial mass inoculation program in history.
The euro, meanwhile, was up 0.2% at $1.2095, after earlier hitting $1.2108, the highest since April 2018. The European Central Bank meets next week, and analysts said the euro could be pressured as investors worry the ECB will act to curb its rapid rise.
Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.2% to 104.47.
The Bank of Japan's deputy governor signaled that the central bank was ready to extend pandemic-response programs, saying it would ""take additional easing steps without hesitation as needed.""
Bitcoin was up 0.6% at $18,850, after hitting a record high of $19,918.01 on Tuesday.
The British pound fell after news headlines saying Britain's post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union ""still hangs in balance.""
The pound last traded down 0.7% against the dollar at $1.3324.
The risk-sensitive Aussie dollar turned slightly higher to $0.7375. It bounced in Asia as data showed Australia's economy rebounded more than expected in the third quarter.

SALT LAKE CITY — Utah is expected to receive about 32,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses each week to close out 2020 following a ""miscommunication"" between the federal government and states receiving vaccine doses, according to a state health department spokesperson.
The state has already listed 25,000 doses shipped, according to a Utah Department of Health update on Tuesday. The new weekly estimate means that Utah will likely fall short of the 154,000 vaccine doses it had originally anticipated by the end of December.
Utah was among states that reported late last week that it didn't receive as many vaccine doses that it had estimated in the first week after the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was approved by federal regulators. U.S. Army Gen. Gustave Perna apologized for the gaffe over the weekend, calling the original estimate of vaccines to be distributed a ""miscommunication,"" the Associated Press reported.
""I am the one who approved forecast sheets. I'm the one who approved allocations,"" Perna said during a telephone briefing with reporters, according to the AP. ""There is no problem with the process. There is no problem with the Pfizer vaccine. There is no problem with the Moderna vaccine.""
It now appears that the distribution snafu altered how many vaccines Utah will receive by the end of the year, even though the Moderna vaccine has arrived in the state.
In a series of tweets Tuesday, health department officials stated that 9,750 doses of the Pfizer vaccine from initial shipments. Of those, 86% were already administered. The department added that nearly one in four University of Utah Hospital staff had been vaccinated already.
About 61% of all vaccines delivered to date were received since Thursday, according to the department. A spokesperson for the health department told KSL.com Tuesday that Utah officials now expect 16,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine and another 16,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine every week. If that estimate holds up, it would indicate fewer than 100,000 doses distributed to Utah by the end of the year.
It remains unclear how the adjusted figures will impact projected timelines for when certain groups, such as long-term care facility residents or teachers, will be given access to the vaccine.
Where the vaccines are going
It's been a week now since Utah health care facilities began vaccinating frontline workers. Not long after that began, the Utah Department of Health began providing statistics about COVID-19 vaccinations within the state.
About 8,518 were already administered within the state, as of Tuesday's COVID-19 update. This data may not seem overly exciting since it only reflects hospital staff at this point, but it does show that the gap between when the first five hospitals in the state received the vaccine to the next 30 health care facilities was much less than originally thought.
The health department, which estimated in November that the gap might be as long as two weeks, reported that some vaccines had been administered in all health districts but San Juan and TriCounty (Daggett, Duchesne and Uintah counties) within the first week that vaccines arrived. The first five hospitals covered just three of the 13 districts.
To no one's surprise, Salt Lake County — the health district with the most health care facility employees — had administered the most vaccines as of Tuesday afternoon. At 4,915 vaccines administered, it accounts for about 58% of all vaccines administered so far, according to the health department.
Understanding the UK's emerging COVID-19 strain
One recent international story is gaining interest among researchers worldwide, including those in Utah.
Health officials in the United Kingdom say one new variant of the novel coronavirus in the country is spreading quicker than the original strain prominent there, indicating a mutation. The strain, known as B.1.1.7, was first documented in September and accounted for about one-fourth of all cases by mid-November, Science Magazine reported. It jumped to 60% in London by the start of last week, which scientists said may mean the mutation is 70% more transmissible than the earlier dominant strain.
As noted by the New York Times, Prime Minister Boris Johnson tightened restrictions in London and many parts of southeast London in an effort to stop the spread of the coronavirus strain. Several European countries also banned travel from the U.K. as a result of the spreading mutation.
It's worth noting that experts pointed out pretty early on in the pandemic that SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, had already mutated in different strains. The bigger questions are if the U.K.'s new strain is more lethal or will disrupt COVID-19 vaccine efforts, especially if it appears in other parts of the globe.
So far, researchers say they don't think that will be the case. In an interview with KSL TV Monday, Dr. Sankar Swaminathan, chief of the division of infectious diseases at University of Utah Health, explained that the changes happened in the spike protein that the virus uses to invade human cells. He said there isn't any evidence that would lead experts to believe that it is deadlier or will thwart vaccination efforts already underway in the U.K.
The vaccine, he pointed out, helps produce antibodies in different parts of a spike protein. So when someone is vaccinated, their immune system makes multiple defenses against the coronavirus's spike protein even if parts of it have mutated.
""While it's possible for the virus to mutate and change its spike protein, it would be very difficult for it to change it so completely that the vaccine wouldn't still elicit useful antibodies,"" Swaminathan said.
Dr. Vineet Menachery, an expert in coronaviruses at the University of Texas Medical Branch, also said that it's unlikely that the new mutation in the U.K. will disrupt the two available COVID-19 vaccines, during an interview with NPR on Monday.
Menachery told the news outlet that it takes years of drastic mutations to form before a virus can slip past a vaccine. It's a potential long-term concern, but almost certainly not a short-term issue that would ruin vaccination efforts now underway.
""Vaccines that have been developed are really generated against — to generate a broad response. And so the vaccine uses our immune system to target multiple parts of the virus,"" he said. ""And so in this case, we may have one or two parts that are different, but we're targeting, with the vaccines, multiple parts. And so it's really difficult for a virus to overcome that in the short amount of time like we're talking about here.""
Swaminathan added that while the mutation could become the new dominant strain, it shouldn't stop public health officials from their focus to get enough vaccines administered to stop the spread of COVID-19.

SALT LAKE CITY — The first Utah veterans living in a long-term care facility received COVID-19 vaccines at the George E. Wahlen Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Salt Lake City Monday.
It was a life-changing opportunity for Dana Hare, 39, who served two tours in Iraq and is now undergoing a substance abuse program as a result of his post-traumatic stress disorder. He's been in the hospital for more than two months.
""I didn't think I was going to be the first person,"" Hare told KSL. ""I want to start meeting with people I know and love. I want to get these masks off and start meeting again.""
Hare said the isolation as a result of COVID-19 has been hard to handle.
""It's been difficult, that's already a symptom of our disease. We need interaction with our families — that's one of the things that keeps us healthy,"" Hare said.
That's the same feeling for veteran Christian Smith, 41, who is also going through a substance abuse program to get his life back in order. He was the second person at the hospital to get vaccinated.

""I feel a little guilty. I'm 41. I think there are people older who need it,"" Smith told KSL. He said the isolation has also been very challenging for him as he tries to recover from his PTSD.
""It really affected my recovery and I immediately started struggling. It really, really hurt my recovery,"" he said.
Administrators at the medical center said Monday was a huge day to get the doors back open for these veterans.
""It's better than Christmas,"" said Ashley Phillips, the chief nurse of primary care at the medical center. ""I want to be able to give all of our veterans that vaccine as soon as possible so they can be reengaged in that society.

SALT LAKE CITY — For the rest of 2020, the Salt Lake City International Airport will be a dichotomy of newly built facilities and the husks of old terminals and empty concourses.
It's the price of tearing down an old airport, while at the same time replacing it with a brand-new one.
The former airport's buildings are stripped and barren. Crews have salvaged the buildings of any valuables, and most of what is left are empty stores and disassembled parts.
The rebuilt airport's first concourse opened its doors on Sept. 15, the beginning step in a $4.1 billion project to construct an entirely new airport.
Demolition of the old airport's structures began almost immediately thereafter, said Mike Williams, program director for the Airport Redevelopment Program.
Currently, the parking garage is being torn down and the old terminals are being prepared for demolition to make room for the buildout of Concourse A as well as the central tunnel that will connect Concourse A to Concourse B, which opened Oct. 27.
""That was the first thing that needed to go because that is in the footprint of the extension of Concourse A,"" Williams said of the parking garage. ""So we opened one-half of Concourse A when we opened on Sept. 15, but now we need to build the other half.""
""So there's a lot of work going on. The contractor is now starting to build up their crews so they can have multiple demolition areas going on at once. By the end of the first quarter of next year, Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 will be demolished.""
The former airport will be completely demolished by the middle of next year, he added.
Initially, airport officials planned to do a phased demolition, allowing for passengers to use both the new facilities and some of the old concourses to keep up with the volume of travelers.
COVID-19 changed those plans and saved the airport millions of dollars.
With fewer people flying due to the pandemic, officials decided to demolish the entire former airport at once, which will save $300 million and two years of time, Williams said.
However, the expedited plans could also mean a crowded airport once the pandemic slows and people resume flying in large numbers.
""It made sense, but it was also a very difficult (decision) because you're trying to plan for the future to make sure you can handle the flight capacity as the recovery happens, 'cause we are going to have less facilities in the near term,"" Williams said.
""(We're) really trying to figure out when the recovery happens. It looks like 2022 will probably be a little bit of a challenging year because we won't have a lot of new facilities yet.""
However, he did say that the airport has the capacity to build out to accommodate more travelers, if necessary.
""Now, at any point in time, once we're through with the pandemic and there is a vaccine and people are flying again, we have set things up so we can build to the future,"" he said. ""So we can add onto Concourse B at any time. We've got those plans ready.""
The construction on the project began in 2014, and the new airport is expected to be finished by December 2024.",2020-11-24T00:00:00Z,2020,4,20

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — At least three people were killed when a tornado tore through a seaside town in North Carolina, one of many wild and deadly impacts from a sprawling blast of winter weather across the United States. Millions of people remained without power Tuesday amid subfreezing temperatures, and authorities warned of treacherous travel conditions in many states.
The massive winter storm that immobilized the Southern Plains was heading to the eastern Great Lakes and New England, where heavy snow and freezing rain was expected Tuesday, the National Weather Service said.
The storm system left behind record-setting cold temperatures with wind-chill warnings extending across the nation's midsection, from Canada into Mexico, and another wave of snow and ice was predicted late Tuesday and Wednesday along a storm front extending deep into the South.
The worst U.S. outages were in Texas, affecting more than 4 million homes and businesses Tuesday. More than 250,000 people lost power across parts of Appalachia, and another quarter-million were still without electricity following an ice storm in northwest Oregon, according to poweroutage.us, which tracks utility outage reports. Another 4 million people lost power in Mexico.
Outside of Texas, rolling two-hour blackouts have begun to ease the extreme demand for heat and electricity. In Oklahoma, more than 130,000 homes and businesses were affected. The Southwest Power Pool, a group of utilities covering 14 states, said the outages were ""a last resort to preserve the reliability of the electric system as a whole.""
The blackouts forced a Texas county to scramble to get more than 8,000 doses of Moderna's coronavirus vaccine into arms. The Harris County Public Health facility lost power after 1 a.m. on Monday and its backup generator also failed, said Rafael Lemaitre, a spokesman for Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo.
Looking for large groups of people in places where they wouldn't have to drive and with appropriate medical personnel on hand, county officials distributed the doses at three hospitals, Rice University and the county jail.
""It feels amazing. I'm very grateful,"" said Harry Golen, a 19-year-old sophomore who waited for nearly four hours with his friends, much of it in the frigid cold, and was among the last people to get the shots, which otherwise wouldn't have reached students until March or April.
Hidalgo, the top elected official in Houston, said she didn't believe any of the vaccines were lost. But the worsening conditions also delayed vaccine deliveries. More than 400,000 additional vaccine doses due in Texas now won't arrive until Wednesday at least, officials said.
The tornado in Brunswick County, N.C., killed 3 people and injured at least 10 as it tore through a golf course community and another rural area just before midnight Monday, destroying dozens of homes. Gov. Roy Cooper said rescue operations were continuing Tuesday.
Authorities in multiple states reported deaths in crashes on icy roads from this weather front, including two people whose vehicle slid off a road and overturned in a waterway in Kentucky on Sunday, state police said.
Deaths in Texas included a woman and a girl died from suspected carbon monoxide poisoning in Houston, at a home without electricity from a car running in an attached garage, police said. Law enforcement also said subfreezing temperatures were likely to blame for the deaths of two men found along Houston-area roadways.
With more frigid days expected, frustration mounted over power outages that weren't expected to be resolved until later Tuesday at the earliest in Texas, where surging demand and the loss of some power stations in the cold overwhelmed the power grid, forcing blackouts typically only seen in 100-degree Fahrenheit (38-degree Celsius) summers.
More than 500 people were hunkering down at one shelter in Houston, but Mayor Sylvester Turner said other warming centers had to be shut down because those locations, too, lost power.
Several cities had record lows: In Minnesota, the Hibbing/Chisholm weather station registered minus 38 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 39 degrees Celsius), while Sioux Falls, South Dakota, dropped to minus 26 Fahrenheit (minus 26 degrees Celsius).
In Kansas, where wind chills dropped to as low as minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 34 degrees Celsius) in some areas, Gov. Laura Kelly declared a state of disaster.
Most government offices and schools were closed for Presidents Day, and authorities pleaded with residents to stay home. Louisiana State Police reported that it had investigated nearly 75 weather-related crashes caused by a mixture of snow, sleet and freezing rain in the past 24 hours.
Air travel was also affected. By midmorning, 3,000 flights had been canceled across the country, more than half of them in Texas. At Dallas/Fort Worth International, the temperature was 4 degrees Fahrenheit (-15 degrees Celsius), colder than Moscow.
More winter weather Tuesday will blast large parts of the South with freezing rain, snow and record cold temperatures, the National Weather Service warned.
Northern Louisiana is in the bullseye for the highest amounts of freezing rain from the incoming system, forecasters said in a Tuesday briefing, and more than a foot (30 centimeters) of snow was possible in Arkansas, according to the federal Weather Prediction Center.
About 100 school systems closed, delayed opening or switched to remote classes on Tuesday in Alabama, where forecasters said conditions might not improve in some places until temperatures rise above freezing Wednesday afternoon.

SALT LAKE CITY — Utah's COVID-19 vaccine distributors are coming very close to meeting Gov. Spencer Cox's requirement that they use all doses available within seven days of when they were delivered.
Cox shared the information in a Thursday news conference as an update to the executive order he issued earlier this month in an effort to prevent doses sitting unused on shelves. Vaccine distributors are required to use all doses within seven days of delivery, or the extra doses will be distributed and the facility may face a reduction in its vaccine allocation, according to the order.
Also Thursday, the Utah Department of Health reported the state's number of COVID-19 cases increased by 2,089, with 30 more deaths reported, tying the December 17 record for most COVID-19 deaths reported in a single day. Three of the deaths occurred before December 31, 2020, but were still being investigated by the Utah medical examiner's office, the health department said.
The rolling seven-day average number of positive cases per day is now at 1,829, according to the health department. The positive test rate per day for that time period is now 19%.

Utah vaccine distribution issues
Hospitals, local health districts, community nursing services and other state vaccine distributors have all used 92% or more of any vaccine doses that are older than seven days, Cox said in a news conference Thursday. Currently, there are about 1,800 unused doses in Utah that are over seven days old, but those will be used this week, the governor added.
Pharmacies working through a partnership with the federal government to deliver vaccines to Utah long-term care facilities are struggling to use those older vaccine doses, though. Those facilities are only using 17% of doses older than seven days, and state leaders estimate there are about 26,000 doses currently unused, Cox said.
""They have too much vaccine,"" the governor said. ""The federal government has given them more vaccine than they need.""
The pharmacies, which are working through the federal government and not the state, say they are ramping up distribution and will have vaccine doses in long-term care facilities in the next week, Cox said. He anticipates a ""significant reduction"" in old vaccine doses not being used.
The state is working to recover the 26,000 old, unused doses from the pharmacies to redistribute them to local health districts and get them in the arms of Utahns 70 and older, Cox said.
""That's a big change and something that will make a huge difference,"" Cox said.
New COVID-19 cases
The health department now estimates there are 52,129 active cases of COVID-19 in Utah.
Thursday's new numbers indicate a 0.6% increase in positive cases since Wednesday. Of the 1,935,579 people tested for COVID-19 in Utah so far, 17.2% have tested positive for COVID-19. The number of total tests conducted increased by 20,429 as of Thursday, and 12,793 of those were tests of people who had not previously been tested for COVID-19.
There are now 529 COVID-19 patients currently hospitalized in Utah, including 209 in intensive care, state data shows. About 91% of all intensive care unit beds in Utah are occupied as of Thursday, including about 94% of ICU beds in the state's 16 referral hospitals. About 53% of Utah's non-ICU hospital beds are occupied, according to state data.
A total of 193,777 vaccine doses have been administered in the state, up from 181,169 Wednesday. A total of 20,190 of those doses are second doses, state data shows.
The 30 deaths reported Thursday were:
- A Beaver County woman who was between the ages of 65 and 84 and was hospitalized when she died
- A Cache County woman who was over the age of 85 and was a resident of a long-term care facility
- A Davis County man who was over the age of 85 and was a resident of a long-term care facility
- Two Davis County women who were between the ages of 65 and 84 and were hospitalized when they died
- A Garfield County woman who was over the age of 85 and was a resident of a long-term care facility
- Two Millard County women who were between the ages of 65 and 84 and were hospitalized when they died
- Two Salt Lake County women who were between the ages of 45 and 64 and were hospitalized when they died
- A Salt Lake County woman who was over the age of 85 and was a resident of a long-term care facility
- A Salt Lake County woman who was between the ages of 65 and 84 and was hospitalized when she died

- A Tooele County man who was between the ages of 25 and 44 and was hospitalized when he died
- A Tooele County woman who was between the ages of 65 and 84 and was a resident of a long-term care facility
- A Utah County woman who was over the age of 85 and was a resident of a long-term care facility
- A Utah County man who was between the ages of 65 and 84 and was hospitalized when he died
- A Utah County man who was over the age of 85 and was hospitalized when he died
- A Utah County woman who was between the ages of 65 and 84 and was hospitalized when she died
- A Utah County woman who was between the ages of 45 and 64 and was hospitalized when she died
- A Washington County woman who was over the age of 85 and was a resident of a long-term care facility
- A Washington County man who was between the ages of 65 and 84 and was hospitalized when he died
- A Washington County woman who was between the ages of 65 and 84 and was hospitalized when she died
- Two Weber County men who were between the ages of 65 and 84 and were hospitalized when they died
- A Weber County man who was over the age of 85 and was hospitalized when he died
Thursday's totals give Utah 330,469 total confirmed cases, with 12,803 total hospitalizations and 1,547 total deaths from the disease. A total of 276,793 Utah COVID-19 cases are now estimated to be recovered, according to the health department.
Local health districts still working out vaccine logistics
While there have been reports in some states of vaccine distributors throwing out vaccine doses, there's no evidence that any doses are being disposed of in Utah, Cox said.
""Every one of our partners knows there is no reason to waste a vaccine,"" he said.
Cox said when he took office, he had to choose between two vaccine distribution problems: either having doses sit on shelves or being unused, or have too much demand for the vaccine, leading to backups for people signing up to receive it.
Cox chose the latter, he said. And while it's not ideal to have more demand for vaccines than there are doses available, that's better than seeing doses sit unused or get thrown out, the governor added.
State leaders continue to work through vaccine distribution issues with local health districts, Cox said. The state has amassed a ""small army of volunteers"" to address those problems, he added.
Salt Lake County needed help with vaccine data entry, so the state assisted with some clerical help — dozens of volunteers helped enter thousands of data items to get Salt Lake County caught up, the governor said. Some rural Utah health districts needed technical support to help their websites and call centers keep up with demand for the vaccines, so the state Department of Technology Services worked with those districts to increase their server capacity.
Utah County needed medical personnel help to administer vaccines in some of their busier distribution centers, Cox added. The Utah National Guard has been assisting in that area, and the state sent three more medics to Utah County on Thursday to provide further help.
Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson and Utah Department of Health Interim Executive Director Rich Saunders have been traveling to all of the state's local health districts to address any problems they may have, Cox said. So far, Henderson and Saunders have visited 10 of the 13 districts, and they will be visiting the remaining areas soon, he said.
Health districts have been told that the state will work with them to take care of any issues they face, the governor added. While there are still some growing pains in Utah's effort to ramp up vaccine distribution, it's showing promising results, Cox said.
""The good news is, though, right now we are seeing record vaccinations every day in every one of our local health departments,"" he said.
Two other vaccine producers are weeks away from receiving federal approval to distribute doses, which should help satisfy the demand for vaccines, Cox added.
2nd vaccine doses not being repurposed
The federal government has sent many second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to Utah, but they remain reserved at this time, Cox said. People who have received a first dose of the vaccine should get a second dose several weeks later.
There has been some discussion on a state and federal level about repurposing those second doses and administering them to people who haven't had a first dose, but there is no plan to do so in Utah right now, Cox said. There isn't enough data that supports making that switch, he said.
However, in some cases, people who have had a first dose don't show up for their appointment to get the second dose, Cox said. In those no-show cases, the second doses that have been reserved will be repurposed as a first dose within a week, the governor said. It doesn't mean that if you miss your appointment, you've lost the chance to get a second dose — you will be able to reschedule your appointment and there will be a second dose for you, he added.
""We don't want those doses to be delayed,"" Cox said. ""We won't have a growing glut of second doses; they will always be repurposed for first doses.""
Methodology:
Test results now include data from PCR tests and antigen tests. Positive COVID-19 test results are reported to the health department immediately after they are confirmed, but negative test results may not be reported for 24 to 72 hours.
The total number of cases reported by the Utah Department of Health each day includes all cases of COVID-19 since Utah's outbreak began, including those who are currently infected, those who have recovered from the disease, and those who have died.
Recovered cases are defined as anyone who was diagnosed with COVID-19 three or more weeks ago and has not died.
Referral hospitals are the 16 Utah hospitals with the capability to provide the best COVID-19 health care.
Deaths reported by the state typically occurred two to seven days prior to when they are reported, according to the health department. Some deaths may be from even further back, especially if the person is from Utah but has died in another state.
The health department reports both confirmed and probable COVID-19 case deaths per the case definition outlined by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. The death counts are subject to change as case investigations are completed.
For deaths that are reported as COVID-19 deaths, the person would not have died if they did not have COVID-19, according to the health department.
Data included in this story primarily reflects the state of Utah as a whole. For more localized data, visit your local health district's website.

SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) — Cheering fans instead of cardboard cutouts at Dodger Stadium. Screaming thrill-seekers riding the Giant Dipper roller coaster at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk. Beer lovers bellying up to, well, a table outside a brewery.
Even with some limitations that exclude drinking at a bar, a lot of activities Californians haven't been able to enjoy for most of the past year are suddenly within reach as the state reopens more widely.
April is bringing a fresh breath of warm spring air after a stale year of coronavirus closures. It also may be unleashing a strain of spring fever that was dormant after Gov. Gavin Newsom imposed the first statewide lockdown last March.
""After about a year of being hidden inside, nobody knows how to behave when they go out in public,"" cartoon portrait artist Walt Davis said Wednesday while waiting for customers near the Santa Monica Pier. ""It's been nuts. People come out in public just go crazy right now.""
April arrives with COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths dropping and new infections remaining low. Vaccines open more widely Thursday — to people 50 and over — although supplies remain limited.
But health officials are still urging caution to avoid a fourth wave of the pandemic sweeping across much of the U.S. and other parts of the world.
Dr. George Rutherford, an epidemiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, said the state was in better shape than others because 12 million people have received at least one dose of vaccine and there's a fair bit of immunity — with an estimated 37% of people in Los Angeles County having been infected.
""California has a shot. I think we have a good chance of beating the fourth wave,"" Rutherford said. ""We're much more conservative in (easing) restrictions. So we're moving very slowly through the tiers unlike other states that have thrown caution to the wind.""
Nearly half of California's 40 million people live in areas where restrictions are easing to some degree and some of the largest counties are preparing to allow more people to watch a movie at the cinema, attend church services or dine in a restaurant.
Los Angeles County, with a quarter of the state's population and 40% of the deaths, was approved Tuesday to move into the the orange tier — the second-to-lowest — but opted to wait another week to make sure it holds the line on new infections.
Neighboring Orange County, the state's third most populous with 3 million residents, moved immediately into that tier, allowing restaurants, theaters, museums and houses of worship to allow people indoors at 50% capacity. Bars that don't serve food can operate outdoors.
As Orange County officials announced a new vaccination site at the county fairgrounds Wednesday, they also cautioned against ditching face masks or mingling too closely with people outside the household.
""Every day that we can postpone any additional bad news coming, that's another day we have to vaccinate more people,"" said Supervisor Doug Chaffee. ""That's really the best defense we have.""
The arrival of April comes with much of the state basking in summery temperatures during a week that is spring break for a lot of students who have been cooped up and learning from home. Those two factors and the broader reopening that includes a recent return to indoor dining drove a mini tourist boom Wednesday at the beaches in Southern California.
In Huntington Beach, aka ""Surf City USA,"" which hosted protests against coronavirus closures and mask mandates, people strolled through downtown wearing bathing suits and shorts and — occasionally — face masks. They toted towels and beach chairs as temperatures rose into the 80s.
Colorful umbrellas dotted the beach in Santa Monica and hundreds of people stood in the cool waters near the pier as head-high waves rolled ashore. Tourists from far and near flocked to the scenic pier that was closed throughout much of the pandemic, lining up outside restaurants that are still at limited capacity.
Morgan Reliford said business has been robust at Blazing Saddles, where she had rented out more than 120 bikes by 2 p.m.
Reliford, who wore a mask and purple rubber gloves, said she felt things were reopening too quickly for her comfort.
""I feel like we're bored and frustrated with being in the house that we're kind of rushing it,"" she said.
Thursday marks the opening of day of Major League Baseball with games in Oakland, Anaheim and San Diego before fans for the first time in California since 2019.
The San Diego Padres will be limited to 20% seating capacity, because the second-largest county is in the red tier. If LA moves to the orange tier next week, the World Series-defending Dodgers will be able to hold their home opener April 9 with a third of the stadium full.
The arrival of April also is the first day theme parks will be able to operate, though they'll be limited to 15% capacity and masks will be required.
In addition to the park at the Santa Cruz Boardwalk, Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia and Legoland in Carlsbad are reopening.
Junior Simental, a state prison guard who was waiting with his family to be called for a table at a restaurant on the Santa Monica Pier, said his family can't wait to hit the amusement parks
""We're going to do all of 'em: Six Flags, Disneyland, Universal (Studios),"" Simental said. ""As soon as we get the chance.""

SALT LAKE CITY — Utah's number of COVID-19 cases increased by 1,216 on Friday, with 17 more deaths reported, according to the Utah Department of Health.
Twelve of the deaths reported Friday occurred before Jan. 15 but were still being investigated by the Utah state medical examiner's office, the health department said.
The state now estimates there are 32,727 active cases of the disease in Utah. The rolling seven-day average number of positive cases per day is now at 1,222, according to the health department. The positive test rate per day for that time period is now 16.3%.
There are 349 COVID-19 patients currently hospitalized in Utah, including 117 in intensive care, state data shows. About 77% of intensive care unit beds in Utah are filled Friday, including about 80% of ICU beds in the state's 16 referral hospitals. About 60% of non-ICU hospital beds are filled, according to state data.
A total of 382,881 vaccines have been administered in the state, up from 362,701 Thursday. Of those, 89,948 are second doses of the vaccine.
The new numbers indicate a 0.3% increase in positive cases since Thursday. Of the 2,061,926 people tested for COVID-19 in Utah so far, 17.1% have tested positive for the disease. The total number of tests conducted increased by 14,075 as of Friday, and 7,696 of those were tests of people who had not previously been tested for COVID-19.
The deaths reported Friday were:
- A Davis County woman who was over the age of 85 and was not hospitalized when she died
- Two Salt Lake County women who were over the age of 85 and were residents of long-term care facilities

WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. could soon be giving at least a million COVID-19 vaccinations a day despite the sluggish start, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Tuesday, even as he warned of a dangerous next few weeks as the coronavirus surges.
The slow pace is frustrating health officials and a desperate public alike, with only about a third of the first supplies shipped to states used as of Tuesday morning, just over three weeks into the vaccination campaign.
""Any time you start a big program, there's always glitches. I think the glitches have been worked out,"" the nation's top infectious disease expert told The Associated Press.
Vaccinations have already begun speeding up, reaching roughly half a million injections a day, he pointed out.
Now, with the holidays over, ""once you get rolling and get some momentum, I think we can achieve 1 million a day or even more,"" Fauci said. He called President-elect Joe Biden's goal of 100 million vaccinations in his first 100 days ""a very realistic, important, achievable goal.""
It's an optimistic prediction considering the logistical hurdles facing states and counties as they struggle to administer rationed vaccine supplies amid rising COVID-19 hospitalizations. Fauci pointed to California's swamped hospitals and exhausted workers even before holiday travel and family gatherings added fuel to the outbreak.
Fauci estimated that between 70% and 85% of the U.S. population will need to be vaccinated to achieve ""herd immunity,"" meaning enough people are protected that it's difficult for the virus to continue spreading. That translates to as many as 280 million people.
He said he is hoping to achieve that by the start of next fall.
The coronavirus has killed more than 356,000 Americans, and the next few weeks could bring another jump in infections nationally that ""could make matters even worse,"" Fauci said.
The Trump administration had promised to provide states enough vaccine for 20 million people in December, and fell short even as states struggled with their role — getting shots into people's arms, starting mostly with health care workers and nursing home residents.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, roughly 4.8 million doses of more than 17 million delivered had been used by Tuesday morning. That is probably an undercount because of delays in reporting, but it is far fewer than experts had hoped.
Still, Fauci pointed to a celebrated moment in history to back up his projection of ramped-up inoculations: In 1947, New York City vaccinated more than 6 million people against a smallpox outbreak in less than a month — and ""one of them was me as a 6-year-old boy.""
Related:
If a single city could do such mass vaccinations in weeks, ""this is not something that is far-fetched"" for an entire country, he said. ""You can use school auditoriums, you can use stadiums. You can really ramp up the contribution of pharmacies.""
At that stepped-up pace, the country could see an impact on infections as early as spring — and hopefully by early fall, ""you could start thinking about returning to some degree of normality,"" Fauci said.
Amid mounting frustration over the slow vaccine rollout, governors and other politicians are talking tough and in some cases proposing to bend the rules to get people vaccinated more quickly. Health care workers and nursing home patients are still getting priority in most places.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo threatened to fine hospitals that don't use their vaccine allotments fast enough, saying: ""Move it quickly. We're serious.""
Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina said hospitals and health workers have until Jan. 15 to get a shot or they will have to ""move to the back of the line."" As of Monday, the state had given out less than half its initial allotment of the Pfizer vaccine to about 43,000 people.
In North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper called in the National Guard to help speed things up.
In California, where just 1% of the population has been vaccinated, Gov. Gavin Newsom said he wants to give providers the flexibility to dispense shots to people not on the priority list if doses are in danger of going to waste.
New York's mayor suggested vaccine eligibility be widened to get things moving.
There's no sign yet that a more contagious variant of the coronavirus first found in Britain — which forced England into another national lockdown on Tuesday — will outwit the vaccines. Fauci's colleagues at the National Institutes of Health are doing their own testing to be sure, just as vaccine manufacturers are.
While the variant has been found in several states ""it is certainly not dominant,"" Fauci said. ""We don't know where it's going. We're going to follow it very carefully.""
The more contagious virus makes it even more important that people follow the public health precautions Fauci has preached for months, including wearing a mask, keeping your distance and avoiding crowds.
In addition, scientists are warily watching a different variant found in South Africa but not yet reported in the U.S. There have been reports that the mutation might make treatments called monoclonal antibodies less likely to work. Fauci said he couldn't confirm that, but U.S. scientists will investigate.

FOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) — As soon as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers won the NFC title game, Brian Pope went shopping for a Tom Brady jersey to wear when he watches them play in the Super Bowl.
One problem: Pope lives in Connecticut. And he isn't really even a Buccaneers fan — or at least he wasn't, until Brady left the New England Patriots to make another championship run with Tampa Bay.
""I'll be watching, and I'll be rooting for Brady,"" Pope said as he eyed a rack of the quarterback's Patriots and Michigan Wolverines jerseys in the Gillette Stadium pro shop on Monday afternoon.
""I wish he hadn't left, but so be it,"" Pope said. ""I'm still a Patriots fan, but I'm not upset that he's playing in the Super Bowl, by any stretch.""
Brady won an NFL record six Super Bowls with the Patriots, and he also played in three others during a 20-year career in New England that ended when he signed with the Buccaneers as a free agent in March.
Since then, the fans he left behind have been following him from afar. And now that he is getting ready to play in his 10th Super Bowl, many are rooting for him as if he'd never left.
""He was here 20 years; he did a great job; never got into trouble. So why not pursue his dream,"" said Kathie McCarthy, who was at Gillette Stadium to receive her COVID-19 vaccination.
""I wish there was some way we could have kept him,"" she said, checking her watch to make sure she wasn't late for her appointment. ""But people forget these are their jobs. These are their lives.""
Boston has a long history of watching its star athletes leave, dating back at least as far as the Red Sox's sale of Babe Ruth to the rival Yankees in 1919. Ruth went on to win four World Series in New York; the Yankees won 26 before the Red Sox won it all again, snapping an 86-year drought in 2004.
Bruins star Bobby Orr finished his career with the Chicago Blackhawks, and fellow Hall of Fame defenseman Ray Bourque was traded to the Colorado Avalanche for the chance at a Stanley Cup that the Bruins were unable to give him.
And just last summer, 2018 AL MVP Mookie Betts was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers, following a trail out of town previously blazed by Red Sox stars like Ruth, Carlton Fisk and Roger Clemens. The Dodgers went on to win the World Series.
""This might be worse than Mookie because (Brady) has been there so long and won so many championships,"" Pope said. ""I obviously wasn't here when Babe Ruth left, but I'd say it's got to equal that.""
Pope said he went online after the Buccaneers' 31-26 victory over the Green Bay Packers on Sunday night and ordered Brady's No. 12 Tampa Bay jersey in pewter. But he received a delivery date of Feb. 11 — four days after the Super Bowl.
So he drove up from Connecticut to see if the Patriots Pro Shop had any Brady Buccaneers gear in stock.
No such luck.
Instead, Brady jerseys from his time in New England and Michigan shared a rack with other former Patriots players, including tight end Rob Gronkowski, who joined his longtime quarterback in Tampa Bay. Some Brady merchandise was discounted, but the replica jersey was still full price.
""I hate seeing someone who has played that many years in one place to not retire there,"" Pope said. ""I don't know whose fault it was. But either way, I'm just a Brady fan.""
Thanks to Brady, January has been a busy time in Foxborough, with the Patriots hosting at least one home postseason game in 17 of his 19 seasons as the starting quarterback.
This year, things have been quiet, with just a handful of people milling around the Pro Shop on a sub-freezing day and just a few more at the attached mall. The action was on the other side of the stadium, where hundreds lined up to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in one of the large function rooms the state has set up as a mass vaccination site.
Kelly Roccabello brought her son to lunch near the stadium on Monday and then over to peek at the field, which has been idle since the Patriots' season ended on Jan. 3. ""He was asking about it the whole time,"" she said.
After popping over to their car so Giovanni could wear his Patriots hat for the interview, Roccabello said she allowed him to stay up late to watch the team win the Super Bowl two years ago. At 6 years old, he had never known a Patriots season without Brady as the quarterback, or without a trip to the playoffs.
Until this year.
So they'll be rooting for the Buccaneers on Feb. 7.
""I think we're just sad about it,"" Kelly Roccabello said. ""But no hard feelings.""

WASHINGTON (AP) — Former President Donald Trump again urged people to be vaccinated against the novel coronavirus, saying he would recommend vaccination to ""a lot of people that don't want to get it, and a lot of those people voted for me.""
In an interview Tuesday night on Fox News, Trump acknowledged that people were free to decide for themselves whether they would be vaccinated against COVID-19.
""We have our freedoms and we have to live by that and I agree with that also. But it is a great vaccine. It is a safe vaccine and it is something that works,"" he said.
Republican opposition to receiving the vaccine is strong. A new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 42% of Republicans say they probably or definitely will not get the shot, compared with 17% of Democrats — a 25-point split.
Trump has promoted vaccination before. When he appeared Feb. 28 at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, he said, ""Everybody, go get your shot.""

SALT LAKE CITY — A year to the day since the fateful Utah Jazz game that would elevate the seriousness of the newly declared COVID-19 pandemic, Utah passed the grim benchmark of 2,000 total COVID-19 deaths since the pandemic began.
But state leaders remained optimistic Thursday as record numbers of Utahns continue to be vaccinated against the disease.
""We feel incredibly optimistic about where we are,"" Gov. Spencer Cox said at a Thursday news conference.
Utah's number of COVID-19 cases increased by 646 on Thursday, with 23 more deaths and 34,290 vaccinations reported, according to the Utah Department of Health.
Fifteen of the deaths occurred before Feb. 11 but were still being investigated by state medical examiners, the health department reported. Thursday's death total puts Utah at 2,015 total deaths reported since the pandemic began.
Cox pointed out that 2,000 COVID-19 deaths has been considered a ""best-case scenario"" for Utah based on several projections for the disease's effect on the state. But he didn't minimize the fact that 2,000 people lost their lives.
""It's still incredibly tragic,"" the governor said.
About 150,000 more Utahns were vaccinated over the past week, which was a significant increase in vaccinations over the week before, Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson said Thursday. Over 34,000 Utahns were vaccinated Wednesday, which is a record vaccination day for Utah, she added.
About 79% of Utahns aged 70 and older have now received at least one vaccine dose, which outpaces the national average for that age group, according to Cox and Henderson. About 64% of the 65-69 age group in Utah has now received at least one dose, while about 29% of the 50-64 age group now has one dose after eligibility was expanded to that group last week.
Though Utah reached the tragic deaths milestone Thursday, state leaders anticipate passing a much more optimistic benchmark in the coming days: Utah will soon administer its 1 millionth dose of the vaccine, Henderson said.
""We're really excited about that,"" she said. ""Our workers are doing such a good job.""
Cox didn't expand eligibility to any new groups Thursday. The governor's office announced earlier this week that eligibility will be expanded to every Utah adult who wants a vaccine by April 1, a target date Cox reiterated Thursday.
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox provided a COVID-19 pandemic update at a news conference Thursday morning. Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson and Utah Department of Health state epidemiologist Dr. Angela Dunn also spoke at the event. Watch the replay of the news conference below.
Vaccine eligibility expanding April 1 to all Utah adults
It's no April Fool — Utah leaders plan on opening vaccine eligibility to all adults who want it on April 1, Cox said.
However, he clarified that that means anyone in the state will be able to start making appointments on that date. Utah still isn't being allocated enough doses of the vaccine to inoculate residents at the rate vaccine clinics are capable of handling, the governor added.
Utah is administering about 150,000 vaccine doses per week, but has the capacity to vaccinate about 300,000 each week, Cox said. If the federal government doubled Utah's allocation tomorrow, the state would be able to handle that influx, he added.
But federal officials are using data that is a few years old to determine vaccine allocations for individual states, Cox said. And since Utah is one of the fastest-growing states in the nation, that data is outdated and Utah is being disproportionately affected and receiving fewer doses than it should, he added.
""It's very frustrating,"" Cox said. ""We've just got to get more doses.""
The rollout for the newly approved Johnson & Johnson vaccine is also going more slowly than state and federal officials anticipated, Cox said.
On the first of the month, when eligibility opens to everyone, Utah still won't have enough doses to vaccinate everyone. Federal officials are planning to use updated data for calculating allocations soon, and Utah state leaders are expecting a major increase in the state's allocation later in April, the governor added.
In the meantime, Utah's statewide mask mandate will expire on April 10, due to House Bill 294, which passed through both bodies of the Utah State Legislature with a veto-proof majority.
Cox said the executive branch would have preferred to get more people vaccinated before lifting the mask mandate, but the legislature disagreed. He asked for the legislature to give as many days as possible before lifting the mandate, and that fell on April 10.
""I obviously don't love the bill,"" Cox said.
Masks will still be required in K-12 schools and at gatherings of 50 or more people, the governor said. Individual businesses also have the right to require masks in their establishments if they want, he said.
The governor pleaded with people to accept their individual responsibility after the mask mandate expires, like his predecessor Gary Herbert asked dozens of times before him.
""Please act with respect toward your fellow human beings,"" Cox said. ""Don't make a fool of yourself because you don't want to wear a mask.""
People should simply shop somewhere else if they don't want to wear a mask inside a business where they're required, Cox said.
Likewise, people shouldn't yell at servers in restaurants if their tables are too close to another group's, Cox said. In moderate transmission-level counties, restaurants are allowed to open at full capacity, so long as patrons wear masks while they're not eating or drinking, and six feet of social distancing is allowed between separate groups in waiting areas.
If people aren't comfortable with those parameters, they should get takeout instead of taking out their frustrations on restaurant workers, Cox said.
""We have to treat each other with respect… this is not a free for all,"" he said. ""We need a measure of grace and patience with each other.""
New COVID-19 cases
The health department now estimates there are 12,935 active cases of COVID-19 in Utah.
The rolling seven-day average number of positive cases per day is now at 524, according to the health department. The positive test rate per day for that time period reported with the ""people over people"" method is now 8.4%. The positive test rate per day seven-day average calculated with the ""test over test"" method is now 4%.
While new cases have trended downward for the first few months of the new year, Utah appears to have reached another plateau in cases over the last week, health department state epidemiologist Dr. Angela Dunn said Thursday.
""It has been a very long and roller coaster of a year,"" she said.
Though cases are plateauing, percent positivity rates, hospitalizations and deaths have all continued decreasing, Dunn said.
But while averages 500-600 cases a day are much better than Utah saw during the winter COVID-19 surge, those case rates still aren't sustainable from a public health standpoint, Dunn said. She urged people to continue wearing masks and adhering to public health recommendations, even as vaccinations are increasing, so those continue to go down.
""We're on our way to the end, we are so close,"" Dunn said.
There are 167 COVID-19 patients currently hospitalized in Utah, including 66 in intensive care, state data shows. About 70% of intensive care unit beds in Utah hospitals are now occupied, including about 71% of ICU beds in the state's 16 referral hospitals. About 56% of non-ICU hospital beds are now occupied, according to the health department.
The new numbers indicate a 0.2% increase in positive cases since Wednesday. Of the 2,273,483 people tested for COVID-19 in Utah so far, 16.6% have tested positive for the disease. The total number of tests conducted in Utah since the pandemic began is now 3,971,360, up 18,923 since Wednesday, according to state data. Of those, 8,139 were tests of people who had not previously been tested for COVID-19.
A total of 936,681 vaccines have been administered in the state, up from 902,391 Wednesday. A total of 618,337 Utahns have now received at least one vaccine dose, and 339,743 have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. A total of 1,151,265 vaccine doses have now been delivered to Utah.
The 23 deaths reported Thursday include:
- A Box Elder County woman who was over the age of 85 and was not hospitalized when she died
- A Cache County woman who was over the age of 85 and was a resident of a long-term care facility
- A Davis County man who was between the ages of 45 and 64 and was hospitalized when he died

- A Washington County woman who was between the ages of 65 and 84 and was hospitalized when she died
- A Weber County woman who was over the age of 85 and was a resident of a long-term care facility
Thursday totals give Utah 376,973 total confirmed cases, with 15,014 total hospitalizations and 2,015 total deaths from the disease. A total of 362,023 Utah COVID-19 cases are now considered recovered, according to state data.
The state's COVID-19 dashboard now includes data on the variants of the disease that are present in Utah. As of Thursday, there have been 33 cases of the B.1.1.7 variant, which was first discovered in the United Kingdom, detected in Utah.
No cases of the Brazilian or South African COVID-19 variants have been detected in Utah so far, according to state data.
Also Thursday, Utah County moved from the high transmission level to the moderate level for the first time since the state began using the transmission index system. Tooele, Iron and Sevier counties have also moved into the moderate transmission level this week.
Beaver, Carbon, Emery, Garfield, Kane, Summit and Uintah counties are still rated at the high transmission level, while Daggett, Piute, Rich and Wayne counties are rated at the low transmission level. All other counties in the state are now rated at the moderate transmission level.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California Gov. Gavin Newsom and state legislative leaders have reached an agreement aimed at getting most public schoolchildren back in classrooms by the end of March.
Under the deal announced Monday, school districts could get up to $6.6 billion if they reopen classrooms by March 31.
To get the money, schools must return to in-person instruction at least through second grade.
However, districts in counties with coronavirus case numbers low enough within a specific classification level must return to in-person instruction for all elementary school grades, plus one grade each in middle and high school.
The proposal does not require staff and students to be vaccinated. Districts are not required to have agreements with teachers' unions.

AMERICAN FORK — Hundreds of teachers and staff members in Utah County's Alpine School District showed up to begin getting the COVID-19 vaccine.
People usually don't like waiting in long lines, however, the line stretching outside Polaris West High School in American Fork Saturday morning was full of people who didn't seem to mind.
""I'm really happy with the amount of people who have come here. I didn't really know what to expect, but I was happy to see a line,"" said Kristy McEwan, a teacher's aide at Sego Lily Elementary School in Lehi.
The line was for teachers and staff with the Alpine School District to get their first shot of the COVID-19 vaccine.
""It's been tough on everybody, and if I can do my part to help others, I'm all for it,"" said McEwan.
The high school was one of three separate locations the Alpine School District was offering vaccines to its staff members.
I think it does bring peace of mind that we're in working with people every day and a little bit safer.
–Michelle Brockbank, Rocky Mountain Elementary.
The district teamed up with Community Nursing Services to give about 3,800 shots to any teachers or staff members who wanted it.
For those who work in the schools, they said even though they'll still have to take precautions, it'll be nice to not be so worried anymore.
""I think it does bring peace of mind that we're in working with people every day and a little bit safer,"" said Michelle Brockbank, who works in the main office at Rocky Mountain Elementary.
Teachers and staff members from @alpineschools started getting their #covid vaccinations this morning. Those we spoke with say it's a step closer to getting back to normal. We're doing a story on this for @KSL5TV at 4:30 and 10pm. #ksltvpic.twitter.com/GtaZGhv8Wc
— Alex Cabrero (@KSL_AlexCabrero) January 16, 2021
There weren't enough doses for everyone in the district, however, administrators said more should be coming soon.
That also means classrooms might be able to get back to normal soon.
Right now, schools in the Alpine District are open for in-class learning, but many students have opted to take virtual classes online because of coronavirus concerns.
For some staff members, they said getting the shot means another step closer to getting back to how things were before March 2020.
""I'm happy to see teachers being able to feel safer in their environment and be able to protect others in our community,"" said McEwan.
Jamie Smith, a nurse who was giving the shots, said she loves seeing the smiles on people's faces once they get it.
""Yes, they're very excited about it,"" she said. ""They look at it as a step forward for us.",2021-01-16T00:00:00Z,2021,1,21

UTAH COUNTY — Despite the number of unfilled appointment slots Monday, the Utah County Health Department said no doses of the COVID-19 vaccine went to waste.
Officials said that 200 appointment slots weren't filled on Monday. Tuesday, the county said it's now focusing on reaching out to those aged 70 and older, which is the group currently eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.
Health department spokeswoman Aislynn Tollman Hill says that, since Friday, they've tried to vaccinate 2,000 people at their Spanish Fork vaccine site. On Monday about 200 slots went unfilled.
""That vaccine will certainly not go unused,"" Tollman Hill told KSL NewsRadio. ""That vaccine will essentially be reallocated throughout this week.""
Tollman-Hill says they're starting to experience less of the crushing demand for vaccines from the 70 and older group and thinks many didn't know they could sign up.
We are getting swamped with calls & messages from those not eligible for the vaccine wanting an appt. Although they mean well, it takes away from our efforts to help those 70+. To receive notifications in our efforts, text ""UCHEALTH"" to 888777 or monitor our website/social media pic.twitter.com/shUkEDzLLb

""We haven't really had to do anything up to this point with, like, advertising to people, 'Hey, this is where you get your vaccine.' We've just said, 'Hey, it's available, come sign up and get it.'""
Tollman-Hill also says they're getting swamped with calls from people who are not eligible yet, wanting to sign up.
Utah County health officials are also pushing others to reach out to their 70-plus neighbors and loved ones. Officials say the easiest way to get notified of new appointments is to text UCHEALTH to 888777.",2021-02-10T00:00:00Z,2021,1,21

SALT LAKE CITY — Utah's number of COVID-19 cases increased by 2,009 on Wednesday, with seven more deaths reported, according to the Utah Department of Health.
The health department now estimates there are 46,034 active cases of the disease in Utah. The rolling seven-day average number of positive cases per day is now at 1,758, according to the health department. The positive test rate per day for that time period is now 18.4%.
There are 452 COVID-19 patients currently hospitalized in Utah, including 161 in intensive care, state data shows. About 84% of all intensive care unit beds in Utah were occupied as of Wednesday, including about 89% of ICU beds in the state's 16 referral hospitals, according to the health department. About 52% of non-ICU hospital beds are filled.
A total of 250,448 vaccines have been administered in the state, up from 237,637 Tuesday. Of those, 37,335 are second doses of the vaccine, according to state data.
The new numbers indicate a 0.6% increase in positive cases since Tuesday. Of the 1,989,106 people tested for COVID-19 in Utah so far, 17.1% have tested positive for the disease. The number of total tests conducted increased by 16,644 as of Wednesday, and 10,156 of those were tests of people who had not previously been tested for COVID-19, according to the health department.
The seven deaths reported Wednesday include:
- A Grand County man who was over the age of 85 and was hospitalized when he died
- A Millard County man who was between the ages of 65 and 84 and was hospitalized when he died
- A Tooele County man who was over the age of 85 and was hospitalized when he died

- A Washington County man who was between the ages of 65 and 84 and was hospitalized when he died
- A Washington County man who was between the ages of 65 and 84 and was a resident of a long-term care facility
Wednesday's totals give Utah 340,684 total confirmed cases, with 13,217 total hospitalizations and 1,620 total deaths from the disease. A total of 293,030 Utah COVID-19 cases are now considered to be recovered, according to state data.
There is not a COVID-19 news conference scheduled for Wednesday. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox is scheduled to provide a pandemic update at 11 a.m. Thursday.
Methodology:
Test results now include data from PCR tests and antigen tests. Positive COVID-19 test results are reported to the health department immediately after they are confirmed, but negative test results may not be reported for 24 to 72 hours.
The total number of cases reported by the Utah Department of Health each day includes all cases of COVID-19 since Utah's outbreak began, including those who are currently infected, those who have recovered from the disease, and those who have died.
Recovered cases are defined as anyone who was diagnosed with COVID-19 three or more weeks ago and has not died.
Referral hospitals are the 16 Utah hospitals with the capability to provide the best COVID-19 health care.
Deaths reported by the state typically occurred two to seven days prior to when they are reported, according to the health department. Some deaths may be from even further back, especially if the person is from Utah but has died in another state.
The health department reports both confirmed and probable COVID-19 case deaths per the case definition outlined by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. The death counts are subject to change as case investigations are completed.
For deaths that are reported as COVID-19 deaths, the person would not have died if they did not have COVID-19, according to the health department.

SALT LAKE CITY — If you're eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine, doctors are urging you to make an appointment and get your shot.
Doctors at University of Utah Health said the vaccination campaign is the best way to protect against another wave of the virus.
""The best vaccine is the one that's in front of you, the one that you can get most immediately,"" said Dr. Kavish Choudhary, director of pharmacy at University of Utah Health.
Doctors recently have framed Utah's community status with COVID-19 as a race between the spread of variant strains and the vaccine campaign.
Right now, Utah's doing well in that race, as long as residents keep rolling up their sleeves.
Europe is enduring another wave of COVID-19, while vaccinations have not ramped up as quickly as they have in the U.S.
""The problem in Europe really has been more that they haven't been able to vaccinate people in time at all,"" said Dr. Sankar Swaminathan, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at University of Utah Health.
The concern among doctors is the ability of the virus to mutate and evade the vaccines before we have enough immunity in the community.
""That has luckily not been a big problem here,"" said Swaminathan, adding the vaccines available appear to protect against the variants.
""If we can get everybody vaccinated, then we should be in good shape,"" he said. ""At the rate we're going, I don't think that we're going to have the variants outstripping our ability to immunize.""
""The way to cut the development of variants is to get vaccinated as soon as possible, because there's no way for the COVID virus to become mutant if there's no replication,"" said Dr. Carlos Gomez, assistant professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at University of Utah Health.

If you're eligible to get the vaccine but you're in good health, should you let somebody else go first?
""If you get offered the vaccine, you should take it,"" Gomez said.
It's important to protect ourselves and everyone else around us, he said.
""We're going to get quicker, faster to protecting the whole community,"" Gomez said.
The rollout vaccinates those who need it most, first.
""If you get offered the vaccine, that means that there's nobody who needs it more than you that has already been offered it,"" said Swaminathan.",2021-03-17T00:00:00Z,2021,1,21

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot touted a preliminary agreement with the teachers union over COVID-19 safety protocols on Sunday, potentially averting a strike in the nation's third-largest school district.
Some students could return to classrooms as soon as Thursday, with the reopening of school phased-in by grade. Also, the city agreed to vaccinate 1,500 teachers and staff weekly at vaccination sites dedicated to Chicago Public Schools. The possible deal — which still requires approval from the Chicago Teachers Union —- also includes metrics that would trigger school closings when cases spike.
The union and district have been fighting for months over a plan to gradually reopen the roughly 340,000-student district, with talks breaking down in recent days on issues including vaccinations. Lightfoot and CPS officials had threatened to lock educators out of teaching systems multiple times, which the union said would lead to a strike for the second time in less than two years.
By Sunday, the first-term mayor who had been visibly agitated at recent news conferences, was smiling.
""This agreement was about making sure everyone in our school communities just aren't safe, but also that they feel safe,"" Lightfoot said, calling the last 11 months a ""whirlwind for the entire city.""
While she called it a ""tentative agreement,"" the union characterized it as an offer that required further review.
""We do not yet have an agreement with Chicago Public Schools,"" CTU tweeted on Sunday. ""We will continue with our democratic process of rank-and-file review throughout the day before any agreement is reached.""
It was unclear when the union would begin voting. The union's house of delegates would have to decide whether to send the proposal to the roughly 25,000 members for approval.
A union spokeswoman declined to comment further.
CPS officials have said opening schools is safe and that remote learning isn't working for all students, including many Black and Latino students who make up the majority of the district. Union officials had argued that the district's plan, which included air filters in classrooms and voluntary COVID-19 tests for teachers, didn't go far enough
Under the proposal, teachers and students in pre-K and special education would return in the first wave starting Thursday. Students in K-5 would return March 1, and students in grades 6-8 would return March 8. No date was given for high school students, who would continue remote learning until further notice.
Illinois rolled out its latest vaccination phase last month that includes teachers, though supplies have been limited.
Schools CEO Janice Jackson said Sunday that 2,000 teachers and staff returning to work sooner and living ""in medically vulnerable households"" would get first dibs on vaccinations starting this week. After that, the city would begin vaccinating teachers at dedicated city sites, which is on top of a Chicago program prioritizing those who live or work in neighborhoods with the high infection rates.
The agreement also outlined metrics for temporarily suspending classroom learning districtwide — which includes seven consecutive days of test positivity rates — and for individual schools, according to CPS' outline of the deal Sunday. The district said it would continue to grant permission for some employees to continue remote teaching if they have increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 or serve as primary caregivers for someone with higher risk.
Pre-K and special education students briefly returned last month, but then stopped amid the escalating fight with the union, which voted to continue remote teaching and reject the district's plans. Teachers and students in K-8 were supposed to return Feb. 1. for the first time since going fully remote last March. The district had offered K-8 students two days of in-person instruction.
The union had said that if the district locked out teachers, as it has done previously, teachers would picket. Such a move would have cut off virtual learning for all students. The union last went on strike in 2019.
About 77,000 students from pre-K to 8 expressed interest in returning to class in a December survey. While pre-K and some special education students were offered in-person classes five days a week, students in K-8 were offered two days a week of in-person instruction with remote class on other days.
Attendance has been lower than expected.
Roughly 6,500 of the nearly 17,000 eligible preschool and special education students said they'd like to return, but only about 3,200, or 19% of those eligible, attended after the January reopening, CPS said.
The district and union have previously reached an agreement on other aspects, including ventilation and contact tracing.

SALT LAKE CITY — Research conducted by the University of Utah in 20 Granite District elementary schools and one private school provides ""one of the strongest pieces of evidence yet"" that transmission of COVID-19 in elementary schools has been very low, researcher said Friday.
""In-person schooling can be done safely with multilayered, strictly enforced prevention measures. It really enforces and reinforces the governor's recommendation that we continue masking throughout all schools in Utah at least through the end of the school year, and provides this reassurance that we do know how to make schools safe,"" said Dr. Adam Hersh, pediatric infectious disease specialist and lead investigator for the study.
Findings of the Utah Health and Economic Recovery (HERO) Project study, a collaboration between University of Utah Health and the David Eccles School of Business discussed at a press conference Friday, helped inform new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance that says with universal masking, students should maintain a distance of at least 3 feet in classroom settings.
The new guidelines still call for 6 feet of distance between adults and students as well as in common areas and when masks are off while eating.
In middle and high schools, the CDC recommends that students be at least 3 feet apart in classrooms where everyone is masked and community risk is low, moderate or substantial. Secondary students should be at least 6 feet apart in communities where COVID-19 risk is high unless they are able to meet in small groups.
CDC Director Rochelle P. Walensky, during a White House briefing Friday, said safe, in-person instruction gives children access to critical educational, social and mental health services they need to be successful.
Recent research affirms ""that K-12 schools that implement strong, layered prevention strategies can operate safely while protecting teachers, staff and students. We've seen data demonstrating that this is safe, even in areas of high community spread,"" Walensky said.
In the Beehive State, where 1 in 5 Utahns is a school-age child, 6-foot social distancing recommendations have posed challenges for educators. In some respects, Utah's unique characteristics provided researchers a glimpse of social distancing when it was not possible to meet the 6-foot recommendation precisely and the importance of other layers of mitigation.
""It goes to the testament that the fact that the protocols we're using and the mask-wearing that's being adhered to was quite effective,"" said Granite School District communication director Ben Horsley. He explained that some schools studied had class sizes above national averages while others were closer to national averages because some students in those schools elected for virtual learning.
""Obviously, there were limitations (to 6-foot social distancing recommendations) from the get-go.""
Dr. Andrew Pavia, division chief of pediatric infectious disease at the University of Utah, said the Utah classrooms conditions likely meant ""our teachers in our schools really worked extra hard on assuring safety. There may have been a paradoxical benefit to knowing that they faced a bigger challenge. They did an even better job.""
Among 21 elementary schools, researchers found five secondary cases of COVID-19 that were likely due to school exposure for a secondary attack rate of 0.7%, or seven per 1,000 contacts, Hersh said.
""In 4 out of 5 of these cases, there were obvious breakdowns in prevention strategies, including poor mask use, which helped us understand why transmission could have occurred in these instances,"" Hersh said.
""We also found that in most of the cases where the infection was presumed to have originated from school, there was secondary transmission back into their homes, which reinforces the importance of limiting in-school spread,"" he added.
In three circumstances, researchers conducted genetic sequencing to determine if infections were school or community associated.
""The genetic testing of viruses was limited, but extremely insightful,"" Hersh said.
""In all three of those instances, it was evident that the viruses were of a completely different lineage, which told us that the second case that we detected was not related to the first case and came from somewhere else outside of the school,"" he said.
A statement from the CDC said in part that the Utah study was one of many across the nation that ""affirmed CDC recommendations that schools should return to in-person learning and that doing so can be accomplished safely for the protection of students teachers in communities.""
Since in-person learning resumed in Utah schools last fall, COVID-19 transmission rates have been higher in high schools and middle schools than elementaries, but typically lower in schools than in communities.
""Given Utah's class sizes it has always been a challenge to maintain 6 feet. However, our educators have done everything possible to create safe space. These efforts have allowed us to start and hopefully finish the school year in person,"" State Superintendent of Public Instruction Sydnee Dickson said on Friday.
Larry Madden, interim superintendent of the Salt Lake City School District, said the new CDC guidance on how to safely distance students was timely as the district prepares to welcome secondary students for in-person learning four days a week starting Monday.
Related:
""We'll continue to closely follow the safety guidelines we've received and will leave additional measures, such as plexiglass barriers, in place. We are committed to doing everything we can to protect our students and staff.""
Madden continued: ""We're thankful for the many health and epidemiology experts, including the Salt Lake County Health Department, working to help keep our schools and communities safe. Our experience working with the HERO Project at our three comprehensive high schools has been incredibly positive, and we've appreciated the additional support to help us keep COVID-19 transmission at bay in our schools.""
According to the CDC, evidence suggests ""many K-12 schools that have strictly implemented prevention strategies have been able to safely open for in-person instruction and remain open.""
The agency's operational strategy presents ""a pathway for schools to provide in-person instruction safely,"" which includes ""universal and correct use of masks and physical distancing.""
Testing remains an important strategy to identify people who have COVID-19 infections. Vaccinations of teachers and staff provide additional layers of protection, according to the agency.
The new recommendations come as the state of Utah appears to be headed toward lifting a statewide mask mandate on April 10 as directed under HB294, recently passed by state lawmakers.
The bill states that the mask requirement will continue for gatherings of 50 people and more and in schools. It also does not restrict businesses from requiring masks.
The bill has not yet been signed by Gov. Spencer Cox.
Meanwhile, National Education Association President Becky Pringle expressed concern ""that the CDC has changed one of the basic rules for how to ensure school safety without demonstrating certainty that the change is justified by the science and can be implemented in a manner that does not detract from the larger long-term needs of students.""
NEA welcomes the push to provide for widespread testing, vaccination and sufficient funding for mitigation measures.
""We are so close to being able to ensure that all our schools can be so much safer. But as public health officials have rightly cautioned, in the face of new variants and a race to make vaccinations widely available, this is not the time to let down our guard,"" Pringle said in a statement.",2021-03-19T00:00:00Z,2021,1,21

LUBBOCK, Texas (Reuters) — Texans awoke on Wednesday with a statewide mask mandate and occupancy restrictions in businesses lifted, a move some heralded as freedom and others as foolishness.
On paper, Texas' rollback of coronavirus mitigation efforts is the most sweeping seen in the United States, along with a similar measure in Mississippi. In practice, vast swaths of Texas have rarely enforced mask or occupancy mandates in the past year, anyway.
Several major retailers, grocery and restaurant chains in Texas said they would still require that masks be worn in their stores, which under Abbott's order relaxing restrictions is their right to do.
Still, some expected to see standoffs between maskless customers and store employees on Wednesday.
Texas was one of the first states to reopen its economy after the first wave of pandemic cases last May, and the nation's second-most populous state led the way again last week when Gov. Greg Abbott announced the relaxation amid declines in new daily COVID-19 cases and with the rollout of vaccines.
As of Sunday, 18% of the U.S. population had received at least one dose of a vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
County officials in regions where COVID patients take up 15% or more of hospital beds for seven consecutive days can enact new mask and occupancy restrictions, under Abbott's order, but no regions are currently in that situation.
Austin's City Council voted to still require masks — and dared state officials to sue the city.
""In Austin, we're committed to saving lives,"" City Council member Greg Casar wrote on Twitter.
The Texas Education Agency's guidance for public schools is for the continued use of masks, while nursing homes in the state will not loosen restrictions.
The Dallas Jewish Conservatives organization plans to host a party Wednesday evening with about 200 people. There will be a moment of silence for the pandemic's dead, refreshments for the guests and a bonfire into which folks will be encouraged to toss masks.
""It's about freedom, liberty and personal responsibility,"" said Benjie Gershon, founder of the group. ""The act of throwing a mask into the bonfire ... is in no way meant to belittle or undermine the tragic numbers of individuals who have fallen ill to COVID.""

SALT LAKE CITY — Utah's number of COVID-19 cases increased by 584 on Monday, with three more deaths reported, according to the Utah Department of Health.
That marks the lowest single-day new COVID-19 case total since September. It's the second time in the new year Utah has reported under 1,000 cases, along with 859 new cases reported on Jan. 25.
The health department estimates there are now 37,692 active cases of COVID-19 in Utah. Monday's rolling seven-day average number of positive cases per day is 1,425, according to the health department. The positive test rate per day for that time period is now 16.7%.
There are 402 COVID-19 patients currently hospitalized in Utah, including 129 in intensive care, state data shows. About 80% of all intensive care unit beds in Utah hospitals are occupied Monday, including about 82% of ICU beds in the state's 16 referral hospitals. About 54% of all Utah hospital beds are occupied, according to the health department.
Vaccinations update from Gov. Cox
A total of 311,785 vaccines have been administered in the state, up from 310,692 Sunday. Of those, 63,711 are second doses of the vaccine.
Gov. Spencer Cox told KSL NewsRadio's Lee Lonsberry that Utah's vaccination distribution rate has seen an uptick in recent weeks. In the last two weeks, the state has burned through its vaccine backlog; every dose since has been distributed within seven days, Cox said.
""That's just huge news for our state,"" Cox said in a Monday interview.
But, things aren't perfect, he said, and ""we just need more vaccines."" According to the governor, President Joe Biden's administration has promised states that more doses are on the way.
""That's just great for everyone,"" Cox said.
The state is still getting about 33,000-40,000 first vaccine doses per week, and Cox said the state's rolling seven-day average of vaccine administration won't increase until more vaccine doses are given to Utah.
""That's what's kind of holding us back now,"" Cox said.
Davis County Health Department announced on Monday that it has received additional vaccines and has new appointments available on its website.
The next big change will come when the new vaccines currently under development get approved for use, like the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, he said. When that happens, the state anticipates it will jump from about 33,000 doses per week to 70,000 per week. After the AstraZeneca vaccine is approved for use, that number will likely increase to more than 100,000 doses per week.
""If we're getting our 100,000 per week, now we can really impact things fast and save lives and get back to normal much more quickly than we expected,"" Cox said.
The state is currently in the process of getting its infrastructure ready to handle such large distribution amounts in preparation for the expected distribution increase.
Utah hospitalizations and deaths
Monday's new numbers indicate a 0.2% increase in positive cases since Sunday. Of the 2,028,163 people tested for COVID-19 in Utah so far, 17.1% have tested positive for the disease. The total number of tests conducted increased by 4,818 as of Monday, and 3,516 of those were tests of people who had not previously been tested for COVID-19, according to the health department.
Summit County officials reported that a third resident tested positive for the COVID-19 variant commonly referred to as the ""U.K. variant."" According to officials, the resident is a woman between the ages of 20 and 44 years old. The U.K. variant is believed to be more contagious than other strains of the coronavirus, but COVID-19 vaccines are believed to be effective against the strain.
The three deaths reported Monday include:
- A Box Elder County man who was between the ages of 45 and 64 and was a resident of a long-term care facility
- A Salt Lake County man who was between the ages of 65 and 84 and was hospitalized when he died
- A Utah County man who was between the ages of 65 and 84 and was hospitalized when he died
Monday's totals give Utah 347,208 total confirmed cases, with 13,515 total hospitalizations and 1,668 total deaths from the disease. A total of 307,848 Utah COVID-19 cases are now considered recovered, state data shows.
Cox is scheduled to provide a pandemic update at 11 a.m. Thursday, according to the governor's office.
Methodology:
Test results now include data from PCR tests and antigen tests. Positive COVID-19 test results are reported to the health department immediately after they are confirmed, but negative test results may not be reported for 24 to 72 hours.
The total number of cases reported by the Utah Department of Health each day includes all cases of COVID-19 since Utah's outbreak began, including those who are currently infected, those who have recovered from the disease, and those who have died.
Recovered cases are defined as anyone who was diagnosed with COVID-19 three or more weeks ago and has not died.
Referral hospitals are the 16 Utah hospitals with the capability to provide the best COVID-19 health care.
Deaths reported by the state typically occurred two to seven days prior to when they are reported, according to the health department. Some deaths may be from even further back, especially if the person is from Utah but has died in another state.
The health department reports both confirmed and probable COVID-19 case deaths per the case definition outlined by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. The death counts are subject to change as case investigations are completed.
For deaths that are reported as COVID-19 deaths, the person would not have died if they did not have COVID-19, according to the health department.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair expects a record loss of close to 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in the year to March 31 before what Chief Executive Michael O'Leary says will be a ""dramatic recovery"" later in the year thanks to COVID-19 vaccination programmes.
The Irish low-cost airline, Europe's largest, forecast a loss between 850 million and 950 million euros in its current financial year - about five times larger than its previous record loss in 2009.
But O'Leary told an investor call that bookings would ""snap back very strongly"" once confidence grows in the rollout of vaccines across the European Union.
""I would be reasonably confident ... that we will see a return to relatively high-volume travel in that key July, August, September quarter,"" he said.
Traffic is likely to be 20-25% of pre-pandemic levels between April and June, rising to 50-70% between July and September, depending on the success of the European Union's vaccine programme, O'Leary said, with winter traffic potentially at 75-100%.
""We are somewhat in the lap of the gods,"" he acknowledged, adding that the airline could carry between 80 million and 120 million passengers in the coming financial year, compared with the 150 million in the year before COVID-19.
Ryanair is widely seen as one of the best-placed airlines to weather the COVID-19 crisis thanks to its large cash balance and lack of long-haul and business-class flights.
It said it had cash on hand of 3.5 billion euros at the end of December, compared with 4.5 billion euros at the end of September and O'Leary said he does not currently see any scenario in which it would need to raise more cash this year.
The airline will move very quickly to exploit opportunities created by the retrenchment of rivals, including in Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain, he said.
""I would be prepared to grow aggressively in the winter of 2021, even on lower air fares,"" he said.
COVID-19 restrictions slashed Ryanair passenger numbers by 78% in the last three months of 2020, pushing it to a third-quarter loss of 306 million euros, slightly better than the 300 million euro loss forecast in a company poll of analysts.
Ryanair said it expects its first delivery of Boeing's 737 MAX in March, with at least 24 of the 210 it has on order arriving in time for its peak summer season. The 737 MAX was cleared to return to service late last year, having been grounded globally in March 2019 following deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
Ryanair's share price was down 0.3% at 14.25 euros by 1310 GMT, 16% below its pre-COVID peak of 16.90 euros on Jan. 10 last year.

SALT LAKE CITY — Education, rural infrastructure, transportation, affordable housing and homelessness were among the big winners as lawmakers moved Friday to approve this year's budget, but the work isn't done, with lawmakers still grappling with much to bond for infrastructure projects.
The Legislature's Executive Appropriations Committee met briefly Friday evening to approve the budget, which set an additional $238.6 million in ongoing funds and $676.6 million in one-time funding to the state's budget.
""The big winners are the citizens of the state of Utah,"" Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, told the Deseret News in an interview. ""You can't pick one winner. There's too many to mention, and when you think you've got them all, you've missed one. And that's amazing in the middle of a pandemic.""
New revenue estimates released earlier this month showed lawmakers had over $1.5 billion in extra money to spend this year despite the COVID-19 pandemic, including about $1.3 billion in one-time dollars and $205 million in ongoing funding. That's after lawmakers already made what they called ""historic"" early commitments toward education when they included a 6% weighted-pupil unit increase and $121 million for $1,500 teacher bonuses in the base budgets passed in the early days of the 2021 session. Those boosts to education totaled about $400 million.
The budget approved in committee Friday added another $31.7 million in ongoing money and $44.8 million in one-time money for public education, spread across multiple programs and initiatives, including $7 million for optional enhanced kindergarten.
This year's spending boosts come after lawmakers last year cut the state's more than $20 billion total budget amid fears of economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. But with better-than-expected revenues, the Legislature this year is moving to restore many of those cuts.
Related:
Lawmakers are also moving to fund a $100 million tax cut package, targeted at Utah seniors, veterans and families with children.
""If you were to tell me a year ago when we were shutting down the economy in the middle of a pandemic, when we were self-isolating and we were all at home wondering what our economic future was, that we would be able to, the very next budget year, fund education, give teachers bonuses, to fund Medicaid expansion and to fund growth in Medicaid, to fund $50 million for affordable housing ... and do a tax cut?"" Adams said. ""The state of Utah is the winner.""
The spending plan still left about half of the $1.3 billion in one-time revenues unappropriated — meaning lawmakers still have more to put toward infrastructure investments. Thursday, House lawmakers unveiled a massive, $2.26 billion transportation proposal, including $1.4 billion in bonding, but House and Senate leaders still disagree on whether the state should take on that much debt.
That issue, Senate Budget Chairman Jerry Stevenson, R-Layton, will be hashed out over the next week. The session ends next March 5.
""Again, in the middle of the pandemic, it's unbelievable to be able to balance lives and livelihoods to keep the economy going and to try to protect people's lives,"" Adams said. ""I think we've done a decent job. The vaccines are coming out. The future's bright. It's a great day.""
House Speaker Brad Wilson, R-Kaysville, earlier Friday told reporters this year's budget process has been one of the ""smoothest"" he's ever experienced.
""It could have been a lot more difficult,"" he said, given the amount of extra money that could have been fought over.
Granted, lawmakers still need to decide how much they should bond for infrastructure, but Wilson said he's proud of where the state of Utah stands.
From a tax cut, to historic investments in education and infrastructure, ""these things are only happening in one place in the whole country, and they are happening here,"" Wilson said. ""We still have work to do ... but our state's future is very bright.""
Stevenson said much of the rural project investment ""comes with our new governor."" Gov. Spencer Cox, from Fairview, Sanpete County, promised along the campaign trail that he'd prioritize rural communities as governor. Stevenson said those investments are ""much deserved"" for rural Utahns.
""We'd like to disperse the prosperity we have had along the Wasatch Front, spread it across the state,"" Stevenson said.
Senate Minority Whip Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, was happy to see $50 million for housing and homelessness, but she said there were ""still a lot of things missing"" that she and her Democratic colleagues would have liked to see in the budget, including continuous eligibility for children on Medicaid.
""But we're still working,"" she said. ""It's not the end. There's still a week.""
Some highlights in the budget include:
- Over $273.5 million in one-time and $23.8 million in ongoing money for economic development initiatives. That includes $115 million for the state to create a state ""bank"" or revolving loan funds to help cities and counties fund project areas, with $75 million set aside for Utah Inland Port Authority project areas. That fund also includes $40 million mostly for loans for rural broadband infrastructure, according to House staff.
- $10 million in one-time and $200,000 ongoing for rural fiber, broadband and Wi-Fi internet infrastructure.
- $8 million in one-time and $800,000 in ongoing money for operations — each — for the Utah Inland Port Authority and the Point of the Mountain State Land Authority.
- $39 million money for trails, outdoor recreation and parks.
- An additional $67.5 million could be set aside for enhancements to existing state parks if the current infrastructure plan is approved, as well as $36 million for newly proposed Utahraptor and Lost Creek state parks.
- Over $200 million for new buildings, many for colleges and universities across the state. That includes more than $37 million for a Bridgerland Health and Science and Technology Building in Logan, nearly $7.5 million for a Brigham City public safety building, $15 million for a Dixie State University Land Bank, $31.6 million for Salt Lake Community College's Herriman campus general education building, $42.2 million for a Southern Utah University Academic Classroom Building, and $59.3 million for a University of Utah Applied Sciences Building.
- Over $56.6 million switched from one-time to ongoing accounts to fix a structural imbalance for the state's Medicaid Expansion fund, with enrollment outpacing revenues.
- State employees will receive a 3% cost-of-living raise, restored from last year's budget cuts. Lawmakers also prioritized $5 million to give raises for the state's Division of Child and Family Services caseworkers.
- $50 million in one-time money for homelessness and housing, restoring an affordable housing bill approved last year that was defunded when the pandemic struck.
At least one thing that hasn't been included in the state budget was $50 million sought by Cox for a solution to traffic gridlock in Big and Little Cottonwood canyons — ski areas that attract visitors across from the nation. Studies are still being conducted to pick the best strategy, but one that has caught the interest of the governor is a gondola up Little Cottonwood Canyon.
Wilson said earlier Friday lawmakers hadn't moved to fund that this year because the issue is still being studied, and they'd rather not see that amount of money go unused for years while stakeholders continue to sort out how to spend it.",2021-02-27T00:00:00Z,2021,1,21

SALT LAKE CITY — We've now entered the 2021 portion of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has already been met with cautious optimism by public health officials for a few reasons.
Unlike in the beginning of the pandemic in the state back in March 2020, there is now a vaccine that is available to combat the spread of the coronavirus. That said, the rollout of the vaccine has gone slower than expected. The Utah Department of Health's immunization leader said last week that despite vaccinations ramping up at the end of 2020, he anticipated there will probably be delays in the state's original timetable for certain groups to receive the vaccine.
The health department and other Utah health care experts are still keeping close tabs on the current COVID-19 statistics to see if the December holidays like Christmas and New Year's Eve will lead to another uptick in cases and hospitalizations.
Utah's seven-day rolling average of new cases per day was 2,800 on Tuesday, which is on the rise but still not as high as the 2020 peak of 3,364.6 cases per day recorded on Nov. 22. There are also nearly 100 fewer current hospitalizations from COVID-19 as compared to the 2020 high of 606 set on Dec. 4.
That said, the health department reported Monday that Utah's seven-day rolling average of case positivity rate crept over 30% for the first time as it continues to rise. It was 32.1% as of Tuesday, although the figure is backdated to Dec. 30 to account for more complete results of all tests taken on that day.
Since it is the new year, here's a review of current statistics and storylines in Utah to get a better view of the pandemic at the beginning of 2021.
Utah's COVID-19 situation in the 1st week of 2021
There have been 288,951 total COVID-19 cases in Utah, 11,356 Utahns hospitalized by COVID-19, and 1,312 deaths as a result of the coronavirus since March 2020. In addition, over 1.7 million Utahns have been tested a total of more than 2.7 million times.
Of course, that's a long stretch of time and most of the cases reported — a little over 236,000 in all — have resulted in reported recoveries. That's not to say all of those recoveries still don't suffer from coronavirus-related complications, but those who test positive for COVID-19 and survive are marked as ""recovered"" three weeks after they tested positive.
As of Tuesday, here is what the state's COVID-19 situation looks like on a more current scale:
- 2,800 seven-day running average of cases per day
- 51,443 active COVID-19 cases
- Average of about 16,021 total tests per day over past seven days (note: some of these are not new people tested)
- 32.1% seven-day rolling average test positivity rate
- 66.9 seven-day rolling average COVID-19 hospitalizations by day (note: some new hospitalizations not reported yet)
- 510 current hospitalizations due to COVID-19
- 84% statewide intensive care unit utilization (86% at referral centers)
- 43 deaths reported since New Year (note: some likely from the end of 2020)
- 55,981 Utahns vaccinated
- 150,125 vaccine doses shipped to Utah
Was there a post-holiday uptick?
It's simply too early to tell if the holiday season will factor into a rise in new cases. COVID-19 cases are on the rise but it's unclear if that's due to holiday gatherings or because testing numbers are starting to return to levels closer to where they were prior to the holiday season.
Dr. Todd Vento, an infectious disease physician for Intermountain Healthcare, pointed out on Monday that the incubation period following New Year's isn't over yet. It means that officials should be able to determine if there was a holiday-related spike in the coming days and weeks.
If there was an uptick in new cases due to holiday events, it's likely that rise won't be reflected in hospitals until mid-to-late January, Vento explained. Health care experts have pinpointed that new cases usually don't result in an increase of new hospitalizations until a week or two after the case uptick begins.
Utah's rising positivity rate
The state's positivity rate is one statistic that could indicate a post-holiday rise. The rate increased even when testing declined and then began to rebound last month. After it steadily rose beginning on Dec. 13, the seven-day test positivity rate has really skyrocketed over the past few data updates.
Utah's seven-day rolling positivity rate figure hit 25.8% on Christmas Day and then jumped to 32.1% by Dec. 30, which is what was reported Tuesday. Health officials have explained in the past that a higher rate typically indicates that there are widespread unreported cases, such as asymptomatic cases or people who don't get tested.
""We worry that we're not testing enough and that there may be more out there,"" Vento said. ""In order to interpret the test positivity, I would certainly look at the trend over time with the average of it and every day you look at cases, look at the test positivity and look at the number of tests.""
Utah's rate is very high, especially since the target goal for states is about 5%. Utah last met that threshold around Memorial Day in May 2020. The rate has remained over 20% since the end of October, as well. Some of the new COVID-19 case count figures provided by the health department since Dec. 30 indicate unofficial single-day positivity rates up to 40%.
Instead of looking at ramping up testing to potentially lower the positivity rate, Vento said that more testing needs to be done to ""seek the truth"" and figure how many cases really are in Utah to get a better idea of how it is spreading. Even then, he argued increasing testing may not lower the positivity rate quite like some might believe.
""What's going to get us to the improvement in the test positivity is not testing more, it's doing mitigation measures — adding the vaccine, all the tools in our toolbox that have proven to stop infections with the virus,"" he said. ""And so testing is important, but that's not how you get yourself out of a pandemic.""
Students return to class
The start of the new year means students will return to the classroom and college campuses. The Utah System of Higher Education released on Tuesday its ""intensive testing plan"" to comply with a health order issued late last year by Utah Department of Health executive director Rich Saunders, who was the interim director under Gov. Gary Herbert that time.
The higher education plan calls for ""entry testing,"" which means that all students who will live on campus or travel to campus in Utah must be tested within 10 days of the spring semester beginning. After that, there is a plan to conduct randomized surveillance testing that will help ""institutions to understand campus infection trends and identify students with current infection.""
It also calls for institutions to ensure testing happens within 24 hours of a student notifying them of symptoms. There's also close contact testing that would be conducted after contact tracing and ""focused testing,"" which includes wastewater testing, symptom check surveys, ""other randomized or mandatory"" testing, contact tracing and regularly testing athletes on campus.
In the meantime, Vento explained there is the possibility that a return of students on campus and extracurricular activities could factor in COVID-19 spread.
""That would be a concern just based on the sheer numbers,"" he said. ""If you want to talk about the potential for the concept of a super-spreader event, you bring 20-30-40,000 people back together who haven't been together and who have been traveling possibly — and now they're all together again.""
He added that the testing as students return could help minimize the impacts of spread because cases might be identified sooner.
What's up with the new coronavirus strain?
2020 came to an end with a new strain of COVID-19 found in the United Kingdom that prompted worldwide concern. There's no evidence that the strain is deadlier than what was previously known about COVID-19 or that it could slip past vaccines but if it is more transmissible, which scientists say it is, then it might mean more people who get sick in a shorter amount of time.
The variant has since been discovered in over 30 countries, including the United States. It's been identified in cases within California, Colorado and Florida. While it hasn't been recorded in Utah, Dr. Eddie Stenehjem, one of Intermountain Healthcare's other infectious disease physicians, said last month that it's likely that it has already arrived in the state based on how long it took for scientists to find it and then sound the alarm after that.
One reason why it's very possible that it has arrived in Utah is that it doesn't appear the U.S. cases had any ties to the U.K.
""There's no evidence on those specific cases in the United States that they had any travel or any exposure to any individuals who had traveled to the United Kingdom or to countries where there was documented transmission of that strain,"" Vento said. ""Basically what that means is we have community transmission of that viral strain in our country.
""Is that surprising? No. We expected that.""
More cases are expected to be found as states send positive test results to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for analysis in the coming days and weeks, Vento added.
Vaccinations are on the rise but there's still work to do
Tuesday's update that 55,981 Utahns have received the vaccine means that the state has doubled its total vaccinations over the past week. Per health department data, the number of all COVID-19 vaccines administered as of Tuesday is a little more than 2½ times higher than it was Dec. 29.
It came after Rich Lakin, immunization program manager for the Utah Department of Health, admitted last week that the initial rollout of the vaccine was ""slower than what we had anticipated and really slower than what we wanted.""
One reason for the faster pace is more groups outside of the original hospital front-line workers, like firefighters, EMTs and paramedics, are receiving the vaccines. Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are administered in two doses. The second round of doses began this week.
Still, there's much more vaccinating that must happen to achieve herd immunity. That's why current case numbers and hospitalizations are still very relevant and will continue to be so for the next few months.
Since we began administering COVID-19 vaccines, the process has been extremely efficient. 55% of our health care team members have received the vaccine so far. The protection allows them to continue providing quality health care to COVID-19 patients and all our community. pic.twitter.com/IYnM7xELRh
— University of Utah Health (@UofUHealth) January 6, 2021
Lakin said the speed of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout essentially depends on how fast Utah can receive doses from the federal government. The slower the pace, the more time it will take to get people vaccinated.
""If we don't have enough vaccine, we can't move through the populations we'd like to because we can't supply enough vaccines to our local health departments because the speed of them vaccinating is currently quicker than the amount of vaccine that we can get them,"" he said.
So, yes, that means that public health experts still recommend that people wear masks and physically distance themselves around those outside of their own households. That's on top of other public health measures like people staying at home when they are sick and washing their hands thoroughly.
""The message isn't going to change because the calendar year changed, the message is still the same,"" Vento said. ""You have to wear a mask 100% of the time whenever you're in public and in contact with others. And you have to stop gathering — keeping your physical distancing. At a minimum, if you're going to be gathering, try to do it outdoors and certainly wear a mask where both individuals are going to have a mask on.""",2021-01-05T00:00:00Z,2021,1,21

BOISE, Idaho (AP) — The Idaho Legislature voted Friday to shut down for several weeks due to an outbreak of COVID-19.
Lawmakers in the House and Senate made the move to recess until April 6 with significant unfinished business, including setting budgets and pushing through a huge income tax cut.
At least six of the 70 House members tested positive for the illness in the last week, and there are fears a highly contagious variant of COVID-19 is in the Statehouse.
""The House has had several positive tests, so it is probably prudent that the House take a step back for a couple weeks until things calm down and it's not hot around here for COVID,"" House Majority Leader Mike Moyle said before the votes.
Five of those who tested positive are Republicans and one is Democrat. Another Republican lawmaker is self-isolating. The chamber has a super-majority of 58 Republicans, most of whom rarely or never wear masks. All the Democratic lawmakers typically wear masks.
The three lawmakers who tested positive this week, two Republicans and one Democrat, had all been participating in debates on the House floor.
The House, with the illness spreading, requested the Senate recess as well. Two senators contracted COVID-19 but have recovered and returned to the 35-member Senate.
The Senate honored the House request and voted to recess about an hour after the House, with Republican Senate President Pro-Tem Chuck Winder calling it ""an unusual and kind of historic request that has been made of us.""
Republican Sen. Majority Leader Kelly Anthon said senators could use the time to prepare for when the Senate convenes again. ""We will use this time productively for the Idaho people so that when we come back together on April 6, we will be ready to work quickly,"" he said.
Republican House Speaker Scott Bedke said after the votes that the delay could be good because it could give the Legislature time to figure out how to spend the $2.2 billion the state is receiving in the latest round of federal coronavirus relief money.
Republican leaders in the House and Senate, who control both chambers, didn't impose a mask mandate this session.
The House has had several positive tests, so it is probably prudent that the House take a step back for a couple weeks until things calm down and it's not hot around here for COVID.
–Idaho House Majority Leader Mike Moyle
""I think maybe when they come back, maybe it will be different,"" Bedke said. ""But I have no regrets on the safety protocols here to this point.""
Lawmakers will be paid the per diem rates to cover their normal session-related living expenses during the recess, and secretaries and attachés will also be paid during the break. Bedke characterized it as essentially a long weekend that many will use to catch up on paperwork and other business.
A major goal of GOP lawmakers in the Legislature this session has been curbing the emergency powers of the Republican governor to respond to things like pandemics. Legislators have floated several proposals that would restrict Gov. Brad Little's ability to make sweeping directives in the future.
The House has also been advancing a bill that would ban local governments from requiring that people wear masks. Little, who wears a mask in public and encourages others to do so, has never issued a statewide mask mandate, but a handful of counties and about a dozen cities currently have such orders in place.
In a joint statement, Democratic House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel and Democratic Senate Minority Leader Michelle Stennett said they hoped that their colleagues ill with COVID-19 recovered.
""But we can't help but be disappointed in how bad things have become at the Capitol, when we could've prevented this from becoming a hot spot all along,"" they said. ""We are just so sorry it took so many people getting sick for us to act. We must do better when we return, or else we'll keep finding ourselves in this position.""
Besides the eight lawmakers known to have contracted COVID-19, a handful of House and Senate staffers also are known to have contracted the virus this session.
During the recess, the lawmakers are expected to travel home to all parts of the state, potentially spreading the variant of the virus.
Dr. David Peterman, a pediatrician and CEO of Primary Health Medical Group, said Thursday that 30% to 40% of positive tests at the health group's facilities in southwestern Idaho were the variant.
About 175,000 Idaho residents have been infected with the coronavirus, and more than 1,900 have died. But about 200,000 residents have received both shots of the two-shot vaccine, and another 125,000 have received the first shot. About 1.8 million people live in the state.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Joe Biden is enjoying an early presidential honeymoon, with 60% of Americans approving of his job performance thus far and even more backing his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
At a moment of deep political polarization in America, support for Biden's pandemic response extends across party lines. Overall, 70% of Americans back the Democratic president's handling of the virus response, including 44% of Republicans.
Still, Biden faces more skepticism from Americans on the economy, which has been battered by the pandemic. Fifty-five percent of Americans approve of Biden's approach to the economy thus far, and 63% say the U.S. economy is in poor shape, the AP-NORC survey shows. Republicans are also less likely to back Biden on the economy than they are on the pandemic, with just 17% supporting his fiscal stewardship.
Less than two months into his presidency, Biden has made the pandemic his central focus, urging Americans to follow stringent social distancing and mask guidelines and vowing to speed up distribution of critical vaccines. He's also argued that until the spread of the virus is under control, the economy won't fully recover.
To address financial shortfalls in the meantime, he's asking Congress to pass a $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue plan that would provide direct payments to millions of Americans and surge funds into state and local governments.
The measure has already passed the House. But Biden is having to make compromises to keep all Democratic senators in support of the measure, including agreeing this week to narrow eligibility for $1,400 stimulus checks. In a concession to moderate Democratic senators, Biden agreed that individuals making more than $80,000 annually and couples making more than $160,000 won't receive any benefits. Biden's original proposal extended the stimulus funds to Americans with higher annual wages.
The administration estimates that 158.5 million households will still receive checks under the Senate compromise.
The prospect of a pandemic relief bill is welcome news to John Villegas, 58, an Illinois Democrat who supports Biden's handling of both the virus response and the economy.
""With the closure of so many businesses, there are a lot of people suffering,"" said Villegas, who called Biden's approach a ""180 degree shift"" from his predecessor, Donald Trump.
Trump argued that the U.S. economy couldn't afford the hit that came from enacting restrictions on business and travel. The worst fears of economists were averted as Republican-led states followed Trump's lead and resisted restrictions, but COVID-19 cases skyrocketed. More than 520,000 people have died in the United States from the virus over the past year.
Despite their differing approaches to managing the economy during the pandemic, Biden's approval ratings on the economy are similar to Trump's, whose handling of the economy since the virus took hold was consistently backed by about half of Americans. The key difference: That level of support made the economy Trump's strongest issue, while it's a relative weakness for Biden compared with Americans' views of his handling of the pandemic and other issues.
In a reflection of the partisanship that continues to rage in the U.S., many Americans' views of the economy have flipped since the new president was inaugurated. In December, 67% of Republicans and just 15% of Democrats described the economy as good. Now, 35% of Republicans and 41% of Democrats describe the economy positively. There's been little change in overall growth or unemployment over that time.
Biden's handling of the pandemic may well determine the course of his presidency and the political capital he has to pursue significant legislation on other matters. Democrats are working urgently to tee up bills addressing infrastructure investment, policing reforms and voting rights. Biden has also vowed to tackle climate change and build on the sprawling health insurance measure signed into law when he served as Barack Obama's vice president.
His promises of action have garnered him solid approval ratings on some of those fronts. For example, about 6 in 10 Americans say they approve of Biden's handling of health care and race relations.
Overall, 48% of Americans say the country is headed in the right direction, compared with 37% who said that in December. The poll also shows that 43% of Americans expect things in the country overall to get better in the next year, while 34% think things will get worse and 23% think they will remain about the same.
Biden himself has been purposefully cautious in predicting when life in the U.S. will return to a pre-pandemic normal. Even as he promises that the U.S. will have enough vaccine supply for all Americans by the end of May, he's said it could be the end of the year or early 2022 before Americans can stop wearing masks or fully return to normal activities.
His team's goal in setting expectations? Underpromise, then overdeliver.
The AP-NORC poll of 1,434 adults was conducted Feb. 23-March 1 using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.

BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Struggling with surging COVID-19 infections, several Balkan countries said on Wednesday that they would step up restrictions in hopes of easing the pressure on their overburdened health systems.
Doctors in Bosnia's capital of Sarajevo warned that infections have ""exploded"" in recent days and urged people to comply with pandemic regulations. Illustrating the rise in infections, long queues of people waiting to see doctors formed outside COVID-19 wards and outpatient clinics in the city.
On a positive note, the first AstraZeneca vaccine doses donated by neighboring Serbia, were administered in Sarajevo on Wednesday.
Bosnian authorities said that all bars, restaurants and non-essential shops in the Sarajevo canton will be shut during this weekend.
More than 1,000 new infections and 37 deaths over the past 24 hours were reported on Wednesday.
""These are hard days, and once again we appeal to citizens to be maximally vigilant and to take care so they can help us to keep the health system stable,"" said Ismet Gavrankapetanovic, head of the Sarajevo General Hospital.
In Serbia, Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said the government-appointed virus crisis body most likely will meet on Thursday to decide on tighter measures for the upcoming weekend.
The country of 7 million has given more than 1,5 million people at least one dose from an array of vaccines including China's Sinopharm, Pfizer-BioNTech, Russia's Sputnik V, and Astra-Zeneca, placing Serbia among countries with the highest vaccination rates in Europe. Nonetheless, Serbia is reporting more than 4,000 new infections daily and doctors have described the situation as alarming.
The government has launched a campaign to encourage people who have not yet been inoculated to do so. Experts have blamed the recent surge on flouting of the rules, and the fact that ski resorts remained open throughout the winter season.
Brnabic also criticized the holding in the past days of two concerts by a popular band at a Belgrade hall, saying authorities will ban all concerts in the future. Brnabic insisted that ""we will demand that the organizers be punished.""
In neighboring Montenegro, health authorities said schools will shift to remote instruction, while daycare centers, bars and fitness centers will close as part additional measures imposed by the small nation of 620,000.
Montenegro has had among the highest infection and death rates in Europe with more than 80,000 infections and over 1,000 deaths. Authorities said on Wednesday that if the situation worsens they may ask the European Union to send in medical staff to help.
Montenegro's health officials said that so far, approximately 70% of hospital beds in the small Adriatic state are occupied because of the virus outbreak.
In North Macedonia, a nationwide, two-week curfew will take effect on Wednesday from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.
Authorities in the Balkan country of 2.1 million recorded last week a 60% increase in infections over the previous week. Most of the newly-admitted patients carry the the U.K. variant.

ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Disneyland is ending its annual pass program 10 months after the theme park shut down because of the coronavirus pandemic, the theme park said Thursday.
The park in Anaheim, California, said it would begin issuing pro-rated refunds to eligible passholders.
""Due to the continued uncertainty of the pandemic and limitations around the reopening of our California theme parks, we will be issuing appropriate refunds for eligible Disneyland Resort Annual Passports and sunsetting the current program,"" Ken Potrock, president of Disneyland Resort, said in a statement. He said the park will develop new membership offerings for when it can reopen.
Disney officials would not say how many people hold these passes or how much the move will cost the company.
The announcement comes the same week that Disneyland allowed county health officials to use its parking lot for a large-scale coronavirus vaccination site.
Disneyland closed in March and has not reopened since because coronavirus metrics in the county where the park is located have not declined to the levels required by the state.
California health officials have said large amusement parks like Disneyland can only reopen once transmission reaches minimal levels, and then park capacity will be limited to 25% and reservations required.
California has seen a surge in coronavirus cases in recent months that has prompted a shutdown of many businesses and nighttime curfews in much of the state.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) — The United States squandered both money and lives in its response to the coronavirus pandemic, and it could have avoided nearly 400,000 deaths with a more effective health strategy and trimmed federal spending by hundreds of billions of dollars while still supporting those who needed it.
That is the conclusion of a group of research papers released at a Brookings Institution conference this week, offering an early and broad start to what will likely be an intense effort in coming years to assess the response to the worst pandemic in a century.
U.S. COVID-19 fatalities could have stayed under 300,000, versus a death toll of 540,000 and rising, if by last May the country had adopted widespread mask, social distancing, and testing protocols while awaiting a vaccine, estimated Andrew Atkeson, economics professor at University of California, Los Angeles.
He likened the state-by-state, patchwork response to a car's cruise control. As the virus worsened people hunkered down, but when the situation improved restrictions were dropped and people were less careful, with the result that ""the equilibrium level of daily deaths ... remains in a relatively narrow band"" until the vaccine arrived.
Atkeson projected a final fatality level of around 670,000 as vaccines spread and the crisis subsides. The outcome, had no vaccine been developed, would have been a far-worse 1.27 million, Atkeson estimated.
The economic response, while mammoth, also could have been better tailored, argued University of California, Berkeley economics professor Christine Romer. She joins former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and several others from the last two Democratic administrations in criticizing the spending authorized since last spring, including the Biden team's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan.
While she said the federal government's more than $5 trillion in pandemic-related spending won't likely trigger a fiscal crisis, she worries that higher-priority investments will be deferred because of allocations to initiatives like the Paycheck Protection Program.

Those forgivable small business loans were ""an interesting and noble experiment,"" but were also ""problematic on many levels,"" including an apparent cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars for each job saved, she said.
""Spending on programs such as unemployment compensation and public heath was exactly what was called for,"" she wrote, but other aspects, particularly the generous one-time payments to families, were ""largely ineffective and wasteful.""
""If something like the $1 trillion spent on stimulus payments that did little to help those most affected by the pandemic ends up precluding spending $1 trillion on infrastructure or climate change in the next few years, the United States will have made a very bad bargain indeed,"" Romer wrote.
Biden administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, argue the full package was needed to be sure all workers and families are kept economically intact until the job market recovers.
In a separate paper, Minneapolis Federal Reserve researchers Krista Ruffini and Abigail Wozniak concluded the federal programs largely did what they intended by supporting income and spending, with the impact seen in how consumption changed in response to the approval and lapse of different government payments.
But they also found room for improvement.
Evidence of the PPP's effectiveness in job retention, for example, was ""mixed,"" they found, and increases in food assistance didn't account for things like higher grocery prices.
""Food insecurity remained elevated throughout 2020,"" they noted.
The aim now, they said, should be on determining what worked in order to make the response to any similar crisis more effective.
""The 2020 social insurance system response had many successes,"" they said. ""Given the scope and scale of the pandemic response, it is critical we continue to evaluate these efforts to understand the full extent of their reach, which populations were helped, who was left out.""

WASHINGTON (AP) — The nation's top public health agency on Friday provided a roadmap for reopening schools in the middle of a pandemic, emphasizing mask wearing and social distancing and saying vaccination of teachers is important but not a prerequisite for reopening.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the long-awaited update, but it cannot force schools to reopen, and agency officials were careful to say they are not calling for a mandate that all U.S. schools be reopened.
They said there is strong evidence now that in-person schooling can be done safely, especially at lower grade levels, and the guidance is targeted at schools that teach kindergarten up to 12th grade.
The agency also emphasized hand washing, disinfection of school facilities, diagnostic testing and contact tracing to find new infections and separate infected people from others in a school.
The guidance was issued as President Joe Biden faces increasing pressure to deliver on his promise to get the majority of schools back to in-person teaching by the end of his first 100 days in office. The White House said this week that a national strategy would be guided by science.
There's wide agreement that learning in the classroom is more effective and that students can face isolation and learning setbacks at home. But teachers unions in some areas say schools have failed to make buildings safe enough to return.
CDC officials emphasized that in-person learning has not been identified as a substantial driver of coronavirus spread in U.S. communities, and that transmission among students is now considered relatively rare.
The CDC also stressed that the safest way to open schools is by making sure there is as little disease in a community as possible. The agency urged local officials to assess whether a bad outbreak is occurring in a community when making decisions about sending adults and children in to schools.
The guidance included a color-coded chart, from blue to red, on assessing community spread, including rates of new cases per 100,000 people and the percentage of positive tests.

That said, high community transmission does not necessarily mean schools cannot be open — especially those at the elementary level. If school mitigation measures are strictly followed, the risk of spread in the schools should still be low, the guidance suggests.
The document suggests that when things get risky, elementary schools can go hybrid, providing in-person instruction at least on some days, but that middle and high schools might go virtual.
Biden has been caught between competing interests as he works to get students in the classroom without spurning the powerful teachers unions that helped get him elected. Critics say he has bowed to unions instead of taking more aggressive action on reopening.
Unlike former President Donald Trump, who pressured schools to open and blasted the CDC for issuing guidance that he said was impractical, Biden has kept his distance from the CDC as it works on recommendations. Even after the CDC's director recently said that vaccinations are not a prerequisite for reopening, the White House declined to take a firm stance on the question.
Getting students back in the classroom is seen as a key to getting parents back to work. As part of Biden's coronavirus relief package, he's calling for $130 billion to help schools update buildings, buy protective gear and enact other recommended safety measures.
Biden's national strategy says the administration ""will also work with states and local school districts to support screening testing in schools, including working with states to ensure an adequate supply of test kits.""
But the CDC guidance stops short of recommending testing, saying ""Some schools may also elect to use screening testing as a strategy to identify cases and prevent secondary transmission.""
Existing CDC guidelines encourage a variety of measures to fight COVID-19 in schools, including the use of masks in certain settings, along with social distancing, hand washing and regular cleaning.
Some education leaders, however, said that CDC guidance provided under Trump did not go far enough and that information issued to schools was inconsistent. On masks, for example, it says face coverings are recommended if students cannot be spaced 6 feet apart, but with social distancing, it says masks ""may be considered.""
In the early days of the U.S. epidemic, some health experts worried that schools might become cauldrons of coronavirus infection, with kids infecting each other and then spreading it to family members — as seems to be the case during cold and flu season.
Those concerns were stoked by reports of an explosive outbreak in May at a high school in Israel, shortly after schools in that country reopened after a lockdown.
But with the economy reeling after lockdowns of schools and businesses last spring, the Trump administration pushed hard for schools to reopen.
In July, Trump accused the CDC of ""asking schools to do very impractical things"" in order to reopen. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos incorrectly said research showed there is no danger ""in any way"" if kids are in school, and Vice President Mike Pence promised that the CDC would issue new guidance.
The CDC did post revised documents late that month that kept many of its earlier recommendations. But in response to reporters' questions, CDC officials said that the decision on whether to send kids back to school really rested with parents. The agency also posted an introductory document — written by government officials outside the CDC — that stressed the potential risks of children not attending school.

SALT LAKE CITY — Washington, D.C., extended two olive branches to the Navajo Nation Tuesday, with President Joe Biden signing a major disaster declaration to help with the reservation's COVID-19 response and Sens. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., introducing legislation aimed at expanding access to drinking water on tribal nations around the country.
The disaster declaration will free up federal resources and reimburse emergency funds used to fight COVID-19, a move that Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez called ""a great step forward"" toward curbing a virus that has claimed 1,032 lives on the reservation as of Tuesday.
The declaration will support the Navajo Nation's vaccine distribution, medical staffing and requests for resources and equipment.
""Our administration has advocated for the declaration for quite some time, so we are very appreciative of the quick response from the Biden-Harris administration,"" Nez said in a statement Tuesday, noting that he and Navajo Nation Vice President Myron Lizer met with White House officials Sunday to ask for additional COVID-19 vaccines and reaffirm their request for the declaration.
""We are very pleased with today's announcement,"" said Lizer. ""We have many of our Navajo people who are struggling not only with resources, but with the toll that the pandemic has taken on their mental and spiritual health.""
Meanwhile the bipartisan legislation rolled out by Romney and Sinema Tuesday would funnel $1.3 billion toward the Sanitation Facilities Construction Program in an effort to support water and sanitation projects for the country's tribal communities.
Navajo Nation has some of the highest #COVID19 infection rates in the country—due largely to a lack of infrastructure. Our bill addresses this issue by authorizing the construction & renovation of water & sewer sanitation facilities in Native communities. https://t.co/usTMQy4TUH
— Senator Mitt Romney (@SenatorRomney) February 3, 2021
Roughly 30 percent of residents on the Navajo Nation lack access to running water and adequate sanitation, a reality that experts say is behind the reservation's high per-capita rate of coronavirus infections.
""With some of the highest COVID-19 infection rates in the country, the Navajo Nation faces a dire situation — due in large part to a lack of water infrastructure and sanitation facilities,"" Romney said in a press release. ""Our legislation will address this issue head on by authorizing the construction and renovation of water and sewer sanitation facilities in Native (American) communities in Utah and throughout the country.""
The proposed legislation seeks to build on the Navajo Utah Water Rights Settlement Act, which unanimously passed the Senate in June and ""settles a decadeslong negotiation among the Navajo Nation, federal government, and the state of Utah over water rights for Utah Navajos,"" according to Romney's office.
The bill gives the Navajo Nation rights to 81,500 acre-feet of water each year from its Colorado River Basin apportionment, authorizes $210 million in funding for water infrastructure on Utah's side of the reservation and requires the Beehive State to contribute $8 million towards the settlement.
The bill was included in a $2.3 trillion omnibus appropriations package signed by former President Donald Trump in December.
On March 11, days before its first confirmed case of COVID-19, the Navajo Nation declared a public health state of emergency that still remains in effect today.",2021-02-03T00:00:00Z,2021,1,21

WASHINGTON (Reuters) — The United States faces a dark milestone this week despite a recent decline in COVID-19 cases as it prepares to mark a staggering half-million deaths, with President Joe Biden planning to memorialize the lives lost.
While the number of COVID-19 cases fell for the fifth straight week and officials scrambled to inoculate the population, the nation was poised to reach 500,000 deaths from the highly infectious respiratory disease.
It has been nearly a year since the pandemic upended the country with dueling public health and economic crises.
""It's nothing like we've ever been through in the last 102 years since the 1918 influenza pandemic. ... It really is a terrible situation that we've been through — and that we're still going through,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, White House COVID-19 medical adviser and the nation's top infectious disease official, told CNN's ""State of the Union"" program on Sunday.
The White House said on Sunday it planned a memorial event in which Biden would deliver remarks.
A White House spokesman said the president along with first lady Jill Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff would hold a moment of silence on Monday and there would be a candle-lighting ceremony at sundown.
Biden last month observed America's 400,000 COVID-19 deaths on the eve of his inauguration with a sundown ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial's Reflecting Pool.
Biden will use ""his own voice and platform to take a moment to remember the people whose lives have been lost, the families who are still suffering ... at what is still a very difficult moment in this country,"" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters on Friday.
It's nothing like we've ever been through in the last 102 years since the 1918 influenza pandemic. ... It really is a terrible situation that we've been through — and that we're still going through.
–Dr. Anthony Fauci
Still at a 'very high' level
More than 28 million COVID-19 cases have rocked the United States and 497,862 have died, even as daily average deaths and hospitalizations have fallen to the lowest levels since before the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. The virus took a full year off the average life expectancy in the United States, the biggest decline since World War Two.
While the decline ""is really terrific ... we are still at a level that's very high,"" Fauci said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" program. ""We want to get that baseline really, really, really low before we start thinking that we're out of the woods.""
Fauci told CNN that Americans may still need masks in 2022 even as other measures to stop the virus' spread become increasingly relaxed and more vaccines are administered, and they may also need a booster shot depending on how variants emerge.
Less than 15% of the U.S. population has received at least one vaccine dose, with nearly 43 million getting at least one shot and nearly 18 million getting a second shot, U.S. statistics show.
More localities are easing some restrictions, such as on indoor dining, and moving to reopen schools even as millions await their shots, sparking debate over the safety of teachers, students and others.
Financial pressures also continue to weigh even as economists express optimism for the year ahead. Congress is weighing Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, with the House of Representatives expected to vote on it this week and the Senate seeking to pass it before March 14.

RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — The global death toll from the coronavirus topped 3 million people Saturday amid repeated setbacks in the worldwide vaccination campaign and a deepening crisis in places such as Brazil, India and France.
The number of lives lost, as compiled by Johns Hopkins University, is about equal to the population of Kyiv, Ukraine; Caracas, Venezuela; or metropolitan Lisbon, Portugal. It is bigger than Chicago (2.7 million) and equivalent to Philadelphia and Dallas combined.
And the true number is believed to be significantly higher because of possible government concealment and the many cases overlooked in the early stages of the outbreak that began in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019.
When the world back in January passed the bleak threshold of 2 million deaths, immunization drives had just started in Europe and the United States. Today, they are underway in more than 190 countries, though progress in bringing the virus under control varies widely.
While the campaigns in the U.S. and Britain have hit their stride and people and businesses there are beginning to contemplate life after the pandemic, other places, mostly poorer countries but some rich ones as well, are lagging behind in putting shots in arms and have imposed new lockdowns and other restrictions as virus cases soar.
Worldwide, deaths are on the rise again, running at around 12,000 per day on average, and new cases are climbing too, eclipsing 700,000 a day.
""This is not the situation we want to be in 16 months into a pandemic, where we have proven control measures,"" said Maria Van Kerkhove, one of the World Health Organization's leaders on COVID-19.
This is not the situation we want to be in 16 months into a pandemic, where we have proven control measures.
–Maria Van Kerkhove, World Health Organization
In Brazil, where deaths are running at about 3,000 per day, accounting for one-quarter of the lives lost worldwide in recent weeks, the crisis has been likened to a ""raging inferno"" by one WHO official. A more contagious variant of the virus has been rampaging across the country.
The slow vaccine rollout has crushed Brazilians' pride in their own history of carrying out huge immunization campaigns that were the envy of the developing world.
Taking cues from President Jair Bolsonaro, who has likened the virus to little more than a flu, his Health Ministry for months bet big on a single vaccine, ignoring other producers. When bottlenecks emerged, it was too late to get large quantities in time.
Watching so many patients suffer and die alone at her Rio de Janeiro hospital impelled nurse Lidiane Melo to take desperate measures.
In the early days of the pandemic, as sufferers were calling out for comfort that she was too busy to provide, Melo filled two rubber gloves with warm water, knotted them shut, and sandwiched them around a patient's hand to simulate a loving touch.
Some have christened the practice the ""hand of God,"" and it is now the searing image of a nation roiled by a medical emergency with no end in sight.
""Patients can't receive visitors. Sadly, there's no way. So it's a way to provide psychological support, to be there together with the patient holding their hand,"" Melo said. She added: ""And this year it's worse, the seriousness of patients is 1,000 times greater.""
This situation is similarly dire in India, where cases spiked in February after weeks of steady decline, taking authorities by surprise. In a surge driven by variants of the virus, India saw over 180,000 new infections in one 24-hour span during the past week, bringing the total number of cases to over 13.9 million.
Problems that India had overcome last year are coming back to haunt health officials. Only 178 ventilators were free Wednesday afternoon in New Delhi, a city of 29 million, where 13,000 new infections were reported the previous day.
The challenges facing India reverberate beyond its borders since the country is the biggest supplier of shots to COVAX, the U.N.-sponsored program to distribute vaccines to poorer parts of the world. Last month, India said it would suspend vaccine exports until the virus's spread inside the country slows.
In Utah:
The WHO recently described the supply situation as precarious. Up to 60 countries might not receive any more shots until June, by one estimate. To date, COVAX has delivered about 40 million doses to more than 100 countries, enough to cover barely 0.25% of the world's population.
Globally, about 87% of the 700 million doses dispensed have been given out in rich countries. While 1 in 4 people in wealthy nations have received a vaccine, in poor countries the figure is 1 in more than 500.
In recent days, the U.S. and some European countries put the use of Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine on hold while authorities investigate extremely rare but dangerous blood clots. AstraZeneca's vaccine has likewise been hit with delays and restrictions because of a clotting scare.
Another concern: Poorer countries are relying on vaccines made by China and Russia, which some scientists believe provide less protection than those made by Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca.
Last week, the director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention acknowledged the country's vaccines offer low protection and said officials are considering mixing them with other shots to improve their effectiveness.
In the U.S.
In the U.S., where over 560,000 lives have been lost, accounting for more than 1 in 6 of the world's COVID-19 deaths, hospitalizations and deaths have dropped, businesses are reopening, and life is beginning to return to something approaching normalcy in several states. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits tumbled last week to 576,000, a post-COVID-19 low.
But progress has been patchy, and new hot spots — most notably Michigan — have flared up in recent weeks. Still, deaths in the U.S. are down to about 700 per day on average, plummeting from a mid-January peak of about 3,400.
In Europe, countries are feeling the brunt of a more contagious variant that first ravaged Britain and has pushed the continent's COVID-19-related death toll beyond 1 million.
Close to 6,000 gravely ill patients are being treated in French critical care units, numbers not seen since the first wave a year ago.
Dr. Marc Leone, head of intensive care at the North Hospital in Marseille, said exhausted front-line staff members who were feted as heroes at the start of the pandemic now feel alone and are clinging to hope that renewed school closings and other restrictions will help curb the virus in the coming weeks.
""There's exhaustion, more bad tempers. You have to tread carefully because there are a lot of conflicts,"" he said. ""We'll give everything we have to get through these 15 days as best we can.""
Goodman reported from Miami and Cheng reported from London. AP Writers John Leicester in Paris and Aniruddha Ghosal in New Delhi contributed to this report.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The southeastern United States will be the first to see price rises at the pumps due to the supply disruption caused by the shutdown of the country's top fuel pipeline network - and demand has already picked up as drivers fill their tanks, industry experts said on Sunday.
The attack forced Colonial Pipeline to shut down its entire system on Friday. Some smaller lines were restarted Sunday, but Colonial has given no timeline for the restart of its main pipelines.
The network ships more than 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from the Gulf Coast to populous southeast and northeast states.
Florida, Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Tennessee rely on the line for most of their fuel supplies and suffered localized shortages and higher prices during previous shutdowns.
Demand in some states served by the pipeline - including Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Tennessee - rose about 4.3% on Saturday compared to a week earlier, said Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at fuel tracking firm GasBuddy.
Demand is picking up across the United States as more people are vaccinated against COVID-19 and begin to travel more. The peak demand summer driving season begins at the end of May.
DeHaan said drivers should avoid panic buying.
""Rushing out and filling your tank will make the problem much much more acute and likely double or triple the length of any supply event, if it comes to that,"" he said.
Florida is the third biggest gasoline consuming state in the United States in 2019 and Georgia was the sixth, according to latest U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data.
Gas prices have risen a cent on the gallon since Friday, said the American Automobile Association. The average price stood at $2.962 for regular unleaded gasoline compared with $2.901 a week earlier, the AAA said.
""If the interruption persists, we will see more regional impacts than nation-wide, in terms of supply and prices. The south/southeast (Maryland to Mississippi to Georgia), will likely see gas prices increase first,"" the AAA said in a statement to Reuters.
""The shorter the pipeline shutdown, the better news for motorists.""
There will likely be price increases at fuel distribution points at several locations, said Ernie Barsamian, chief executive officer of The Tank Tiger, a U.S. terminal storage clearinghouse. Those distribution centers are particularly in Wilmington in North Carolina, Charleston in South Carolina and Savannah in Georgia, he said.
Most of the terminals along Colonial Pipeline's route should have at least 10 days of supply, but since prices to sell now are higher than those for later, companies have not been incentivized to store fuel and some terminals could be running leaner, Barsamian added.
JET FUEL
Airlines in the region would also be vulnerable to a prolonged outage, said Tom Kloza, founder of the Oil Price Information Service.
""Perhaps the biggest concern might be jet fuel,"" he said. ""... airports tend to really test the boundaries of just-in-time inventory practices.""
Airports served by Colonial include some of the busiest in the country - including Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, one of the busiest in the world by passenger traffic, and Charlotte Douglas International Airport.
The Colonial shutdown has not affected operations at Hartsfield-Jackson airport and its airlines are in close communications with fuel suppliers and are confident the incident will be reconciled before there is an operational impact, a spokesman for the airport told Reuters.
Fuel suppliers will need to seek to transport stopgap supplies through other pipelines, but none of them have the capacity to compensate for Colonial's shutdown. Suppliers may also use barges and trucks, but those are more expensive.
Suppliers started booking space on a smaller pipeline that serves some of those states as soon as the Colonial Pipeline shut down on Friday, market participants said.
The Plantation Pipeline is working with customers to take on more volume, said Melissa Ruiz, a spokeswoman for Kinder Morgan, which operates the line.
The pipeline can only carry a fraction of the fuel that would have gone through the Colonial Pipeline. Plantation has capacity to carry 720,000 bpd and its mainlines are fully subscribed and frozen for the month of May, Ruiz said, adding that the company is deferring any non-essential maintenance to keep the line flowing.
Colonial supplies about 45% of all fuel consumed on the East Coast, providing refined products to more than 50 million Americans.
Dependency on the pipeline has grown in recent years as old refineries on the U.S. East coast have shut down.
The region around New York is less vulnerable to disruptions than the southeast as it can receive fuel imports from Europe and elsewhere.

SALT LAKE CITY — Walking around downtown Salt Lake City without a face mask now that new federal guidelines say they're no longer needed in most situations for Americans who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 ""feels like coming back to life,"" retired library supervisor Sharee Birrell said Friday.
Birrell said she and her husband, Andrew, a retired physician assistant, have carefully followed the advice of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention even after Utah lifted its statewide mask mandate on April 10, but were ready to set aside the face coverings.
""I feel totally comfortable not wearing the mask. We protected ourselves during the time we needed to. The only people we could protect is ourselves,"" Sharee Birrell said. ""Ever since we got vaccinated, my husband has said, 'We're vaccinated, why should we wear masks?' It's time.""
The West Valley City couple did have masks on during their TRAX ride downtown, she said, since face coverings are still required on public transportation, including planes, buses and trains. And they'll continue to put them on when asked to do so in stores or other places.
But on Friday, the couple were maskless as they headed for their weekly hike in City Creek Canyon.
""It was kind of nice, I have to admit, after about 14 months,"" Sharee Birrell said.
The new guidelines issued Thursday say fully vaccinated Americans ""can resume activities that you did prior to the pandemic,"" including indoors, without wearing a mask or social distancing unless federal, state or local authorities, or private businesses, say otherwise.
A law passed earlier this year by the Utah Legislature ended not only the statewide mask mandate last month but more recently other COVID-19 related restrictions, except for the mask requirement in K-12 schools. Gov. Spencer Cox announced Thursday that will end early, in the final days of the school year.
Some government entities and businesses kept a mask mandate in place beyond April, and in addition to public transportation around the country, masks will still have to be worn by everyone, vaccinated or not, in health care facilities and congregant settings such as prisons and homeless shelters.
Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall has amended her executive order requiring masks to be worn in city facilities to exclude those who are fully vaccinated, although city employees will be encouraged to wear masks when social distancing is not possible.
In Salt Lake County, Mayor Jenny Wilson also said the fully vaccinated won't need masks in county facilities but pointed out in a message to county employees that ""wearing them continues to offer health benefits"" and that they ""should respect the decisions of others regarding face coverings.""
State employees were told earlier this week the mask mandate in state government facilities ends Saturday.
It takes two weeks after receiving the final dose of a vaccine to be considered fully vaccinated, and two of the three vaccines approved for use in the United States require two doses up to 28 days apart. In Utah, just over 34% of the entire population is fully vaccinated, and 42.3% of those eligible for the shots, now anyone 12 and older.
The new CDC guidelines are widely seen as a way to boost those numbers.
""The guidelines are an incentive to get vaccinated. The benefits of vaccination include significantly more opportunities to enjoy activities in a much more normal way than we've been able to in a long time,"" said Dr. Brandon Webb, an Intermountain Healthcare infectious diseases physician.
Still, Webb said there are circumstances where even someone who is fully vaccinated may still want to mask up. Someone who is overweight or has a medical condition like diabetes may not be as protected by the vaccine, he said, so that person, as well as those around them, may want the ""extra layer of precaution"" a mask provides.
The same may be true in large indoor gatherings where some people may not be fully vaccinated, Webb said.
He said the CDC's shift is not based on new scientific findings about the virus but on what's seen as a need to move toward personal responsibility for dealing with its risks while at the same time offering ""some clear reward"" so more people will get the shots.
""That does come with some degree of compromise or concession with respect to the full benefits of everyone wearing masks in all situations. Because that level of extreme caution, I think, is off-putting to many who are on the fence about vaccination. And vaccination still remains our singular tool for returning to full normal,"" Webb said.
The doctor said he'll follow the new guidelines himself, calling them positive.
""I don't plan to be more conservative than the CDC because I think it's important to also set the tone that as a society, we are dipping our toes into new water, so to speak, right now. And we're going to have to figure out how to make this transition work,"" he said.

Dr. Thomas Miller, University of Utah Health chief medical officer, said not everyone will be ready to give up their masks.
""There are a number of people who may at this point feel more secure even though they're vaccinated, and they're shopping or inside, wearing a mask. And that's OK. That's not a problem. There may be some concern about public shaming, perhaps, but if people feel more comfortable even if vaccinated wearing a mask, that's up to them,"" he said.
What is more important is showcasing the pluses of vaccination, Miller said, although the public won't know whether someone who is not wearing a mask has actually gotten the shots or not.
""It's based on trust, It's based on freedom of choice, and I think that's how it's going to have to be. I think the CDC is trying to say, 'If you are vaccinated you will be safe without wearing a mask,'"" he said, sending a message to those who aren't vaccinated that they aren't fully protected and should wear a mask.
""We're basing this on the public's willingness to do the right thing. We're appealing to the individual's sense of social duty to protect those around us, to pay attention and say, 'If I'm not vaccinated I should still wear a mask until I get vaccinated,'"" Miller said.
He said the new guidance is ""a big relief"" and a sign things are slowly getting better.
""If you're vaccinated and the news now is there's, for the most part, a very high likelihood you're fine, you're safe, you're not going to get infected and if you do, it's going to be a mild infection, most people accept that risk, want to take that risk and are happy to drop the mask,"" Miller said.
Susan Holding-Rosetta, of Midvale, said she's not ready to give up her mask even though she's been fully vaccinated for several months.
""I'm so hip on wearing a mask, and I have masks with sequins,"" the 72-year-old said after shopping at a grocery store and getting her hair done. ""I feel a little bit more secure, for the percentage of people in Utah who haven't gotten the vaccine. I just feel like for me, I want to be pretty safe and I think it's just kind of a habit now to wear it.""
She said she's aware of the new guidelines but ""wants to give it a little more time. Maybe September.""",2021-05-14T00:00:00Z,2021,2,22

SALT LAKE CITY — The COVID-19 vaccination rates in Utah look different based on the county. And this week, more high schools around the Wasatch Front are offering clinics for ages 16 and up to get a COVID-19 vaccine. It adds to the numbers of Utah's biggest still unvaccinated age group.
The majority of Utahns over age 70 are fully vaccinated, but they've been eligible longer. Utahns ages 16 to 49 have been eligible for the last month. Almost 880,000 Utahns are fully vaccinated. That's 37% of the eligible population 16 and up.
But it varies by the local health department. In some areas of Utah, counties report percentages of people fully vaccinated in the low to mid-20s, out of their total populations.
The Tri-County Health Department (covering Uintah, Duchesne and Daggett counties) reports 19.6% fully vaccinated, while Summit County reports vaccination rates more than double that at 43%.
This could be because there are a lot of kids in certain areas who are not eligible and bring the percentage down. Or there are fewer appointments or farther to drive. Or some hesitancy to get the shot, especially in places where COVID-19 transmission is low.
A breakdown of COVID-19 vaccine numbers by health department
Below are the percent vaccinated in each health department, from lowest to highest, as of Tuesday morning, according to the vaccination map on coronavirus.utah.gov:
- Tri-County: 19.6%
- Tooele County: 21.4%
- Utah County: 21.5%
- Central Utah: 21.6%
- Bear River: 25.1%
- Weber-Morgan: 26%
- Southwest Utah: 26.8%
- Davis County: 27.2%
- Southeast Utah: 26.7%
- Wasatch County: 27.3%
- Salt Lake County: 29.1%
- San Juan: 32.1%
- Summit County: 43%

Vaccine data by city
The state's vaccine data lets you drill down into even smaller areas on that same page. And differences show up there.
For example, 45.57% of Park City's total population is fully vaccinated, Bountiful is at 32.8%, and Farmington 30.78% as of Tuesday.
The city of Sandy is at 36.66%, Draper is at 31.89%, and Riverton/Bluffdale sits at 27.1%.
On the west side of Salt Lake City, 22.15% of the Rose Park area is vaccinated. But, the Foothill/East Bench numbers in Salt Lake City are much higher at 44.56%.
In Utah County, Alpine is 27.59%, Pleasant Grove/Lindon is 23.61%, Lehi is 20.66%, and Saratoga Springs 19.3%.
One possible reason for the differing vaccination rates is because Saratoga Springs has more children than Park City. Additionally, Farmington has a mass drive-through location making it easier for residents to receive their shots.
School district vaccine clinics
In an effort to vaccinate teens, school districts throughout the state are hosting vaccine clinics to boost vaccination rates. The Salt Lake City and Canyons School District are the latest school districts to join the cause.
Students 16 and older enrolled in either district are able to receive their COVID-19 vaccine through one of the clinics set up by the schools.

Connecticut will no longer allow a religious exemption from childhood immunization requirements for schools, colleges and day care facilities, becoming the sixth state to end that policy.
The legislation was signed into law Wednesday by Gov. Ned Lamont, hours after the Democratic-controlled Senate passed the bill late Tuesday night. More than 2,000 opponents had rallied outside the state Capitol building, arguing the legislation unfairly infringes on their religious liberties and parental rights.
""Proud to sign this bill into law to protect as many of our school children as possible from infectious diseases as we can,"" Lamont said in a tweet, announcing he had signed the contentious bill.
Shortly afterward, two groups opposing the legislation — We The Patriots USA, Inc. and The CT Freedom Alliance, LLC. — said they plan to file state and federal lawsuits seeking to overturn the new law, which will take effect with the 2022-23 school year.
""The notion that somehow the state government gets the right to cram its version of virtue down the throats of every citizen in this state is and ought to be offensive to every Connecticut resident,"" said Norm Pattis, an attorney representing the organizations. He called it ""far more chilling"" to tell a parent how to raise their child than to expose other children to a ""nominal risk"" of infection, given the state's high, overall vaccination rate.
The other states without religious exemptions for vaccines are California, New York, West Virginia, Mississippi and Maine, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Under Connecticut's new law, which applies to public and private schools, higher education, day care and child care centers, any students in kindergarten and older with an existing religious exemption will be grandfathered. Also, the state's medical exemption will remain in place.
Proponents have argued that eliminating the exemption will help prevent potential outbreaks of illnesses like measles. They cited a slow and steady increase in the number of religious exemptions for childhood vaccinations and declining vaccination rates in some particular schools.
""The exemption has been used in recent years to skirt the vaccine law, causing many schools to fall below the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's threshold of 95% needed for herd immunity against highly contagious diseases like Measles, Pertussis, Tetanus, and Meningitis, among others,"" the Vaccination Alliance of Connecticut, a coalition of public health officials, parents and others, said in a written statement.
Vaccines are encouraged, or in this case required, because they have been proven safe and protect not only those vaccinated but also others who can't be by slowing the spread of preventable diseases.
But critics, which include both parents with fears about vaccine safety and religious liberty advocates, argue the bill is unnecessary given the state's overall high vaccination rate and discriminatory, forcing parents with religious concerns about vaccines to ultimately home-school their children.
""Don't ever consider yourself a champion of children. You failed our kids by voting yes on #HB6423. You are denying services to special needs kids. You are forcing families out of the workforce,"" The CT Freedom Alliance tweeted at Lamont and state legislators who voted for the bill, also calling Lamont a ""tyrant.""
Lamont said he spent a lot of time researching the issue.
""When it comes to the safety of our children, we need to take an abundance of caution,"" he said in a statement. ""This legislation is needed to protect our kids against serious illnesses that have been well-controlled for many decades, such as measles, tuberculosis, and whooping cough, but have reemerged.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) — Moderna on Tuesday filed for full U.S. approval of its COVID-19 vaccine, which is currently only authorized for emergency use in the country, becoming the second drugmaker to seek a broader regulatory nod.
The development comes weeks after rival Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech SE sought full approval for their COVID-19 vaccine in the United States.
Full approval for the vaccines, which are at the forefront of global immunization efforts, could be an important step in allaying vaccine hesitancy, a growing concern in the United States and other wealthy nations.
It would also allow the vaccine makers to market their shots directly, as well as help companies and government agencies looking for vaccinations for their employees.
Moderna said it will continue to submit data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on a rolling basis over the coming weeks with a request for a priority review.
On completion of the submission, the FDA will notify the company when it is formally accepted for review, it added.
Moderna has an agreement with the U.S. government to supply 300 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine.
More than 151 million doses of Moderna's vaccine have been distributed around the United States, with roughly 124.5 million shots administered as of Monday, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Under an emergency use authorization, the FDA makes a product available to the public during an emergency based on the best available evidence, without waiting for all the evidence needed for full approval or clearance.
Moderna said in April its vaccine showed strong protection against the coronavirus six months after people received their second shot, with efficacy of more than 90% against all cases of COVID-19 and more than 95 percent against severe COVID-19.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) —The Biden administration said on Friday it is extending face mask requirements across all U.S. transportation networks through Sept. 13 to address the spread of COVID-19.
The U.S. Transportation Security Administration requirements that took effect on Feb. 1 were to set to expire on May 11. They cover workers and travelers at airports, on board commercial aircraft, on over-the-road buses, and on commuter bus and rail systems through Sept. 13.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued the federal mask mandate in nearly all transportation modes in late January, including on ride-share vehicles. The order does not apply to private cars or commercial trucks being driven by a sole operator.
The decision was praised by airlines and airline unions.
Airlines for America, a trade group representing major airlines, hailed ""the administration's decision to extend the mandate requiring face coverings onboard commercial aircraft and in airports.""
The group said ""this layer of protection plays a critical role in mitigating the risk of transmission ... (and) has significantly strengthened our flight crews' ability to enforce these requirements onboard.""
The CDC said Wednesday it relaxed its guidelines to say fully vaccinated people could safely engage in outdoor activities such as walking and hiking without wearing masks. It said they should continue to use face-coverings in public spaces where they are required.
Related:
The TSA federal mandate requires masks in transit even in states where officials have relaxed requirements in other public places such as restaurants.
Wearing face masks is considered by experts one of the most effective ways of controlling virus transmission. With most COVID-19 transmission occurring indoors, and vaccinations on the rise, the use of masks outdoors has been debated for weeks in the United States as many Americans look to enjoy the benefits of being fully vaccinated.
Biden imposed the transit mask mandate after then President Donald Trump rejected CDC recommendations to do so.
The TSA told Reuters that since the transit mask requirements took effect on Feb. 1 its agents have ""largely experienced voluntary compliance.""
It said ""transportation system operators have reported almost 2,000 passengers for refusing to wear a face mask. TSA will assess a civil penalty if necessary.""
In March, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration indefinitely extended a ""zero tolerance policy"" on unruly air passengers first imposed in January, after hundreds of reported incidents.
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson extended the policy set to expire March 30, ""as we continue to do everything we can to confront the pandemic."" The FAA said the extension will last at least as long as the federal transportation face mask order remains in effect.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) — U.S. Senator Mitt Romney called on Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday to act with more urgency to distribute COVID-19 vaccines to countries in desperate need, noting that international rivals Russia and China have been acting more quickly to send their vaccines abroad.
Romney, an influential moderate Republican voice in the deeply divided Senate, said he was ""dismayed to learn"" that China and Russia are pushing out their vaccines, while the United States has not been communicating in detail when needy countries can expect doses.
""While the U.S. continues to 'plan' and 'prioritize' vaccine distribution, China is using its weight and its own, far less efficacious, vaccine to push countries needing vaccines to follow China's political goals,"" Romney wrote in a letter to Blinken seen by Reuters.
He said China could use vaccine diplomacy, for example, to forge closer ties with countries in Latin America, such as Honduras, whose foreign minister recently said the country wanted to avoid breaking long-standing ties with Taiwan, but access to vaccines was more urgent than anything else.
""I respectfully urge you to immediately enter discussions with countries around the world and implement a strategy for vaccine distribution to those countries. Upon doing so, I urge you to announce and publish timelines for vaccine distribution by country,"" Romney wrote.
As the world grapples with the coronavirus pandemic, poorer countries that make up half the world's population have received just 17% of doses, a situation the World Health Organization head has labeled ""vaccine apartheid.""
Developed nations have been debating how to handle the situation, including arguing over whether intellectual property rights should be waived for the vaccines to help boost international production.

SALT LAKE CITY — The state of Utah won't require masks in K-12 schools for the last week of the school year, Gov. Spencer Cox announced Thursday.
Individual school districts will have the option to continue mask mandates in their schools to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, but the state will lift its blanket mask requirement for all districts in the state, the governor said. Starting on the Monday of whenever districts have their last weeks of school, masks won't be required, he said.
The motivation for lifting the mandate in the last week of school is to give students a chance to see their teachers and friends at schools that last week, the governor said.
""So give kids an opportunity to see their teachers, to see their friends, to spend that last week together without masks, if they so choose,"" Cox said during the state's weekly COVID-19 news conference Thursday.
The governor said there had been a request from several districts for the state to lift the school mask mandate, but Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson later clarified that there was no single district that pushed the decision over the finish line.
Families and kids can still make the decision to continue wearing masks, and Cox pleaded with people to respect the choices of individual parents and students.
""We believe that this is the right thing to do, we believe that this is the prudent thing to do, but I will say that masks are still encouraged, and families and children will be able to make those decisions,"" he said. ""I would ask that parents and students and teachers, that everyone be respectful of the choices that are made by those families for that last week.""
Utah Department of Health deputy director Dr. Michelle Hofmann, who is a pediatrician, said she still recommends that kids wear masks in schools. Until more people are vaccinated, masks are still a very effective tool in preventing the spread of COVID-19, she said.
However, she encouraged parents to have discussions with their children about masks and determine their comfort levels.
""We have to be able to have these conversations at an individual level, and assess risks as parents of children and do the right thing,"" Hofmann said during the news conference. ""Let's let our children witness that we can all do this together. Let's not use them as instruments either.""
For the majority of the pandemic, Utah's COVID-19 response has been handled by a unified command team featuring state employees from various agencies, including the Utah Department of Health and Utah Department of Public Safety.
Starting Monday, the state will transition back to a COVID-19 response team under the sole direction of health department Executive Director Rich Saunders, according to Henderson. This will allow state employees outside the health department who were devoting time to the unified command group to focus on their regular jobs, she said.
The state's weekly COVID-19 news conferences, which typically take place on Thursdays, will continue to be held weekly until the end of May, Henderson said. After that point, the pace of the briefings will likely slow down. The health department's coronavirus data dashboard, found at coronavirus.utah.gov/case-counts, will continue to be updated, and the state's COVID-19-related social media accounts also will remain active after the end of May, she added.
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox provided a COVID-19 pandemic update at a news conference Thursday morning. Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson and Utah Department of Health Deputy Director Dr. Michelle Hofmann also spoke at the event. Watch the replay below.
Utah hoping to see bump in vaccinations
Just over a third of Utah's total population is now fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and this week's decision from federal regulators to authorize the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for the 12-15 age group should bump that percentage in the coming weeks.
But state officials aren't happy with the current vaccination pace.
""We need to do better, we need to do a lot better,"" Henderson said Thursday.
Utah is continuing to shift its vaccination strategy toward one where the state comes to you, rather than you coming to the state to be vaccinated. Individual organizations are now able to schedule their own vaccination clinics in businesses, churches, workplaces and other settings, and most vaccination clinics in the state now allow walk-ins instead of requiring appointments.
The latest effort to improve vaccine equity and get more shots in arms is ride-sharing companies offering free rides to vaccination appointments. Uber and Lyft will soon both offer free rides to appointments through their app, Henderson said. The feature is expected to roll out within the next few weeks and will be available until July 4.
Since the Pfizer vaccine is now available for adolescents in the 12-15 age group, officials are encouraging parents to make decisions with their children and with their primary care providers about getting vaccinated, Hofmann said.
""They're having those crucial conversations and we're getting more Utahns vaccinated,"" she said.
Intermountain Healthcare announced on Thursday evening that it's now offering COVID-19 vaccination appointments for individuals 12 and older throughout Utah starting Saturday.
Appointments can be made at Intermountain Logan Regional Hospital, Intermountain McKay-Dee Hospital in Ogden, Intermountain Riverton Hospital, Intermountain Utah Valley Hospital in Provo, and Intermountain St. George Regional Hospital. Parents or guardians can schedule an appointment for the child at Intermountain.com/covidvaccine. Walk-ins are welcome.
More information about where to find a vaccination site for children ages 12-15 is available at coronavirus.utah.gov. At least 117 primary care providers in Utah are now offering vaccinations directly from their offices, according to Hofmann.
New COVID-19 cases
Utah's number of COVID-19 cases increased by 418 on Thursday, with six more deaths and 14,578 vaccinations reported, according to the Utah Department of Health.
There are an estimated 7,630 active cases of COVID-19 in Utah, according to the health department. The rolling seven-day average number of positive cases per day is now at 328, according to the health department. The positive test rate per day for that time period calculated with the ""people over people"" method is now 6.7%. The positive test rate per day for that time period calculated with the ""test over test"" method is now 3.6%.
There are 152 COVID-19 patients currently hospitalized in Utah, including 53 in intensive care, state data shows. About 73% of intensive care unit beds in Utah hospitals are now occupied, including 74% of ICU beds in the state's 16 referral hospitals. About 56% of non-ICU hospital beds are now occupied in Utah, according to the health department.
A total of 2,355,333 vaccine doses have been administered in the state, up from 2,340,755 Wednesday. There are now 1,370,701 Utahns who have received at least a first dose of the vaccine, and 1,084,381 are fully vaccinated, according to the health department. A total of 2,851,143 vaccine doses have been shipped to the state so far.
State data now shows that 42.8% of Utah's total population has received at least a first dose of the vaccine, and 33.8% are fully vaccinated. Among Utahns age 16 and older, 57.6% have received at least one dose and 45.6% are fully vaccinated, according to the health department.
The new numbers indicate a 0.1% increase in positive cases since Wednesday. Of the 2,623,583 people tested for COVID-19 in Utah so far, 15.3% have tested positive for the disease. The number of total tests conducted in Utah since the pandemic began is now 4,781,911, up 14,677 since Wednesday.
The six deaths reported Thursday were:
- Two Iron County men who were between the ages of 65 and 84 and were hospitalized when they died
- A Salt Lake County woman who was over the age of 85 and was a resident of a long-term care facility
- A Salt Lake County man who was between the ages of 45 and 64 and was hospitalized when he died
- A Tooele County woman who was over the age of 85 and was a resident of a long-term care facility
- A Utah County man who was over the age of 85 and was a resident of a long-term care facility
Three of the deaths occurred before April 13 but were still being investigated by state medical examiners, the health department said.
Thursday's totals give Utah 401,669 total confirmed cases, with 16,467 total hospitalizations and 2,255 total deaths from the disease. An estimated 391,784 Utah COVID-19 cases are now considered recovered, according to the health department.

NEW YORK (AP) — The rancorous fight over jail conditions for Ghislaine Maxwell is reaching new lows, with prosecutors blaming the British socialite and Jeffrey Epstein's ex-girlfriend for creating a stink by failing to flush her toilet and her lawyer saying her health is declining in a facility so mucky that even her salad has mold in it.
The latest exchange in letters to a Manhattan federal court judge came this week as the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals scheduled oral arguments for late April on Maxwell's appeal of her thrice-rejected application to be freed on bail before her July 12 sex trafficking trial.
Maxwell has been at a Brooklyn federal jail since her July arrest on charges she recruited three teenage girls for Epstein to sexually abuse in the 1990s. Charges were recently expanded to allege the sex trafficking of girls for Epstein to abuse in the early 2000s. Maxwell has pleaded not guilty.
Attorney Bobbi Sternheim wrote in a letter late Wednesday that an effort by prosecutors ""to publicly embarrass and humiliate Ms. Maxwell in the hostile court of public opinion further erodes the likelihood that her case will be tried by a fair and impartial jury.""
She says Maxwell has been mistreated, including over 1,400 physical searches and flashlight checks to ensure she's breathing every 15 minutes while she sleeps, as jail officials overreact to Epstein's August 2019 self-inflicted death in a Manhattan jail as he awaited trial on sex charges.
The letter came a day after prosecutors got specific about Maxwell's jail conditions as they refuted claims Sternheim made in February that her 59-year-old client was ""withering to a shell of her former self — losing weight, losing hair, and losing her ability to concentrate.""
Sternheim had also alleged that Maxwell was physically abused when she was shoved into her cell by a guard prior to a pat-down search and then was retaliated against for reporting it when she was ordered to clean, sanitize and scrub the walls of a shower.
In their letter, prosecutors said an investigation of the pat-down search complaint proved Maxwell's complaint unfounded.
They wrote that Maxwell was directed to clean her cell, not in retaliation, but because it had become ""very dirty."" They noted that Maxwell ""frequently did not flush her toilet after using it, which caused the cell to smell.""
Prosecutors said jail staff reported Maxwell, fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, to be physically healthy.
They said the jail's medical staff monitor the 5-foot-7 Maxwell daily and weigh her weekly, finding her weight fluctuates between the 130s and the 140s, normal for her height. They said staff has not observed any noticeable hair loss.
In Wednesday's letter, Sternheim criticized the government, calling it ""debatable whether the public has a 'right to know' about Ms. Maxwell's conditions of confinement."" She said prosecutors violated her client's privacy rights by releasing medical information related to weight and vaccination status.
""She is weighed while clothed on scales that are erratic and not set to zero,"" Sternheim said. ""Her eyesight is failing, and her hair is thinning. The guards are far from qualified to assess Ms. Maxwell's physical condition.""
As for Maxwell's toilet, Sternheim said her client avoids using it in a cell closely observed by video and guards but flushes it frequently, as directed by guards, to help alleviate a stench from overflowing toilets in the cellblock above.
""Blaming Ms. Maxwell for the filth of her severely restricted environment is utterly misplaced. To suggest she willingly lives in squalor is absurd,"" the lawyer said.
Sternheim said the building where Maxwell is held is permeated with mold and vermin, and even a salad she was given earlier this week had mold in it.
""Cockroaches and rodents are plentiful and glue tracks have been placed in Ms. Maxwell's day area to help remediate the problem,"" she said.

SALT LAKE CITY — Unless there's a big surge in vaccinations over the next several weeks, it's looking unlikely that Utah will reach Gov. Spencer Cox's goal of seeing 70% of adults in the state have at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine by July 4, the governor said Thursday.
And to emphasize the importance of getting vaccinated, Cox said the vast majority of all new COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths over the past three months are occurring among those who are not vaccinated.
About 64.3% of Utah adults have had at least their first COVID-19 vaccination shots as of Thursday, Cox said during a PBS Utah news conference.
""We're close, we're within shouting distance of 70%,"" he said.
The good news, Cox said, is that Utah's not doing any worse than the national average, which is around 65%. But the bad news is that Utah isn't doing any better, he added.
Cox pointed out that since March 23, when vaccination eligibility opened up to all Utah adults, there have been 28,233 total COVID-19 cases and 1,013 breakthrough cases. That means 96.8% of new confirmed COVID-19 cases have been among unvaccinated people.
About 95% of hospitalizations and 98% of deaths over that time have been among unvaccinated people, the governor added.
""Short story: Vaccines work,"" Cox said.
""They work at the rates we were told they were going to work. They're incredibly successful and we need people to get vaccinated.""
State officials have previously said the 70% goal by the Fourth of July is somewhat arbitrary, and they'll continue pushing the importance of vaccines whether or not the state gets to 70% in that timeframe.
A letter that was sent out to 10,000 businesses this week urging them to support employees who want to get vaccinated with paid time off or other access measures should help boost vaccinations, Cox said.
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox provided a COVID-19 update at a news conference Thursday morning on PBS Utah. Watch the replay of the event below.
369 new COVID-19 cases Thursday
There has been a small increase in COVID-19 cases over the past month in Utah, and case trends have reached another plateau, Cox said. The state had been seeing a rolling average in the low 200s range for new cases per day, but that average is now back up to 270 to 280 new cases a day.
""Nationally, COVID cases are no longer falling,"" he said. ""The good news is that as always, vaccines work to protect us.""
Last week, the TriCounty Health District in eastern Utah said it has experienced a recent COVID-19 outbreak that was attributed to low vaccine rates in that district's jurisdiction of Daggett, Duchesne and Uintah counties. Just 28.5% of people in that health district have received at least one dose of the vaccine — the lowest rate of any Utah health district, according to health data.
Cox said Thursday he had spoken with a hospital manager in Vernal who said all the new cases reported recently have been among unvaccinated people.
The governor said he has also spoken with people who recently lost loved ones to COVID-19, after they refused to get vaccinated against the disease.
""Completely preventable, they didn't have to die,"" Cox said. ""They're dead now because they refused to get vaccinated.""
Utah's number of COVID-19 cases increased by 369 on Thursday, with no new deaths and 6,496 vaccinations reported since Wednesday, according to the Utah Department of Health.
The rolling seven-day average number of positive cases per day is now at 288. The positive test rate per day for that time period calculated with the ""people over people"" method is now 7.6%. The positive test rate per day for that time period calculated with the ""test over test"" method is now 4.9%.
There are now 173 COVID-19 patients currently hospitalized in Utah, including 66 in intensive care units, state data shows. About 80% of ICU beds in Utah are now occupied, including about 83% of ICU beds in the state's 16 referral hospitals, according to the health department. That's above the state's ICU utilization ""warning"" level, indicating that the state's ICUs are more full than health officials would like to see.
About 57% of non-ICU hospital beds are occupied as of Thursday, health data shows.
A total of 2,767,967 vaccine doses have been administered in the state, up from 2,761,471 Wednesday. A total of 1,559,018 Utahns, or about 48.6% of the total state population, have now received at least their first vaccine dose. A total of 1,331,326 Utahns, about 41.5% of the population, is now fully vaccinated, according to the health department.
Among Utahns ages 12 and older, who are currently eligible to receive the vaccine, about 60.1% have at least a first dose and 51.4% are fully vaccinated. State data shows 3,202,528 vaccine doses have been shipped to Utah so far.
Since mid-March, when vaccine eligibility opened up to most Utah adults, there have been 1,013 breakthrough COVID-19 cases, meaning cases that have been confirmed in people who have already been vaccinated, Cox said. Of those, there have been 108 hospitalizations and three deaths, the governor said.
The new numbers indicate a 0.09% increase in positive cases since Wednesday. Of the 2,751,868 people tested for COVID-19 in Utah so far, 14.9% have tested positive for COVID-19. The number of total tests conducted since the pandemic began is now at 5,031,002, which is an increase of 6,724 since Wednesday, according to state data. A total of 3,742 of those were tests of people who had not previously been tested for COVID-19.
Thursday's totals give Utah 410,746 total confirmed cases, with 17,204 total hospitalizations and 2,324 total deaths from the disease.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Powered by consumers and fueled by government aid, the U.S. economy is achieving a remarkably fast recovery from the recession that ripped through the nation last year on the heels of the coronavirus and cost tens of millions of Americans their jobs and businesses.
The economy grew last quarter at a vigorous 6.4% annual rate, the government said Thursday, and expectations are that the current quarter will be even better. The number of people seeking unemployment aid — a rough reflection of layoffs — last week reached its lowest point since the pandemic struck. And the National Association of Realtors said Thursday that more Americans signed contracts to buy homes in March, reflecting a strong housing market as summer approaches.
Economists say that widespread vaccinations and declining viral cases, the reopening of more businesses, a huge infusion of federal aid and healthy job gains should help sustain steady growth. For 2021 as a whole, they expect the economy to expand around 7%, which would mark the fastest calendar-year growth since 1984.
In March, U.S. employers added 916,000 jobs — the biggest burst of hiring since August. Meantime, retail spending has surged, manufacturing output is up and consumer confidence has reached its highest point since the pandemic began.
""We are seeing all the engines of the economy rev up,"" said Gregory Daco, chief economist at Oxford Economics. ""We have an improving health environment, fiscal stimulus remains abundant and we are starting to see rebounding employment.""
The speed of the rebounding economy has been particularly striking given the scope of damage the pandemic inflicted on it beginning in March of last year. With businesses all but shut down, the economy contracted at a record annual pace of 31% in the April-June quarter of last year before rebounding sharply in the subsequent months.
The renewed strength in the United States — the largest economy — is helping lead the developed world out of recession. In Europe, for instance, a recovery has lagged because of smaller government aid and slower vaccination rollouts that have prolonged lockdowns. Economists at Berenberg Bank estimate that the 19 countries that use the euro currency actually contracted in the first quarter.
For all the U.S. economy's gains, it still has a long way to go. More than 8 million jobs remain lost to the pandemic. And the recovery remains sharply uneven: Most college-educated and white-collar employees have been able to work from home over the past year. Many have even built up savings and expanded their wealth from rising home values and a record-setting stock market, which has rocketed more than 80% from March of last year.
By contrast, job cuts have fallen heavily on low-wage workers, racial minorities and people without college educations. In addition, many women, especially working mothers, have had to leave the workforce to care for children.
In its report Thursday, the government said the nation's gross domestic product — its total output of goods and services — accelerated in the January-March quarter from a 4.3% annual gain in the last quarter of 2020.
Some economists say growth in the current April-June period could reach a 10% annual pace or more, driven by a surge in people traveling, shopping, dining out and otherwise resuming their spending habits.
A major reason for the brightening expectations is the record-level federal spending that is poised to flow into the economy. A $1.9 trillion package that President Joe Biden got through Congress in March provided, among other rescue aid, $1,400 stimulus payments to most adults. On top of that, Biden is proposing two additional huge spending plans: a $2.3 trillion infrastructure package and a $1.8 trillion investment in children, families and education that the president promoted Wednesday night in his first address to a joint session of Congress.
The Federal Reserve's ultra-low interest-rate policy, designed to encourage borrowing and spending, has provided significant support, too. In fact, the economy is expected to expand so fast that some economists have raised concerns that it could ignite inflation. In part, this is because rising demand has caused supply bottlenecks and shortages of some components, notably semiconductors, which are critical to the auto, technology and medical device industries, among others.
At a news conference Wednesday, though, Chair Jerome Powell reiterated his confidence that any jump in inflation would prove temporary. And he said the Fed wants to see a substantial and sustained recovery before it would consider withdrawing its economic support. In the meantime, Powell made clear, the central bank isn't even close to beginning a pullback in its ultra-low rate policies.
As more business restrictions are lifted and more people venture out to shop and eat out, companies that serve them are benefiting. McDonald's, for example, posted a sharp jump in revenue last quarter — even surpassing the same period in 2019, long before the pandemic flattened the economy. Likewise, most major tech companies have reported impressive earnings. At Apple, for instance, demand for the iPhone and other company products drove profits to more than double in the January-March period.
In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said he expects to expects the city to ""fully reopen"" by July 1. ""We are ready for stores to open, for businesses to open, offices, theaters, full strength,"" he said.
Thursday's GDP report showed that consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, surged at a 10.7% annual rate in the January-March quarter, a significant acceleration after spending had slowed to a 2.3% annual gain in the final three months of 2020. As consumers spend more freely, employers are likely to keep hiring to keep up with customer demand. Daco said he thinks job growth in some months this year will surpass the nearly 1 million that were added in March.
As American consumers have stepped up their spending in recent months, they have consumed physical goods far more than they have services, like haircuts, airline tickets and restaurant meals. Spending on goods accelerated at an annual pace of nearly 24% last quarter; services spending rose at a rate below 5%. That disparity will likely shift as more restaurants and entertainment venues reopen and people increasingly travel and congregate. On Friday, for example, Disneyland will reopen, with limited capacity, to California residents.
Andrew Song, whose family owns Kwan's Deli across from Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park, is finally feeling hopeful after having lost most of his business last year as office workers stayed home. The deli should be able to sustain itself, Song said, from a rise in hotel guests, conventiongoers and tourists, even if office workers don't all return. Recently, he called a laid-off employee back to work.
Song credited the rebound, at least in part, to the rise in vaccinations, which he thinks has made Americans more comfortable about venturing out.
""More tourists are coming,"" he said. ""We're seeing some familiar faces back inside the restaurant.""
Consumers weren't alone in driving last month's growth. Business investment rose at a strong rate of nearly 10%, reflecting a burst of spending on equipment. And government spending grew at a 6.3% annual rate after two straight declines that had reflected weakness at the state and local level as the recession shrank tax revenue.
Businesses did slow their pace of inventory restocking, which shaved 2.6 percentage points from the quarter's growth. And a rising trade deficit diminished growth by 0.8 percentage point.
But Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, suggested that even that weakness masked evidence of strength: With the U.S. recovery ahead of much of the rest of the world's, Americans are spending more than consumers overseas are.
""The GDP number was robust and signals that the economy is off and running,"" Zandi said. ""Consumers are out buying aggressively.""

WASHINGTON (AP) — Fewer Americans are reluctant to get a COVID-19 vaccine than just a few months ago, but questions about side effects and how the shots were tested still hold some back, according to a new poll that highlights the challenges at a pivotal moment in the U.S. vaccination campaign.
Just 11% of people who remain unvaccinated say they definitely will get the shot, while 34% say they definitely won't, according to the poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
That leaves a large swath of Americans in the middle who might still roll up their sleeves — including 27% who say they probably will and 27% who say they probably won't — if someone credible addressed their concerns. That's where National Institutes of Health immunologist Kizzmekia Corbett comes in.
Corbett helped lead development of the Moderna shot, and she spends hours giving plain-spoken answers to questions from Americans — especially Black Americans like her — to counter misinformation about the three vaccines used in the U.S.
No, COVID-19 vaccines won't cause infertility: ""Whoever started that rumor, shame on you.""
No, the shots' speedy development doesn't mean corners were cut: ""We worked our butts off for the last six years"" hunting vaccines for earlier cousins of COVID-19 — a head start that made the difference, Corbett recently told the AP.
Getting as many people vaccinated as fast as possible is critical to returning the country to normal. More than 150 million people — about 58% of all adults — have received at least one dose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
As that number grows, reluctance is inching down. Overall, the AP-NORC poll found about 1 in 5 American adults say they probably or definitely won't get vaccinated, compared to about a third in January, when the shots were just rolling out.
Related:
Black Americans likewise are becoming more open to the shots, with 26% now saying they definitely or probably won't get vaccinated compared with 41% in January. That's similar to the 22% of Hispanic Americans and white Americans the poll found unlikely to get vaccinated. Among Asian Americans, just 9% say they definitely or probably won't get the shots.
Holdouts are from all over American society — fueling experts' advice that there is no one-size-fits-all vaccine message and that people need to hear from trusted sources, whether that's scientists like Corbett or their own doctors. Adults under 45, rural Americans and Republicans are especially likely to say they will avoid vaccination, the poll found. But again, attitudes are changing: 32% of Republicans now say they probably or definitely won't get vaccinated, down from 44% in January.
About three-fourths of those who say they are unlikely to get vaccinated have little to no confidence that the vaccines were properly tested, and 55% are very concerned about side effects, the poll found. Even among those who say they will probably get vaccinated but have not done so yet, concerns about proper testing are elevated compared with people who have received their shots already.
In forums hosted by colleges, Black pastors, doctors and even basketball great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Corbett says the best way to overcome distrust is to put the science in understandable terms for strangers just like she does for family. Later this spring, she's moving from the NIH to Harvard's School of Public Health to continue both her vaccine research and that outreach to communities, the school plans to announce on Tuesday.
The vaccines' speedy development ""is historic and it is brag-worthy,"" said Corbett, whose NIH team was able to customize a shot that matched the new virus after spending six years developing vaccines against other dangerous coronaviruses such as MERS.
But ""really, we should have started the conversations very early about what went into it,"" she said, so the public understood that no steps were skipped.
A combination of huge studies and real-world data show the main side effects of the U.S. vaccines are temporary fevers or aches as the immune system revs up. The shots are undergoing unprecedented safety monitoring, which last month led to a temporary pause in Johnson & Johnson vaccinations to determine how to handle an incredibly rare risk of blood clots.
Even after that pause, overall confidence in the vaccines is up slightly compared with a few months ago, with 45% of all adults now very or extremely confident that the shots were properly tested for safety and effectiveness, compared with 39% in an AP-NORC poll in February.
But side effect myths persist. Corbett calls the fertility concern ""completely absurd,"" and in forum after forum explains why it's biologically impossible for the vaccines to alter anyone's DNA.
The repetition is OK: ""People need to hear things multiple times,"" she said.
Plus, many Americans have some of the same questions scientists are still trying to answer, such as whether or when people might need a booster dose.
""Those are things that even I can't even answer. But what I can say is that we're doing everything we can to make sure we can answer it as soon as possible,"" Corbett said.

ATLANTA (CNN) — Vaccine passports have been touted by some as our ticket to normalcy — easily accessible proof of immunization and a reward for those who got their shots. They've also been called invasive and ineffective.
The debate over proof of vaccination as a requirement for entry dates back more than 120 years. The first time certificates of vaccines were required, health officials were fighting a plague pandemic.
In the 1890s, the Government of British India enacted a series of measures in an attempt to stop the spread of the plague, which included requiring travelers to prove they'd been vaccinated against the bacterial disease.
But colonized people living in India then saw government-mandated vaccine certificates as an invasive measure meant to curb travel and control citizens' movements. Officials struggled to enforce the requirement as they were outnumbered by people traveling across the country.
Today's concept of a vaccine ""passport"" isn't much different: It's proof of vaccination — either on paper or in digital form — that grants someone access or entry to venues, foreign countries and other locations. It's meant to keep those who haven't been vaccinated out of public areas where they could transmit the coronavirus — and reward people who've been vaccinated with a return to somewhat normal life.
The US federal government won't require vaccine passports or issue them, so the passports' viability lies with the states.
New York is already testing its digital vaccine passport, the Excelsior Pass app. Meanwhile, Florida and Texas' Republican governors signed orders prohibiting the passports, both citing privacy issues. All three states have seen some of the country's highest numbers of Covid-19 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
If history is any indication, the adoption of vaccine passports won't happen smoothly or all at once. They were difficult to enforce in the 1890s — and if more Americans and international citizens resist, the same could be true in 2021 and beyond.
Colonized people of India rejected vaccine passports
The vaccine verification debate goes back to the 1890s, during the third global plague pandemic. The scientist who created the first effective vaccine for a bacterial disease, Dr. Waldemar Haffkine, had joined the Government of India while it was under British rule and was commissioned to stymy the spread of the plague in the country, said Rene Najera, an infectious disease epidemiologist and editor of the History of Vaccines project, led by the private medical society The College of Physicians of Philadelphia.
Haffkine eventually repeated the success of his anti-cholera vaccine with a vaccine for the plague, which he initially used to inoculate himself and incarcerated people in a Bombay jail, Najera said.
But tensions between government officials and colonized peoples were already high by that time, he said, and came to a head in 1897, when the Epidemic Diseases Act was passed. The legislation gave officials permission to take public health measures that citizens considered ""very intrusive,"" Najera said.
Health officials would force plague patients out of their homes, often with the help of local police or the military, and burn down rat-infested buildings, since the rodents were known to spread the plague. Citizens were also required to carry vaccination certificates.
The measures taken by British officials led to civil unrest across the country, through work strikes and demonstrations that often turned violent. As a result, many colonized people began leaving crowded urban centers for homes in regions where the colonial government was less present.
The problem, Najera said, was that those citizens brought the plague with them.
Officials in British India were concerned about Hindu and Muslim pilgrimage sites, as well, where thousands of people could gather at once, Sanjoy Bhattacharya, a University of York history professor, told NPR last week.
Najera said the pilgrimages ""were only part of the impetus for certificates of immunization.""
""It was just one of the many things the government tried to do to stop the mass exodus from cities with plague.""
Not that requiring certificates halted travel — the sheer number of people moving around India proved the control measures ineffective, Najera said.
""While certificates were required, the enforcement was lax or nearly impossible to do,"" he said. ""And, if it was done in a way that inhibited the movement of people who were already upset and escaping the plague epidemic in their own city, violence would erupt.""
One kind of vaccine passport still exists
There's one version of the vaccine passport that's been implemented: The ""yellow card,"" or proof of vaccination for yellow fever that some countries require of travelers to prevent the spread of the disease.
It's the only disease specifically mentioned in the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Health Regulations, though many countries set their own requirements for vaccinations. (Najera noted that countries like New Zealand and Australia required the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine for travelers during the resurgence of measles in 2019.)
It's up to countries on how to enforce or proceed the WHO's guidelines, Najera said.
But in the US, the power to enforce proof of vaccination would belong to the states and local officials. The White House said last week that while the Biden administration supports setting standards for people to prove they're vaccinated, it won't issue vaccine passports or mandate vaccine credentials.
The US adopted a piecemeal approach to the pandemic when it first began in March 2020, largely entrusting states to make their own guidelines on wearing masks, limiting the capacity of buildings and other ways of mitigating residents' risk of Covid-19 transmission.
And if some states are already prohibiting the use of vaccine passports while others encourage it, the US could see imperfect enforcement, too.

Is it safe to go to big sporting events during the pandemic?
Not yet, but there are ways to make it safer if you go.
""Yelling, chanting, hugging and generally pouring out our sports enthusiasm is still not the safest activity,"" noted Jennifer Dowd, associate professor of population health at University of Oxford and chief scientific officer of Dear Pandemic, a website that offers expert opinions.
If you do decide to go to a game, outdoor stadiums are safer than indoor arenas, which won't be as well ventilated. Venues that limit attendance and require masks are safer as well. Some teams are requiring proof of vaccination or a negative test for the coronavirus.
Once at the stadium, avoid indoor bars, restaurants and box seating, Dowd said. ""Spaces that are indoors with lots of people eating and drinking without masks are still among the riskiest,"" she said.
Going to a game is much safer if you're fully vaccinated, notes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the agency advises wearing masks at crowded sports events regardless of whether you've had your shots.
Evidence on the safety of big games is mixed. The NFL says it safely hosted 1.2 million fans at 119 games during the 2020 season. Some studies that haven't yet been vetted by outside experts have reached differing conclusions about whether the football season led to more infections. The study findings can't be certain, since they were based on disease rates in counties, not on contact tracing investigations.
Dr. Peter Hotez, an infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said enough Americans will likely be fully vaccinated by June or July to see significant declines in transmission of the virus.
""The risk won't go to zero,"" Hotez said, but it will drop enough that sporting events, restaurants and larger gatherings may be much safer.
The CDC offers additional guidance to help sports fans make decisions as the pandemic continues, such as checking with event organizers about what safety measures are being taken. An important reminder: If you have symptoms, are waiting for a virus test result or have been exposed to someone who's infected, you should stay home, the CDC says.

NEW YORK (AP) — Many Broadway productions are scrambling to resume ticket sales in the coming days to welcome theater-goers this fall after city and state leaders have green-lit a reopening of the Great White Way at full capacity by mid-September.
""We remain cautiously optimistic about Broadway's ability to resume performances this fall and are happy that fans can start buying tickets again,"" Charlotte St. Martin, president of the Broadway League, said in a statement Wednesday.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Broadway theaters can reopen Sept. 14 and will be allowed to decide their own entry requirements, like whether people must prove they've been vaccinated to attend a show. Selling tickets will allow theaters to gauge interest before stages open, said Robert Mujica, Cuomo's budget director.
""Phantom of the Opera,"" Broadway's longest-running show, announced Wednesday it would resume performances on Oct. 22, with tickets going on sale Friday. More shows are expected to circle return dates in the coming weeks.
Actors' Equity Association, the national labor union representing more than 51,000 actors and stage managers in live theater, said the news meant the theater community is ""one step closer to the safe reopening"" of Broadway.
""We look forward to continuing our conversations with the Broadway League about a safe reopening and know that soon the time will come when members can go back to doing what they do best, creating world-class theater,"" said Mary McColl, executive director of Actors' Equity.
The Broadway that reopens will look different. In May, the big budget Disney musical ""Frozen"" decided not to reopen when Broadway theaters restart, marking the first time an established show had been felled by the coronavirus pandemic. Producers of ""Mean Girls"" also decided not to restart.
But there will be new shows, including Antoinette Chinonye Nwandu's ""Pass Over"" that is slated to reopen the August Wilson Theatre, the same venue ""Mean Girls"" has vacated. And a Shubert theater has been promised for playwright Keenan Scott II's play ""Thoughts of a Colored Man.""
The lifting of all capacity restrictions has long been considered by the industry as crucial to any reopening plan since Broadway economics demand full venue capacity. Some off-Broadway shows have already reopened with limited capacity.
All city theaters abruptly closed on March 12, 2020, knocking out all shows, including 16 that were still scheduled to open.
Some scheduled spring 2020 shows — like a musical about Michael Jackson and a revival of Neil Simon's ""Plaza Suite"" starring Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker — pushed their productions to 2021. But others abandoned their plans, including ""Hangmen"" and a revival of Edward Albee's ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?""

SALT LAKE CITY — State leaders thanked Utah Department of Health state epidemiologist Dr. Angela Dunn Thursday as she made her final appearance at Utah's weekly COVID-19 news conference ahead of leaving the agency this summer.
Dunn, who has become a household name in Utah during the pandemic, is leaving the state health department to become the executive director of the Salt Lake County Health Department later this summer. Her first day in her new role will be June 1.
Dunn has been a consistent presence throughout the pandemic at the state's weekly briefings, where she has explained the latest COVID-19 information under the administrations of both current Utah Gov. Spencer Cox and former Gov. Gary Herbert.
Cox wore an ""I Love Dr. Dunn"" T-shirt at Thursday's news conference to commemorate the occasion. He thanked the epidemiologist for her work over the past 14 months to protect Utahns from COVID-19.
""I just want (Dunn) to know how grateful we are for everything that she has done over the past year. We've been so fortunate to have her leadership and her guidance,"" Cox said. ""She'll do a tremendous job (in Salt Lake County). You're getting one of the best.""
Lt. Gov Deidre Henderson lamented that she didn't have a shirt like Cox's, but she echoed the governor's words of gratitude.
""She has saved lives,"" Henderson said of Dunn. ""The work she has done for our state has saved many lives.""
Dunn added her own message of thanks Thursday.
""Thank you,"" she said. ""Thank you to the state of Utah, to my Utah Department of Health family, of course the media, and all the Utahns out there who have been such a great support over the past 14 months.""
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox provided a COVID-19 pandemic update at his weekly news conference Thursday morning. Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson and Utah Department of Health state epidemiologist Dr. Angela Dunn also spoke at the event.
Watch the replay of the news conference below.
Vaccine equity improving
The state's efforts to close the vaccine equity gap are continuing to improve, Henderson said Thursday.
The state has received over 200 requests from organizations who want to host their own mobile vaccine clinics, Henderson said. Those clinics accounted for about 27,000 vaccine doses over the past week since the state began the initiative, she added.
""That's something that we're really excited about,"" Henderson said.
Mass vaccination sites will continue to be available, but the state is shifting toward a model where vaccines are being brought to the people, instead of people coming to the vaccines, she said. Health officials are focusing on people who want to get vaccinated but haven't been able to yet, Henderson added.
About 41% of Asian Utahns have now received at least one dose of the vaccine, according to state data. About 34% of Hispanic Utahns, 23% of Black Utahns and 23% of Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander Utahns have received at least a first dose. However, about 51% of white Utahns have received at least one dose, so there is still some ground to be made up.
Additionally, about 87% of Utahns age 65 and older have now received at least one dose, and 76% of that age group are now fully vaccinated, Henderson said.
""We are just so incredibly grateful for that,"" she said.
A new texting resources is now available to find vaccine appointments via a text message. Utahns can text their ZIP code to GetVax (438-829) and receive a reply with three vaccination locations in your area. Spanish speakers can text their ZIP code to ""vacuna"" (822-862) to receive information on three vaccination locations in their area.
Pfizer vaccine expected to open to 12-15 age group next week
The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is expected to get approval from federal regulators for use in the 12-15 age group early next week, Dunn said.
She predicted that COVID-19 cases will plummet when Utahns in that age group are able to be vaccinated. The 12-15 age group is contributing to the current spread of COVID-19 in Utah, and vaccinating them should slow that down significantly, Dunn said.
She encouraged parents to make a vaccination appointment for their children as soon as the vaccine eligibility opens up.
""This is the most important next step we can do as a state to end this pandemic,"" Dunn said.
Vaccinating that age group will also make extracurricular activities safer for school students, and classrooms will be safer environments for teachers, staff and students when school starts again in the fall, Dunn added.
Though most state and local health orders ended this week as required by Utah's pandemic endgame bill, HB294, school mask mandates will remain in place until June 15 or the end of the school year, whichever comes first. The state's ""test to play"" protocol for schools, where students must be periodically tested for COVID-19 in order to participate in extracurricular activities, also will remain in place until the end of the school year, Cox said.
New COVID-19 cases
Utah's number of COVID-19 cases increased by 395 on Thursday, with no deaths and 17,760 vaccinations reported, according to the Utah Department of Health. The state has been in a plateau for the past several weeks, but saw cases start to drop once again over the past week, Cox said.
There are now an estimated 8,053 active cases of COVID-19 in Utah. The rolling seven-day average number of positive cases per day is now at 343, according to the health department. The positive test rate per day for that time period calculated with the ""people over people"" method is now 6.7%. The positive test rate per day for that time period calculated with the ""test over test"" method is now 3.5%.
There are 142 COVID-19 patients currently hospitalized in Utah, including 58 in intensive care, state data shows. About 74% of intensive care unit beds are now occupied in Utah, including about 77% of ICU beds in the state's 16 referral hospitals. About 56% of non-ICU hospital beds are now occupied in the state.
A total of 2,242,271 vaccine doses have been administered in the state, up from 2,223,511 Wednesday. A total of 1,332,783 Utahns have now received at least a first dose of the vaccine, and 999,505 are now fully vaccinated, the health department reported. A total of 2,652,878 vaccine doses have been shipped to the state so far.
About 41.6% of all Utahns have received at least a first vaccine dose, and 31.2% are now fully vaccinated. Among Utahns age 16 and older who are currently eligible for the vaccine, about 56% have received at least one dose, and 42% are fully vaccinated, state data shows.
Thursday's new numbers indicate a 0.1% increase in positive cases since Wednesday. Of the 2,588,877 people tested for COVID-19 in Utah so far, 15.4% have tested positive for the disease. The number of total tests conducted since the pandemic began in Utah is now 4,707,400, up 13,562 since Wednesday. Of those, 6,695 were tests of people who had not previously been tested for COVID-19.
Thursday's totals give Utah 399,374 total confirmed cases, with 16,303 total hospitalizations and 2,219 total deaths from the disease. An estimated 389,102 Utah COVID-19 cases are now considered recovered, the health department reports.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) — Fully vaccinated visitors to Walt Disney Co's U.S. theme parks will not be required to wear face masks in most areas starting on Tuesday, the company said, as the country's COVID-19 cases continue to decline.
The new policy applies to guests at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, and the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California.
Disney will not require proof of immunization, the company said in a blog post. But it said it expects people who are not fully vaccinated to continue wearing masks at indoor locations, except when dining.
Masks will be required for all guests on transportation, including buses, monorails and the Disney Skyliner gondolas.
Physical distancing will no longer be required at Disneyland as California has dropped that mandate for theme parks.
At Walt Disney World, some experiences and entertainment might still operate with limited capacity, the company said.
""We're not quite ready to bring back everything yet, but we are optimistic and look forward to the day when Disney pals and princesses are able to hug once again,"" the company said.

SALT LAKE CITY — As urban tourism and the convention market slowly make their way back to pre-pandemic levels, Salt Lake County tourism officials want travelers to know that it is more than a city-meets-outdoors destination.
Yes, the county is throwing out everything you may have thought you knew about Salt Lake City and Salt Lake County. With a new brand campaign launched Thursday with the slogan ""West of Conventional,"" county officials want you to think of it as a place where differences blend.
Building off the dynamic of outdoors next to urban life, the new ""intersection"" brand focuses on other differences: It's a ""meeting place"" where history and new development meet and where ""traditional outlooks mingle with progressive ideals.""
""We are different. We're a city of juxtapositions,"" said Kaitlin Eskelson, president and CEO of Visit Salt Lake, a private, nonprofit organization that promotes Salt Lake County tourism. ""We have the urban and the mountains. Some of our taglines are a little bit 'hallowed ground,' a little bit 'breaking new ground.' Things that shouldn't really go together miraculously do here in Salt Lake. And that's so different from what our competitors are able to offer.""
The county and Visit Salt Lake worked with Wisconsin-based marketing agency BVK to develop a new brand that centers around the bonds found in Salt Lake City. Stephanie Barkow, the senior vice president of insights and planning for the agency, said the goal of the project was to find something that presented travelers with what they are seeking out of a destination but also represent what Salt Lake City and Salt Lake County have to offer.
They conducted an ""extensive competitive communications audit"" of other cities in and near the intermountain West, like Albuquerque, N.M.; Boise, Idaho; Denver; Portland, Oregon; Reno-Tahoe, Nevada; and Tucson, Arizona, that Salt Lake City competes with when it tries to bring in conventions and leisure travelers. This audit reviewed what other markets had and how those markets advertised themselves so they could find a brand that differed from the competition.
Barkow said there was ""a ton of overlap"" when it came to ""recreation meets urban lifestyle"" messages from the different cities.
""We knew we needed to find something that was nuanced, that was different and that really helped cling to what Salt Lake is all about,"" she explained.
To get there, researchers with BVK had to take a few steps. They interviewed residents with all sorts of backgrounds and found that, of course, residents do highly value the region's beauty; however, they were also quick to mention their appreciation of how ""open-minded and inclusive and vibrant and worldly and forward-looking"" the area is, Barkow said. The people they spoke to viewed it as a place where people come together despite the different backgrounds.
Inspired by what they heard from residents, BVK market analysts then started what's called a traveler perception study. They interviewed nearly 1,000 regional and distant travelers from an equally diverse set of backgrounds to see if it was clear to outsiders that Salt Lake was what Salt Lakers viewed their community as.
Salt Lake is so much more modern and fresh, open-minded and vibrant than people realize. It is a place that empowers open minds and unconventional thinking for a better way.
–Stephanie Barkow, BVK's senior vice president of insights and planning
Researchers found that outsiders have the perception that Salt Lake area is beautiful and home to many outdoor activities. They also view it as a safe place and a great place to raise a family. But the interviewed outsiders didn't pick up other details that residents are most proud of.
""They didn't recognize the vibrancy (Salt Lake City and Salt Lake County) has, the rich cultural scene, the arts scene, the entertainment,"" Barkow said. ""So what was happening is they were choosing to go to other places that had all of the things ... because they thought they would have a richer experience in those destinations.""
From there, they took the other parts of the traveler survey: what the outsiders look for when they travel somewhere. They found that Salt Lake City and Salt Lake County have what travelers want but the perception of it lags behind reality.
""Salt Lake is so much more modern and fresh, open-minded and vibrant than people realize,"" she added. ""It is a place that empowers open minds and unconventional thinking for a better way. It's a place that's multifaceted and fresh.""
A new tourism brand concept was born.
Along with the new brand conception, Salt Lake County and Visit Salt Lake officials unveiled a new logo Thursday that features a salt crystal design. It represents the many facets of Salt Lake County, which aligns with the new targeted brand approach. Salt Lake County officials said they believe it's a brand campaign that's broad enough to fit different tourism sectors in the region.
Thursday's announcement comes at a pivotal time for urban tourism. The COVID-19 pandemic decimated the tourism industry across the globe, including Utah. While tourism in rural parts of the state — especially places near national parks — has already rebounded and even thrived, tourism in urban Utah is slowly getting back on track.
The exact economic damage to Salt Lake County tourism from the pandemic is still being calculated but estimates are that it's at least in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The loss of conventions in 2020 alone resulted in an estimated $357 million blow to the county. Lags in Salt Lake County's tourism industry also mean lags for the state as a whole since the county brought in more than one-third of the state's entire tourism spending in 2019, when tourism resulted in $10 billion for the state.
But Eskelson and Salt Lake County officials believe there was a silver lining from last year's experience. Visit Salt Lake had time to review Salt Lake City and Salt Lake County's tourism brand and see how it could be improved. They wanted something ""big and bold"" for when leisure and business travel rebounds, which is expected to happen as early as this summer as more people have received the COVID-19 vaccine and there are fewer restrictions tied to the coronavirus in place.
Salt Lake County Deputy Mayor Erin Litvack explained that they picked Thursday to release the new brand to help the region gain market share just as the travel economy rebounds. The new brand will be promoted immediately locally, regionally and nationally through mostly digital and social media methods, according to Eskelson.
The county also plans to unveil 10 new murals across the county and use a mobile salt cave at various conventions to help promote the new brand throughout the summer.
""This brand is a key piece to our recovery,"" Litvack said. ""It feels a little bit of a rebirth — if you will — of our industry. The new visitor economy is upon us and we will secure our place in it. It is the perfect opportunity to up our game in how we attract visitors.""",2021-06-03T00:00:00Z,2021,2,22

SALT LAKE CITY — A majority of Utahns support the ongoing mask mandate in Utah's K-12 schools, a recent Deseret News/Hinckley Institute of Politics poll shows.
When asked if they agree with Gov. Spencer Cox administration's decision to continue the mandate beyond the April 10 date when the statewide mask order otherwise ended under HB294, 63% of Utahns said they either strongly or somewhat agree.
Meanwhile, 35% said they somewhat or strongly disagree with order while 3% said they were not sure, according to poll results.
Cox announced on Facebook Thursday morning that the statewide mask mandate for schoolchildren will end the last week of school. Previously, the order said it would end the last day of school or June 15, whichever came first.
""Schools and districts can still require masks. We are making this a local decision. Please be respectful of the local decision-making process,"" he wrote.
As the school year winds to a close, some school districts have announced they will not enforce wearing masks at school, the largest among them Washington County School District, which serves nearly 40,000 students.
However, Washington County school officials are encouraging students to continue to wear masks.
Morgan County School Board took a similar stance, said spokeswoman Gwen Romero.
""The feeling was more or less just let these last couple of weeks feel more like normal so that people can be feeling a little more optimistic about coming back to school in the fall, and leave some of those health decisions more up to the individuals,"" she said.
Romero, who also teaches for the school district, has observed ""most of the students and staff are choosing not to mask.""
The issue has become increasingly contentious as Utahns who object to the state-level mandate have rallied outside of school district administration offices, disrupted school board meetings to the point that at least one had to be adjourned and parents have attempted to seek entry to schools with their children who were not wearing masks without recognized exemptions.
Amid mounting pressure from parents, Cox recently announced the state has no plans to require masks for students in K-12 schools next fall, saying rising vaccination rates indicate districts are prepared to limit restrictions.
The earlier state order for schools took into account that federal regulators had not yet approved coronavirus vaccines for children. Earlier this week, the Food and Drug Administration lowered the age that people in the United States can receive Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine to 12.
Other rationales for the state school mask mandate have not changed: Children can get sick from COVID-19 and have long-term effects; not all adults in school settings have been vaccinated; and the virus can still be spread by asymptomatic children.
Heidi Matthews, president of the Utah Education Association, said the organization has consistently supported the guidance of doctors and public health officials regarding public health practices and policies intended to enhance public health during the pandemic.
""I think this survey really indicates that most people do understand that rationale,"" Matthews said.
The poll, conducted by independent pollster Scott Rasmussen for the Deseret News and the University of Utah's Hinckley Institute of Politics, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. Rasmussen's firm surveyed 1,000 registered Utah voters April 30 through May 6, prior to Cox's latest announcements.
Matthews said Utahns, regardless of political ideologies, want students to have everything they need to learn and be successful at school.
""That means supporting our educators so that they can support our students and our and our families. It means taking those precautions so that we don't threaten the health and wellbeing of all people in schools,"" she said.
Among Utahns grouped by ages 18-34 and 35-54, who typically include parents of school-age children, 63% in both groups either strongly or somewhat supported Cox's decision.
Support for the decision was highest among Democrats polled with a combined 90% either strongly or somewhat agreeing with the order. Just under half of respondents who identified as Republicans agree with the order, and there were similar results between those who identified as conservative or liberal.
Meanwhile, 67% of moderates said they either strongly agree or somewhat agree with the ongoing mask mandate in schools.
Among faith groups or those who claim none, the highest support for the decision was among the ""none"" group, of which a combined 73% said they strongly or somewhat agree with the mandate.
Among respondents who identified as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a combined 57% indicated agreement with continuing the mandate compared to a combined 65% among those who identified as ""other"" faith groups.",2021-05-13T00:00:00Z,2021,2,22

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Just a few months ago, California was the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S. Hospitals in Los Angeles were drowning in patients, and ambulances were idling outside with people struggling to breathe, waiting for beds to open.
The death count was staggering — so many that morgues filled and refrigerated trucks were brought in to handle the overflow.
Now as cases spike in other parts of the country, California has gone from worst to first with the lowest infection rate in the U.S. even as it has moved quickly to reopen more businesses with greater customer counts and allow larger gatherings.
A scramble to get COVID-19 vaccinations has given way to an open invite in many places. Where people lined up hours and counties struggled to get doses, there now appears to be a glut of the shots in many locations.
""It has been a success story for California to have gone from our, if you will, viral tsunami that happened after the back-to-back holiday season to where we are now,"" said Dr. Robert Kim-Farley of the University of California, Los Angeles' public health school.
At the peak of California's winter surge that followed the Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's holidays, the state was recording 40,000 new cases daily and well above 500 deaths per day. Those numbers have dwindled to 2,300 new cases and 68 deaths daily.
The state surpassed Hawaii on Thursday with the lowest average number of cases per capita in the past two weeks, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. One in every 2,416 people in California tested positive in the past week. At the other end of the spectrum, one in every 223 people in Michigan was diagnosed with the virus.
Kim-Farley said it's been like turning around a massive tanker ship to reach today's level of improvement. He credited government and public health agencies with providing clear guidelines that businesses, schools and individuals largely followed, including mask mandates and social distancing.
Gov. Gavin Newsom has been allowing businesses and schools to reopen by county based on case levels. At different points in the pandemic, he has faced heavy criticism for being too restrictive, and now some worry he is moving too quickly.
All counties have improved enough to move out of the strictest of four tiers, and 38 of the 58 counties — accounting for 87% of the state's population — now are in the second least-restrictive tier. Newsom said he plans to lift most remaining coronavirus restrictions by June 15.
The pandemic has surged unevenly across the U.S.
Cases were low in California a year ago, compared with New York, where hospitals were overwhelmed last spring. When California was in the throes of a second winter spike in mid-January, Michigan cases were tapering to a low point in February before surging to the highest current infection rate in the U.S.
Kim-Farley said California's surge had put fear into more people to wear masks, a rule still in place that he said he has helped prevent a resurgence.
""Some states in the United States that lifted mask mandates are suffering the consequences of that with increasing numbers of cases while we are continuing to see decreases,"" he said.
California struggled with its vaccine rollout like other states, limiting doses to health workers and elderly who were more at risk of being hospitalized or dying. Doses have increased as cases have tapered, and the high number of infections over the winter also led to a certain level of natural immunity.
Only weeks ago, counties struggled to get doses. The state limited eligibility for the precious vaccine, and stories abounded of cheaters jumping the line to get a shot.
The Vaccine Spotter website that helps book appointments showed a state map Thursday awash in green dots, indicating available appointments. Many were available the same day, and some sites were allowing people to show up without appointments.
Los Angeles County opened up sites in Palmdale and Lancaster to walk-ups. The largest mass vaccination clinic in Napa County saw demand drop from a flood to a trickle just days after California last week expanded vaccine eligibility to everyone 16 and older. It's also allowing walk-ins.
""We definitely have the capacity,"" county spokeswoman Janet Upton said. ""But now what we're lacking is, seemingly, public interest.""
California has about 40 million residents, and a little more than half the 32 million eligible for vaccines have gotten at least one shot.
A combination of concern over reports of rare complications along with misinformation and conspiracy theories and a sense among some that the danger has waned has led to vaccine hesitancy.
Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer tried to persuade more people to set aside worries about the vaccine, noting that the chance of a serious side effect is the same as dying in a 200-mile road trip that most people would not hesitate to take.
""The risk of having a serious side effect from COVID vaccine is about one in a million,″ she said. ""We take these tiny risks every day as we go about our lives because we know what's on the other side of it is so worthwhile. Similarly, the return to normal that's on the other side of vaccination is worthwhile.""
With the rollout of the vaccine, mortuaries that had run out of space have returned to normal.
""It's the difference between night and day,"" said Todd Beckley, the general manager of Inglewood Cemetery Mortuary. ""There was a time where we had nine deaths a day, and they were all COVID. We haven't had a COVID death in four days.""

INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) — The murder trial of multimillionaire Robert Durst resumed Monday without the defendant present and with arguments about whether the case should continue after a rare 14-month recess.
Judge Mark Windham questioned jurors in Los Angeles County Superior Court to see if they can complete their assignment that was interrupted in March 2020 during the pandemic. If so, it could be a first for the U.S. legal system.
""So, where did we leave off?"" Windham said as jurors laughed.
The length of the stoppage is unprecedented and it's the highest-profile U.S. case postponed because of the pandemic, Durst's lawyers say. They have repeatedly — and unsuccessfully — sought a mistrial because they argued the delay harmed his chance of a fair trial.
Durst, 78, an heir to a New York commercial real estate empire, has pleaded not guilty in the killing of his best friend, Susan Berman, at her Los Angeles home in 2000.
Windham, wearing a black mask, approached the 22 jurors — one fewer than before the recess — and addressed the many losses of the pandemic.
""You've likely had losses or like me know people that have lost loved ones,"" he said.
He asked jurors if they had seen stories about the case or discussed it with anyone during the break and if they had any health concerns or hardships that would prevent them from serving another four to five months.
After speaking in chambers with nine jurors, Windham dismissed one from service, leaving 21 on the panel that is scheduled to hear a new round of opening statements Tuesday.
Before the jurors returned to court, Windham denied a defense request to suspend the case further because Durst has bladder cancer and myriad other health problems that require hospitalization.
""The question isn't whether he can endure the rigors of the trial,"" attorney Dick DeGuerin said. ""It's whether he can survive at all.""
Deputy District Attorney John Lewin scoffed at claims Durst needed to be released to a hospital for treatment, saying he was getting high-quality care at the jail, where he is being held without bail.
""It's a get out of jail free card,"" Lewin said. ""The goal here is simply to have this trial go away.""
Durst was not in court because he refused to leave the Los Angeles County jail, Windham said. DeGuerin questioned that account, saying jailers had previously failed to get Durst and inaccurately reported he was ""willfully absent.""
DeGuerin said measures taken to prevent the spread of the coronavirus would harm Durst's defense by keeping his lawyers scattered throughout the courtroom and unable to confer. Windham said the measures were required to keep everyone safe, though he and all the lawyers have been vaccinated.
Windham moved the case to a larger courtroom in Inglewood to accommodate the distancing needed to resume.
The lead lawyers were seated alone in the front of the courtroom and their co-counsel were spread throughout jury boxes on both sides of the courtroom. Plexiglas panels were placed between the lawyers and a court stenographer.
Jurors were handed zip-lock bags with note pads, a mask and tissues as they entered the courtroom and took seats in the gallery.
Prosecutors say Durst silenced Berman before she could tell police she helped him cover up the killing of his wife, Kathie, in New York in 1982.
Durst, who is worth more than an estimated $100 million, is only charged with Berman's killing but prosecutors are using his wife's disappearance and a neighbor's slaying in Texas to build their case against him.
He was acquitted in the Texas case after he testified he shot the man in self-defense. Prosecutors say he killed Morris Black because Durst was in hiding and the elderly neighbor discovered his identity.
He has never been charged in his wife's suspected killing and has denied any role in her disappearance.
Prosecutors in Westchester County, New York, said Monday that they were reviewing the killing of Kathie Durst as one of several unsolved homicides.
During opening statements in Los Angeles last year, defense lawyer Dick DeGuerin, who defended Durst in Texas, said Durst didn't kill Berman and doesn't know who did. But he said his client had found her body, panicked and bolted.
Durst sent police a cryptic note alerting them to a ""cadaver"" in the house only to ensure she would be found, DeGuerin said. Durst had long denied penning the note.
Durst was arrested in New Orleans in 2015 on the eve of the final episode of ""The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst,"" an HBO documentary in which he was confronted with the cadaver note and a letter he once sent Berman with the same block print handwriting and the city of Beverly Hills similarly misspelled ""Beverley.""
Before being shown the letter he had written to Berman, Durst told the filmmakers that only the killer could have written the cadaver note.
After the ""gotcha"" moment on camera, he was caught on a hot mic saying to himself in a bathroom, ""You're caught! What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.""

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. highways will be far busier over the Memorial Day holiday weekend than last year, but traffic still won't reach pre-pandemic levels, according to a forecast by the AAA auto club.
AAA officials say travel will increase because more Americans have been vaccinated against COVID-19 — about one-third of U.S. adults — and consumer confidence is growing.
The auto club and insurance company said Tuesday it expects more than 37 million people to travel at least 50 miles from home during the holiday weekend, up 60% from last year, which was the lowest since AAA began keeping records in 2000.
If the AAA forecast is right, however, it would still be 6 million people, or 13%, fewer than left home over Memorial Day in 2019.
AAA said 34 million Americans plan driving trips between May 27 and May 31, a 52% increase over last year, and nearly 2.5 million will take plane trips, nearly six times more than the same period in 2020. A small number will take buses or trains.
So far in May, nearly 1.5 million people per day have gone through U.S. airport checkpoints, according to the Transportation Security Administration. AAA said its air-travel forecast seems low because it counts each traveler once, while TSA counts somebody twice if they take a round-trip flight.

SALT LAKE CITY — Utah health officials reported 1,885 new COVID-19 cases and 15 additional deaths on Thursday.
Of the new cases, 436 were school-age children, according to a daily update provided by the Utah Department of Health.
The rolling seven-day average for new cases is now 1,675 per day, and the average percent positivity rate of those tested stands at 13.5%.
Health care workers administered 9,427 vaccines since Wednesday's report, bringing total vaccinations given in Utah to 3,366,292 doses.
In the last 28 days, unvaccinated residents have faced 5.3 times greater risk of dying from COVID-19, 6.8 times greater risk of being hospitalized due to the coronavirus and 6 times greater risk of testing positive than vaccinated people, state health officials said in a statement.
Since Feb. 1, unvaccinated residents have experienced 4.8 times greater risk of dying from COVID-19, 5.1 times greater risk of being hospitalized due to the disease and 4.4 times greater risk of testing positive for COVID-19 than vaccinated people, data shows.
Since vaccines became available beginning early this year, the state has confirmed 14,099 breakthrough cases, 752 breakthrough hospitalizations and 83 breakthrough deaths. Cases are counted as breakthrough if they were fully vaccinated more than two weeks before they tested positive for the coronavirus.
On Thursday, 582 people were hospitalized with COVID-19 in Utah, an increase of 12 since the previous day. The state is now seeing among the highest daily counts of hospitalized coronavirus patients. Referral intensive care units that can treat the most seriously ill patients were 97% full with coronavirus patients and others; overall ICU use stood at 95.8%; and nonintensive units across the state were 63.6% full.
Two deaths reported Thursday occurred before September. The latest deaths:
- A Salt Lake County man, 25-44, not hospitalized.
- A Davis County woman, 65-84, hospitalized.
- A Utah County woman, 45-64, hospitalized.
- A Weber County man, 45-64, hospitalized.
- A Utah County man, older than 85, not hospitalized.

SALT LAKE CITY — The Utah Board of Higher Education announced its three finalists to become president of the University of Utah on Wednesday.
They include:
- Dr. Carrie L. Byington, executive vice president for the University of California's health enterprise and a professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco.
- Jayathi Y. Murthy, the Ronald and Valerie Sugar dean at the UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science, and a distinguished professor in the Mechanical and Aerospace Department.
- Taylor R. Randall, dean of the David Eccles School of Business at the University of Utah.
The 32-member search committee selected the finalists after several months of soliciting input through public meetings and in-person interviews.
Ruth V. Watkins stepped down as university president in April after accepting the position of president of Strada Impact. Dr. Michael Good, CEO of U. Health, has served as interim president since then. He did not apply for the presidency position.
""Our extensive search has led us to capable and distinguished candidates who will have the opportunity to be considered by the Utah Board of Higher Education as the next president and leader of the University of Utah,"" Harris H. Simmons, board chairman and search committee co-chairman, said in a statement.
In her current role at the country's largest public academic health care system, according to the board, Byington has led the COVID-19 response. That included ""preparing hospitals for surge, protecting 100,000 health care workers, developing testing, supporting the health and safety of 600,000 students and employees on 10 campuses, coordinating the COVID vaccine rollout and partnering with the state of California to provide expertise and capacity for pandemic response,"" the Board of Higher Education said in the statement.
Byington previously worked at the U. in a number of roles. She was a professor of pediatrics at the U. and as associate vice president of faculty and academic affairs for the U. Health Sciences Center and vice dean for academic affairs and faculty development to the U. School of Medicine.
""As a Mexican-American woman in academic medicine, she has worked throughout her career to end health disparities and increase health equity. She has also worked for a more inclusive academy. In her administrative roles, she has developed and supported faculty mentoring programs and policies and processes for faculty diversity, salary equity and parental leave,"" the Board of Higher Education said.
Officials say Murthy has helped UCLA Samueli grow in technological advancement areas, including engineering in medicine and biology; sustainable and resilient urban systems; artificial intelligence, machine learning and data science; cybersecurity and the future internet; robotics and cyber-physical systems; and advanced materials and manufacturing.
Previously, Murthy taught mechanical engineering as a professor at Arizona State University, Purdue University and Carnegie Mellon University. She was one of the first employees of Fluent, the developer of ""the world's most widely used computational fluid dynamics software.""
Randall started working at the U. in 1999 and has served as dean of the Eccles School of Business for 12 years, during which officials say the value of the school ""increased dramatically"" with the expansion of experiential learning opportunities in ""finance to social impact to policy creation."" During his time as dean, the Marriner S. Eccles Institute for Economics and Quantitative Analysis, the Sorenson Impact Center, the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute and the Goff Strategic Leadership Center opened.
""Under his leadership, the Eccles school has gained a national reputation as a place of innovation, garnering top 10 entrepreneurship rankings for both undergraduate and graduate programs. Currently, seven of the school's programs are ranked in the top 25,"" the Board of Higher Education said.
Before becoming dean, Randall was a professor of accounting for 11 years. With his guidance, the University Venture Fund became the largest student-run venture fund in the country, according to the board.
""I'm grateful to the search committee for their time, commitment and hard work in identifying three tremendous leaders as candidates for University of Utah president. Each would be an outstanding choice to lead Utah's flagship university and is well positioned to continue the U.'s upward trajectory,"" Christian Gardner, search committee co-chairman and chairman of the university's board of trustees, said in the statement.
The finalists will be on the University of Utah campus on Wednesday, Aug. 4 to meet with groups representing faculty, staff, students, trustees and administration, the Board of Higher Education said in a statement. Each finalist will participate in a public meeting that evening, where attendees from the university community and public can ask questions of each candidate.
The following day, the board will interview the finalists in a closed session and will likely select the president that evening.",2021-07-21T00:00:00Z,2021,3,23

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Friday called for national unity as the United States marks the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that killed 2,977 people, calling it America's greatest strength in the face of adversity.
Biden, speaking in a videotaped recording at the White House, honored the memories of those killed in the attacks and the thousands more injured, as well as the firefighters, nurses and many others who risked or gave their lives during the subsequent rescue missions and long road to recovery.
20 years after September 11, 2001, we commemorate the 2,977 lives we lost and honor those who risked and gave their lives. As we saw in the days that followed, unity is our greatest strength. It's what makes us who we are — and we can't forget that. pic.twitter.com/WysK8m3LAb
— President Biden (@POTUS) September 10, 2021
He also acknowledged the ""darker forces of human nature — fear and anger, resentment and violence against Muslim Americans, true and faithful followers of a peaceful religion"" that he said had bent, but not broken, American unity.
""To me, that's the central lesson of Sept. 11, is that at our most vulnerable, in the push and pull of all that makes us human, and the battle for the soul of America, unity is our greatest strength,"" he said.
""Unity doesn't mean we have to believe the same thing. We must have a fundamental respect and faith in each other, and in this nation,"" he added.
The White House released the video on the eve of the 20th anniversary, which Biden will mark by visiting all three sites that were attacked.
In the push and pull of all that makes us human, and the battle for the soul of America, unity is our greatest strength.
–President Joe Biden
On Saturday, Biden and first lady Jill Biden will visit New York City, where two airliners destroyed the World Trade Center and killed 2,753 people; the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, where a third airliner crashed; and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where passengers forced down a fourth aircraft believed to have been headed to the U.S. Capitol or White House.
The president's appeal for unity comes at a time when political divisions over the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine mandates, and voting and abortion rights, are boiling over across the country.
Hate crimes against Arab-Americans, Muslims and others perceived as Arab or Muslim surged after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and while they have abated in recent years, the numbers have never returned to levels seen before the attacks, FBI data show.
More recently, the United States has seen a rise in anti-Semitic and anti-Asian discrimination and hate crimes.",2021-09-11T00:00:00Z,2021,3,23

SANTAQUIN — With the delta variant raging across the country, Utah families are facing difficult decisions at the start of a new school year. One Santaquin mother said wearing a mask is ultimately about community and looking out for your friends — lessons she hopes her children will learn.
Ashley Nguyen is a mother to three and an 11th grade English teacher. She was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis 10 years ago.
""I'm on a medication that basically suppresses my immune system so that it doesn't attack my joints,"" she explained, which also makes it easier for her to get sick.
Without her medications? ""It makes it hard to pick up my children … I flare up in my feet; I flare up in my knees; I flare up in my wrists,"" she described. ""I remember going out to check the mail and my neighbor being like, 'Oh my gosh, what's wrong with you? What happened?'""
She said it changes the way she moves and interacts with the world.
If Nguyen were to get COVID-19, she would have to go off her medication to recover. Her situation has forced her to make decisions she's never before considered.
""I was really excited to send him back to school this year,"" she said about her second grader, Ezra Nguyen. But now, without a school mask mandate, she's chosen to not send him to school in person.
Nguyen also won't be back in her classroom this year — a heartbreaking decision. ""I was gonna teach this year, that was the plan,"" she said. ""I would have more tears to cry if I hadn't cried them all already.""
""I don't think that this is right for my family to expose myself to this situation,"" she explained. ""I think the hardest part though, is having to choose between my child's mental, emotional, social health and my own physical health like that. That is a difficult decision to make.""
Though Nguyen has been vaccinated against COVID-19, she can't risk being exposed to the virus.
Dr. Per Gesteland, a hospitalist with University of Utah Health and Intermountain Primary Children's Hospital, said nearly 3% of our population is immunocompromised according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""It puts them in a tough position making decisions about their safety and the safety of their families,"" he said.
Gesteland said people may be immunocompromised for several reasons, including those who might have a cancerous tumor, a hematologic malignancy of blood cancer, or an autoimmune condition that requires immunomodulating medications, along with those with HIV or organ donors and recipients.
Gesteland said there are a lot of people in a tough spot when it comes to COVID-19.
""There are immunocompromised people out there that don't have the luxury of being protected by the vaccine like the rest of us,"" he explained. ""Those patients don't have the same kind of response to those vaccinations. In some cases, they may not get much of an antibody response at all; or in ideal circumstances, even blunted, you know, 10 to 20 to 30 percent from what would be expected in an otherwise healthy person.""
He also said immunocompromised patients are at a higher risk for having severe COVID-19 disease, prolonged illness, and can shed the virus longer.
It's families like Nguyen's that have doctors asking people to still be diligent and protect those around them.
""We really should be changing our behaviors, getting vaccinated if you're eligible — (and) if not, wearing a mask in those circumstances — so that we can protect not only those children, but the people that may be vulnerable to that, including the adults in those classrooms,"" Gesteland urged.
""The spread of COVID in our schools is inevitable,"" he said. ""We're going to open up the schools (and) cases are going to start popping up… we're gonna see that those infections inevitably spread to anybody who's susceptible.""
We should let our children know that wearing a mask is about loving their friends.
–Ashley Nguyen
Nguyen hoped people will consider what is best for everyone in the community. ""We need to be looking at our friends, kids and our neighbor's kids, and really be thinking about all of them,"" she said. ""I imagine community as a place where everyone is looking out for each other.""
Gesteland believes parents must lead by example for their children. ""It has to come from the heart, from that parent. And if the parent isn't behind it, then it's going to be hard to get the kids on board,"" he said.
He suggested parents explain the delta variant is more contagious to their children, warranting the use of masks in school to protect their friends and their friends' families. ""Think about the world they live in and how to take care of our fellow citizens and keep each other safe and keep each other healthy,"" Gesteland said.
""We should let our children know that wearing a mask is about loving their friends,"" Nguyen said.
Gesteland said the delta variant is now causing even healthy children to become sicker than previously seen during the pandemic, meaning all the more reason for young children who cannot yet be vaccinated to mask up. Masks can also stop the spread of RSV and Paraflu, which he said are also on the rise.",2021-08-20T00:00:00Z,2021,3,23

Commentary on Pac-12 issues on and off the field …
Rising: Pac-12 visibility
It pays to schedule high-profile games and agree to unusual kickoff times.
Oregon took the risk to play Ohio State in the 'Big Noon Kickoff' window and was rewarded on multiple fronts.
The victory over Ohio State registered a massive 4.25 rating and was seen by 7.7 million viewers — the top-rated game of Week Two and the third-highest of the season.
The Ducks could not have asked for a better outcome. Not only did the high-stakes affair clear a path for the playoff, it boosted recruiting exposure and elevated the program's brand immeasurably.
But that's not the only ratings news of Week Two.
The Washington-Michigan matchup was the second-highest rated game of the week (2.55), followed closely by Colorado-Texas A&M (2.5), according to the website SportsMediaWatch.
Yep, the Pac-12 was involved in the three highest-rated games.
That's believed to be an unprecedented sweep for the conference in the 12-school era. It might be the first time ever, but neither the Hotline nor the conference was able to confirm ratings data going back decades.
The visibility was a positive for the conference but hardly free of hiccups.
Colorado's come-from-ahead loss to the Aggies was low-scoring but at least competitive. On the other hand, Washington did its reputation no favors in the Big House with a listless showing on offense and lopsided defeat.
All in all, the conference's triple-header on broadcast television was seen by 17 million viewers.
So … how do those ratings compare to typical Pac-12 games?
The 7.7 mark for Oregon-Ohio State was matched only once in the three seasons immediately prior to the pandemic. The USC-Notre Dame game late in 2018, with the Irish ranked No. 3 and driving for the playoff, also drew 7.7 million viewers.
Next on the list over those three years: The Utah-Oregon duel in the 2019 conference championship game, which scored a 5.86 rating.
The most popular games in any given Pac-12 season typically draw ratings in the 3s and 4s.
In fact, the Hotline rounded up the audience data for every game in the 2017-19 window and found that only 17 topped the two million-viewer mark.
USC was responsible for seven of the 17, Oregon for five.
Falling: UCLA visibility
At the other end of the audience spectrum, we find UCLA.
The Hotline touched on this matter in the stock report last week, but we're doubling down because the situation, so unfortunate for the Bruins, has been extended.
UCLA was one of the hottest stories in college football after thumping LSU on Labor Day weekend. Then came a week off, followed by a poor time slot for Saturday: The 10:45 p.m. (Eastern) kickoff on the Pac-12 Networks (against Fresno State).
And now we learn the next game, at Stanford on Sept. 25, is also on the Pac-12 Networks.
That's three consecutive post-LSU weeks in which the 13th-ranked Bruins are off the national radar.
Can you image a top-15 team from the Big Ten or SEC going back-to-back games with a total possible audience of 28 million?
It would never happen.
In fact, it couldn't happen, because of the wide reach of those conference's network partners. (The Pac-12 Networks have approximately 14 million subscribers. That's about one-fourth the audience of ESPNU, for example.)
But relief is on the way. The Bruins should return to a high-visibility network on the first Saturday of October when they host No. 19 Arizona State.
If that game also ends up on the Pac-12 Networks … eh, let's not even go there.
Rising: USC's hope
The Trojans gave Clay Helton every resource and opportunity imaginable to patch the holes in his program.
Helton's inability to execute is further evidence that schematic issues can be solved by changing coordinators, but problems with culture, accountability, discipline and toughness can only be fixed with a change at the top.
We cannot help but think back to the decision to retain Helton at the end of the 2018 season and the stagnation that resulted: Three wasted years in which USC's reputation and recruiting suffered, allowing Oregon and others to fill the void and undermining the Pac-12 football brand.
Dismissing Helton now gives the Trojans the best chance to salvage the season and identify the optimum replacement.
The only surprise was in the timing of the move. We had been lulled to sleep by the inaction of previous administrations.
Falling: Nick Rolovich's options
The Washington State coach has been roundly criticized for his anti-vaccine stance, most recently by WSU alum, former SportsCenter anchor and current Pac-12 Networks employee Cindy Brunson.
""The fact that he is the highest-paid employee ($3.2 million per year) in the state of Washington at a university that has bent over backward to become a leader in the medical field is beyond my comprehension,"" she told the Seattle Times.
""I just can't wrap my mind around it, and it's so incredibly frustrating.""
(We commend Brunson for speaking her mind, even at the risk of internal push-back. The Pac-12 Networks are anything but an independent operation: They're owned by, and work for, the schools.)
Perhaps Rolovich will apply for a medical or religious waiver.
Perhaps he plans to get the vaccine in time to meet the Oct. 18 mandate deadline.
Either way, his enduring, immoveable silence is exacerbating the problem for his program and university by an order of magnitude.
And time is short.
Rolovich missed the windows to receive the first Moderna or Pfizer shots and be fully vaccinated by the deadline. To comply with the mandate using Johnson and Johnson, he must act by Oct. 4.
Then again, maybe Rolovich already is vaccinated and would rather have the issue linger than explain himself publicly.
We have no idea, and the lack of transparency is more problematic than the lack of vaccination.

SALT LAKE CITY – Utah Gov. Spencer Cox was in the national spotlight again Thursday, this time joining Washington Post Live to talk about the ""twin crises"" he's juggling while leading the state of Utah: the rising presence of the COVID-19 delta variant and the drought gripping the West.
In the interview, Cox expressed reluctance against enacting any more COVID-19 restrictions as the delta variant spreads — arguing the answer lies instead with vaccines and tackling vaccine hesitancy.
""What steps are we prepared to take?"" Cox said to Frances Stead Sellers, a senior writer for the Washington Post. ""It's to continue to encourage vaccinations, because that's how we stop the spread of this virus.""
Utah currently ranks sixth worse in the nation for the rate of COVID-19 cases as some Utahns continue to be reluctant to get the vaccine. Meanwhile the West's ""megadrought"" has led Cox to issue three executive orders declaring a statewide drought emergency. Most of the state is classified in ""exceptional"" drought — perhaps the worst conditions seen in the state's recorded history.
Cox fielded questions from Stead Sellers about Utah's successes — and mistakes — amid the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as how the state is coming to terms with the drought and the reality of climate change.
For both of these crises, Cox discussed what makes Utah unique: how many Utahns have turned to their faith to grapple with these hard times and what role The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has played.
Why Cox isn't keen on new COVID-19 restrictions
As the delta variant spreads, Stead Sellers asked Cox what ""public health mitigation methods are you prepared to implement should they become necessary with the spread of this virus?""
""This is one area where I think we've all struggled and gotten wrong in a lot of ways,"" Cox said.
The governor added that he wished the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had behavioral scientists working alongside epidemiologists. As he's said before, what's motivated many to get the vaccine is a return to normalcy — and backpedaling on that wouldn't go well with the vaccinated population, Cox said.
""The same types of changes and requirements that we made over the past year are not going to work going forward. They're just not. And they don't have to,"" Cox said, arguing the answer is instead continuing to encourage vaccines.
But Cox also acknowledged the very red state of Utah has its own challenges with vaccine hesitancy.
Related:
Earlier this week, Cox announced the state had reached his goal of administering at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine to 70% of adults. However, the governor said there's still reason for concern as cases and hospitalizations continue to rise and as the highly contagious and likely more virulent delta variant of the coronavirus that was first detected in India spreads rapidly through Utah and the rest of the country.
Cox has pointed out vaccination rates are still below 70% in some parts of the state, including many rural areas and communities of color. While vaccination rates are highest in more liberal areas like Park City and on Salt Lake City's east bench, they're lagging in more conservative areas like Utah County.
The latest Deseret News/Hinckley Institute of Politics poll found that 59% of Republicans in Utah said they were already vaccinated against the virus, compared to 89% of Democrats. A new Washington Post-ABC News poll found nationally, only 45% of Republicans have gotten a shot, compared to 86% of Democrats.
""Republicans are less likely to get vaccinated than Democrats and unaffiliated,"" Cox said pointing to those polls. ""Now, the Republicans in Utah are getting vaccinated at a higher rate than Republicans nationwide, but we are a very red state. A very Republican state. And certainly, in rural Utah where I live, where I grew up and raised my family, those rates are lower.""
Cox said there's ""less trust in the vaccine"" in those areas, so ""trying to overcome those barriers is critical.""
""We're doing everything we can to help take the politics out of — out of the COVID response and certainly out of vaccination,"" the governor said.
How The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints factors in
Asked if Utah's largest church has played a ""strong enough role in helping you get people in Utah vaccinated,"" Cox, who is a Latter-day Saint, said the church has been ""incredibly helpful.""
He noted the church has circulated photographs of church leaders getting the vaccine and issued statements urging church members to ""help quell the pandemic by safeguarding themselves and others through immunization"" because ""vaccinations administered by competent medical professionals protect health and preserve life.""
Cox also noted President Russell M. Nelson is a renowned medical doctor, ""and so he understands explicitly the importance of this vaccine. In fact, he said that this is what we've been praying for, that this is the miracle that we needed and that we've hoped for.""
Cox said church leaders ""explicitly encourage people to get vaccinated. They didn't just say, 'You know, it's up to you, whatever you want to do.' They said, 'We think you should do this, but we recognize that you have that choice,' which is the right answer.""
Asked what he's going to ""challenge"" rural Utah Republicans to get vaccinated, Cox said he's ""going to do just that, and I have done that very explicitly.""
""We know there's only so much we can do, but we're going to do all that we can. We're going to continue to encourage,"" Cox said, adding the state is ""looking at incentives"" and what's worked in other states.
""But I've said all along,"" Cox added, ""I think the best incentive is not dying. I think the best incentive is not being hospitalized.""
Why Cox called on Utahns to 'pray for rain'
Stead Sellars also asked about Cox's recent appeal to all Utahns — regardless of religious affiliation — to pray for rain amid the drought. She asked about ""balancing that scientific message with the religious message.""
""I believe both of those messages are critically important,"" Cox said. ""We have to do our part, and that's why we're working so hard, especially on the conservation message right now.""
Cox said several bills are being drafted with the Utah Legislature to ""improve conservation,"" including looking at removing unnecessary grass in businesses and perhaps churches.
Additionally, Cox said he's ""unabashedly a religious person"" — along with many in Utah.
""Utah's full of religious people who believe in a higher power. And the one thing that we can't control is the weather. ... And so, I've asked that we petition deity,"" Cox said. ""We have a long history of that here in the state of Utah, of governors in times of drought or times of crisis who have asked the citizens to petition deity, whatever you believe in, whatever god you believe in ... that we put those positive energies into one, positive change in ourselves, and then a hope that a higher power can help us through these difficult times.""
How is the drought impacting Utah farmers?
Cox, who himself is a farmer with mainly alfalfa fields in Fairview, Sanpete County, said farmers are ""really struggling the most"" amid the drought.
""Most farmers, including my own farm, we're down about 70% of what we would normally expect for water usage this time of year. Many of us have chosen just not to water,"" he said, adding about half his farm hasn't been watered at all ""so there's no crop production on that.""
The result is a chain reaction on animals that rely on that hay, ""which then impacts, of course, the price of meats and the price of food"" in Utah, across the West, and across the country and parts of the world, he said.
""So that's something we're deeply concerned about. We're working with our partners, working with the Department of Agriculture to make sure that they can survive this year,"" Cox said. They're hoping the drought will recede by next year.
Will Utah increase its water storage?
As a partner in the Colorado River Compact, Cox said Utah has been having ""lots of conversations"" about expanding water storage. In the past, compacts with neighboring Western states have ""served us well,"" but ""unfortunately there's not as much water as planned, and so those negotiations will continue over the next few years as that compact is up for renewal.""
The conversations revolve around ""Can we increase storage capacity?"" Cox said. ""Where will that storage take place? And how will those water rights be affected?""
Cox was also firm that there's ""no question"" and the ""data is very clear"" that climate change is ""playing a role.""
""What we do know is that over the past decade especially we have seen fairly significant warming in the West, and so that is exacerbating these periods of drought that we're now experiencing,"" he said.
That means Utahns and Americans have to ""plan accordingly in multiple ways,"" Cox said. No. 1, ""doing what we can to improve climate change,"" which he called a long-term issue, and No. 2, ""making sure that we're conserving, we're storing water so that we have water for the next five years.""",2021-07-09T00:00:00Z,2021,3,23

UNITED NATIONS — President Joe Biden summoned the world's nations to forcefully address the festering global issues of the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change and human rights abuses in his first address before the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday. He decried military conflict and insisted the U.S. is not seeking ""a new Cold War"" with China.
The president said the halting of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan last month, ending America's longest war, set the table for his administration to shift its attention to intensive diplomacy at a moment with no shortage of crises facing the globe.
""To deliver for our own people, we must also engage deeply with the rest of the world,"" he said.
He added: ""We're opening a new era of relentless diplomacy, of using the power of our development aid to invest in new ways of lifting people up around the world.""
Biden offered a robust endorsement of the U.N.'s relevance and ambition at a difficult moment in history, and sought to reassure wary allies of U.S. cooperation after disagreements in recent months.
He also pledged to double U.S. financial aid to poorer countries to help them switch to cleaner energy and cope with the ""merciless"" effects of climate change. That would mean increasing assistance to about $11.4 billion a year. This after five months ago doubling the amount to $5.7 billion a year.
As part of the fight against climate change, rich nations for many years have promised to spend $100 billion a year in climate help, but a new study shows that they're $20 billion a year short. Biden said his new commitment would help rich nations reach their goal.
The $100 billion goal is key because in climate negotiations there's a dramatic rich-poor nation gap. Developing nations and others are reluctant to curb emissions further of heat-trapping gases without help from developed nations, which in the words of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, are ""the guys that created the problem.""
Biden is facing a healthy measure of skepticism from allies during his week of high-level diplomacy. The opening months of his presidency have included a series of difficult moments with friendly nations that were expecting greater cooperation from Biden following four years of Donald Trump's ""America first"" approach to foreign policy.
Eight months into his presidency, Biden has been out of sync with allies on the chaotic ending to the U.S. war in Afghanistan. He has faced differences over how to go about sharing coronavirus vaccines with the developing world and over pandemic travel restrictions. And there are questions about the best way to respond to military and economic moves by China.
Biden also finds himself in the midst of a fresh diplomatic spat with France, the United States' oldest ally, after announcing plans — along with Britain — to equip Australia with nuclear-powered submarines. The move is expected to give Australia improved capabilities to patrol the Pacific amid growing concern about the Chinese military's increasingly aggressive tactics, but it upended a French defense contract worth at least $66 billion to sell diesel-powered submarines to Australia.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Monday there was a ""crisis of trust"" with the U.S. as a result of the episode.
Biden wasn't so concerned. Asked by a reporter as he arrived at the U.N. on Tuesday how he planned to repair relations with the French, Biden responded with two words: ""They're great.""
Before Biden's arrival in New York, EU Council President Charles Michel on Monday strongly criticized the Biden administration for leaving Europe ""out of the game in the Indo-Pacific region"" and ignoring the underlying elements of the trans-Atlantic alliance — transparency and loyalty — in the withdrawal from Afghanistan and the announcement of the U.S.-U.K.-Australia alliance.
In an interview before his meeting with Biden, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told The Associated Press that he was concerned about the ""completely dysfunctional"" U.S.-China relationship and the possibility it could lead to a new Cold War.
The secretary-general did not back off his concerns about the U.S.-China tensions as he addressed leaders at the opening of Tuesday's gathering. ""It will be impossible to address dramatic economic and development challenges while the world's two largest economies are at odds with each other,"" he said.
Biden sought to play down concerns about China tensions escalating into something more, saying: ""We are not seeking a new Cold War or a world divided into rigid blocs.""
More broadly, he put a heavy emphasis on the need for world leaders to work together on the COVID-19 pandemic, to meet past obligations to address climate change, to head off emerging technology issues and to firm up trade rules.
""We will choose to build a better future. We, you and I, we have the will and capacity to make it better. Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot afford to waste any more time,"" he said. ""We can do this.""
Biden planned to limit his time at the United Nations due to coronavirus concerns. He met with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison in New York following his speech, but was set to shift the rest of the week's diplomacy to virtual and Washington settings.
Morrison and Biden did not comment on the flap with the French when they appeared briefly before the media at the start of their meeting. Morrison, however, praised Biden for understanding the complexities of the situation in the Indo-Pacific.
""There's no doubt you get it,"" the prime minister told Biden.
At a virtual COVID-19 summit Biden is hosting Wednesday, leaders will be urged to step up vaccine-sharing commitments, address oxygen shortages around the globe and deal with other critical pandemic-related issues.
The president was also scheduled to meet with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday at the White House, and invited the prime ministers of Australia, India and Japan — part of a Pacific alliance known as ""the Quad"" — to Washington on Friday. In addition to the gathering of Quad leaders, Biden will sit down for one-on-one meetings with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.
Biden defended his decision to end the U.S. war in Afghanistan, a chaotic withdrawal of American troops that frustrated some allies and hurt his standing at home. He called for the world to make the use of force ""our tool of last resort, not our first"" going forward.
""Today, many of our greatest concerns cannot be solved or even addressed by the force of arms,"" he said. ""Bombs and bullets cannot defend against COVID-19 or its future variants.""

LOS ANGELES — An estimated 2,600 Los Angeles Police Department employees are citing religious objections to try to get out of the required COVID-19 vaccination. In Washington state, thousands of state workers are seeking similar exemptions.
And in Arkansas, a hospital has been swamped with so many such requests from employees that it is apparently calling their bluff.
Religious objections, once used sparingly around the country to get exempted from various required vaccines, are becoming much more widely used against the COVID-19 shot.
And it is only likely to grow following President Joe Biden's sweeping new vaccine mandates covering more than 100 million Americans, including executive branch employees and workers at businesses with more than 100 people on the payroll.
The administration acknowledges that a small minority of Americans will use — and some may seek to exploit — religious exemptions. But it said it believes even marginal improvements in vaccination rates will save lives.
It is not clear how many federal employees have asked for a religious exemption, though union officials say there will be many requests. The Labor Department has said an accommodation can be denied if it causes an undue burden on the employer.
In the states, mask and vaccine requirements vary, but most offer exemptions for certain medical conditions or religious or philosophical objections. The use of such exemptions, particularly by parents on behalf of their schoolchildren, has been growing over the past decade.
The allowance was enshrined in the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, which says employers must make reasonable accommodations for employees who object to work requirements because of ""sincerely held"" religious beliefs.
A religious belief does not have to be recognized by an organized religion, and it can be new, unusual or ""seem illogical or unreasonable to others,"" according to rules laid out by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. But it can't be founded solely on political or social ideas.
That puts employers in the position of determining what is a legitimate religious belief and what is a dodge.
Many major religious denominations have no objections to the COVID-19 vaccines. But the rollout has prompted heated debates because of the longtime role that cell lines derived from fetal tissue have played, directly or indirectly, in the research and development of various vaccines and medicines.
We will not tolerate the abuse of these exemptions by those who simply don't want to get vaccinated. To anyone thinking about filing a disingenuous exemption request, I strongly urge that you reconsider.
–Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti
Roman Catholic leaders in New Orleans and St. Louis went so far as to call Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 shot ""morally compromised."" The company has stressed that there is no fetal tissue in its vaccine.
Moreover, the Vatican's doctrine office has said it is ""morally acceptable"" for Catholics to receive COVID-19 vaccines that are based on research that used cells derived from aborted fetuses. Pope Francis himself has said it would be ""suicide"" not to get the shot, and he has been fully vaccinated with the Pfizer formula.
In New York, state lawmakers have attempted to make the vaccine mandatory for medical workers, with no religious exemptions. On Tuesday, a federal judge blocked the state from enforcing the rule to give a group of workers time to argue that it is illegal because it lacks the opt-out.
Andrew Kurtyko, a registered nurse, is among those who want a religious exemption to not take the vaccine, and he is preparing to leave New York for Florida with his 18-year-old daughter if necessary.
Kurtyko said the ""draconian"" vaccine requirements in the U.S. remind him of communist Poland where he grew up before he and his family immigrated to the United States in 1991. He is a Catholic who believes fetal stem cells were experimented with in making the vaccine. He called Pope Francis' guidance to get vaccinated ""his own opinion.""
""My parents came to this country for better living and crossed the ocean,"" said Kurtyko. ""The least I can do is fight for myself and my family is to go to a different state where religious exemptions are still being honored. ... Our rights are being trampled.""
Across the U.S., public officials, doctors and community leaders have been trying to help people circumvent COVID-19 mask and vaccine requirements.
In Tulsa, Oklahoma, pastor Jackson Lahmeyer is offering a ""religious exemption"" form on his church's website for download, along with links for suggested donations to the church. The 29-year-old is running for the U.S. Senate as a Republican.
Anyone interested can get the form signed by a religious leader, or Lahmeyer can sign it himself if the person joins the church and donates. He said more than 35,000 people downloaded the form in just three days.
""We're not anti-vaxxers. We're just pro-freedom,"" Lahmeyer said. ""A lot of these people who have signed ... have already taken the vaccine. They just don't think it's right that somebody else should be forced or lose their job.""
But obtaining a religious exemption is not as simple as producing a signed form. Measles outbreaks in schools over the past decade prompted some states to change their policies. Some now require an actual signed affidavit from a religious leader, instead of an online form. California got rid of nonmedical exemptions in 2015.
Some employers are taking a hard line. United Airlines told employees last week that those who obtain religious exemptions will be put on unpaid leave until new coronavirus testing procedures are in place.
In Los Angeles, Police Chief Michel Moore said he is waiting for guidance from the city personnel department on how to handle exemption requests. The city has mandated that municipal employees get vaccinated by Oct. 5 unless they are granted a medical or religious exemption. A group of LAPD employees is suing over the policy.
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti had a warning for those seeking exemptions: ""We will not tolerate the abuse of these exemptions by those who simply don't want to get vaccinated. To anyone thinking about filing a disingenuous exemption request, I strongly urge that you reconsider.""
In Washington state, approximately 60,000 state employees are subject to a mandate issued by Gov. Jay Inslee that they be fully vaccinated by Oct. 18 or lose their job, unless they obtain a medical or religious exemption and receive an accommodation that allows them to remain as employees.
As of Tuesday, more than 3,800 workers had requested religious exemptions. So far, 737 have been approved, but officials stressed that an exemption does not guarantee continued employment.
Once the exemption is approved, each agency has to evaluate whether the employee can still do the job with an accommodation while ensuring a safe workplace. Seven accommodations so far have been granted.
Inslee spokeswoman Tara Lee said the process ""may help distinguish between a sincerely held personal belief and a sincerely held religious belief.""
In Arkansas, about 5% of the staff at the privately run Conway Regional Health System has requested religious or medical exemptions.
The hospital responded by sending employees a form that lists a multitude of common medicines — including Tylenol, Pepto-Bismol, Preparation H and Tums — that it said were developed or tested using fetal cell lines.
The form asks people to sign it and attest that ""my sincerely held religious belief is consistent and true and I do not use or will not use"" any of the listed medications.
In a statement, Conway Regional Health President and CEO Matt Troup said: ""Staff who are sincere ... should have no hesitancy with agreeing to the list of medicines listed.""

SALT LAKE CITY — Utah health officials reported 4,657 new COVID-19 cases since Friday, as well as 27 additional deaths.
A breakdown of each day's cases:
- Friday: 1,871
- Saturday: 1,187
- Sunday: 922
- Monday: 707
School-age children accounted for 1,151 of the recent cases — 493 cases were ages 5-10; 290 cases were 11-13; and 368 were 14-18, according to the Utah Department of Health.
The rolling seven-day average for positive tests is 1,382 per day, while the percent positivity rate of those tested stands at 12.6%, following Tuesday's update.
There are 482 people currently hospitalized with the disease in Utah, which is 21 fewer than were hospitalized Friday. Referral intensive care units that can treat the most seriously ill patients are listed as 89% full and overall ICU usage is 86% full, while non-intensive care units across the state are 58% full.
Health care workers have also administered 15,438 additional vaccines since Friday's report, which brings the total vaccinations given in Utah up to 3,296,467. Over the last 28 days, unvaccinated residents face 4.1 times greater risk of dying from COVID-19, 5.9 times greater risk of being hospitalized due to COVID-19 and 5.4 times greater risk of testing positive for COVID-19 than vaccinated people, according to the state health department.
People who are unvaccinated have been at 5.2 times greater risk of dying from COVID-19, 5.2 times greater risk of being hospitalized due to COVID-19, and 4.6 times greater risk of testing positive for COVID-19 than vaccinated people since Feb. 1.
Breakthrough cases in those fully vaccinated accounted for 11,906 cases in Utah, 645 hospitalizations and 64 deaths. Of fully vaccinated residents, about 0.8% have tested positive for COVID-19. Of those vaccinated cases, 0.04% have required hospitalization and 0.004% have died, state data shows.
The latest deaths include:
- A Cache County woman between the ages of 25 and 44, who was hospitalized when she died.
- A Davis County woman, 65-84, hospitalized.
- Two Davis County men, 65-84, hospitalized.

CHICAGO — United Airlines will require employees in the United States to be vaccinated against COVID-19 by late October, perhaps sooner, joining a growing number of big corporations that are responding to a surge in virus cases.
Company leaders called it a matter of safety and cited ""incredibly compelling"" evidence of the effectiveness of the vaccines.
""We know some of you will disagree with this decision to require the vaccine for all United employees,"" CEO Scott Kirby and President Brett Hart told employees Friday. But, they added, ""the facts are crystal clear: everyone is safer when everyone is vaccinated.""
United, which has 67,000 employees in the United States, is the first major U.S. airline to announce it will require vaccination for workers. The airline has been requiring vaccination of new hires since mid-June. Unvaccinated workers are required to wear face masks at company offices.
The Chicago-based airline estimates that up to 90% of its pilots and close to 80% of its flight attendants are already vaccinated. They get incentives to do so.
A United executive said the airline has no plans to require that passengers be vaccinated, calling that a government decision. The CEOs of Delta Air Lines and American Airlines have similarly ruled out a mandate for passengers.
United told U.S. employees Friday that they will need to be fully vaccinated by Oct. 25 or five weeks after the Food and Drug Administration grants full approval to any one vaccine — whichever date comes first. So far, the FDA has only granted emergency-use approval of the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. Full approval of the Pfizer vaccine is expected soon, according to published reports.
Each employee will have to send an image of their vaccine card to the company. Those who don't will be terminated, with exemptions granted only for employees who document religious or medical reasons for not getting the shots, officials said.
Employees who are already vaccinated or do so by Sept. 20 will get an extra day of pay, according to the memo from Kirby and Hart.

The Air Line Pilots Association said in a note to members that a ""small number of pilots"" don't agree with this new policy, but the union believes it is legal. The Association of Flight Attendants encouraged members to get vaccinated and said United's announcement is not surprising because Kirby has spoken in favor of a mandate for several months.
The requirement won't cover employees at smaller airlines that operate United Express flights.
Like United, Delta has operated a vaccination center for employees and recently began requiring the shots for new hires. Delta CEO Ed Bastian said this week that 73% of the airline's workforce is vaccinated. Executives at other airlines have similarly encouraged their workers to get vaccinated, even offering bonuses and paid time off to get the shots, but haven't made them mandatory.
Airlines and other companies in the travel business have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic, which led to sharp travel restrictions.
The United States requires people entering the country, including U.S. citizens, to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test, and the Biden administration plans to require non-U.S. citizens to be vaccinated before entering the country. Some countries require visitors to be vaccinated or test free of the virus to avoid quarantines.
Since the highly contagious delta variant became the leading strain of COVID-19 in the U.S., most airlines have said it hasn't affected ticket sales. However, Frontier Airlines executives on Wednesday blamed the variant for weaker bookings in the past week.
Before the United announcement, Disney and Walmart announced vaccine mandates for white-collar workers, and Microsoft, Google and Facebook said they will require proof of vaccination for employees and visitors to their U.S. offices.
This week, Tyson Foods announced it will require all U.S. employees to get vaccinated by November — notable because, unlike the tech companies, Tyson relies on many lower-paid workers who cannot do their jobs remotely. The president of the United Food and Commercial Workers criticized Tyson for imposing the requirement while the vaccines still have only emergency FDA approval.
A few governments are getting involved. California and New York City will require employees to be vaccinated or face weekly testing, and the California mandate extends to workers in public and private hospitals and nursing homes.
Further, some big companies including Amazon have delayed reopening offices, which will likely push back any significant recovery in lucrative business travel.
The new policies come as the U.S. struggles with a surge in infections. The 7-day average of new reported coronavirus cases has jumped to more than 90,000 a day from around 12,000 a month ago, although hospitalizations and deaths have risen more slowly.",2021-08-06T00:00:00Z,2021,3,23

WASHINGTON — COVID-19 deaths and cases are on the rise again globally in a dispiriting setback that is triggering another round of restrictions and dampening hopes for a return to normal life.
The World Health Organization reported Wednesday that deaths climbed last week after nine straight weeks of decline. It recorded more than 55,000 lives lost, a 3% increase from the week before.
Cases rose 10% last week to nearly 3 million, with the highest numbers recorded in Brazil, India, Indonesia and Britain, WHO said.
The reversal has been attributed to low vaccination rates, the relaxation of mask rules and other precautions, and the swift spread of the more-contagious delta variant, which WHO said has now been identified in 111 countries and is expected to become globally dominant in the coming months.
Sarah McCool, a professor of public health at Georgia State University, said the combination amounts to a ""recipe for a potential tinderbox.""
""It's important that we recognize that COVID has the potential for explosive outbreaks,'' warned Dr. David Dowdy, an infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins University.
Amid the surge, the death toll in hard-hit Argentina surpassed 100,000. Daily coronavirus deaths in Russia hit record highs this week. In Belgium, COVID-19 infections, driven by the delta variant among the young, have almost doubled over the past week. Britain recorded a one-day total of more than 40,000 new cases for the first time in six months.
In Myanmar, crematoriums are working morning to night. In Indonesia, which recorded almost 1,000 deaths and over 54,000 new cases Wednesday, up from around 8,000 cases per day a month ago, people near Jakarta are pitching in to help gravediggers keep up.
""As the diggers are too tired and do not have enough resources to dig, the residents in my neighborhood decided to help,"" Jaya Abidin said. ""Because if we do not do this, we will have to wait in turn a long time for a burial.""
In the U.S., with one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, newly confirmed infections per day have doubled over the past two weeks to an average of about 24,000, though deaths are still on a downward trajectory at around 260 a day.

SALT LAKE CITY — Unmasked and with in-person interviews afterward, Utah football kicked off its first day of fall camp Wednesday. Almost as if nothing unusual happened in 2020.
Whatever the situation, Utah was happy to be back at it for a full season under mostly normal circumstances. With a 92% and climbing team vaccination rate, according to Kyle Whittingham, the team is hoping there will be no disruptions like in 2020 — at least to a major degree.
And like a normal year going into fall camp, the primary focus will be on the quarterback as Utah looks to solidify arguably the most important position on the team.
For Whittingham, this year's team has a 2019 feel to it. But for Utah to sniff any amount of success like its 11-1 regular-season campaign that year, it has to hit a home run on QB1.
The battle, which will come down to veteran signal-caller Charlie Brewer and incumbent starter Cam Rising, will be fierce with two worthy competitors who have developed a strong relationship in the year the two have been together — that's to say nothing of Texas transfer Ja'Quinden Jackson and freshman Peter Costelli who are in the wings playing the backup role.
Rising, who is now in his third year with the program, is coming off a shoulder injury sustained in the first quarter against USC last season and has only one quarter of starting experience after winning the job over Jake Bentley. Whittingham, though, said Rising is 100% and cleared for all competition. Rising also knows the system better than anyone in the quarterback room.
The sophomore QB joked Wednesday there isn't much of offensive coordinator Andy Ludwig's playbook that he doesn't know. ""I'm sure there's little nooks and crannies that I haven't been exposed to yet, but for the most part, I think I've got a good idea of it all.""
Knowing the playbook is half the battle, but Rising has been here before and has already claimed the starting position, though the competition is more stiff this year against a quarterback with a proven record. But from Rising's standpoint, his past injury shouldn't limit him in his ability to win the starting job.
""He looked great today — looked like his old self,"" Whittingham said. ""And I detected no lack of arm strength. He took every rep that he was supposed to take and said he felt great.""
That's good news for Rising and for Utah, who has one of its deepest and most talented quarterback rooms in Whittingham's tenure. And while the job won't be decided on the first day of camp, it's a good start to the rest of the season.
Despite Rising being the incumbent starter and it being his job to lose, Brewer is the perceived favorite to win the job. He has 9,700 career passing yards under his belt and he's orchestrated a Baylor team to a top-10 ranking and near College Football Playoff appearance in 2019. For Brewer, though, it's about learning a new system after four years at Baylor.
Brewer had a strong showing in spring, which gives him an early jumpstart to the season. But whether that will translate into being named QB1 remains to be seen. There's knowing the playbook and executing the plays at a high level. His past experience should indicate an ability to pick up a system well, but will it be as the starter or in a backup role to Rising?
""I watched him play when I was at Texas,"" Rising said. ""He's a great player. He does some very good things and just taking little pieces that he does well and applying it to my game, that's pretty much what he's been able to do.""
The 1st #CampKyle update of the season and it's a relief that's it's all in person.
— Josh Furlong (@JFurKSL) August 5, 2021
Kyle Whittingham said roughly 92% of the players here are vaccinated. A few more are waiting to be ""fully vaccinated.""
Brewer hasn't been in a quarterback battle since his freshman season, but he gave up his role at Baylor because he felt Utah was a place he could win.
""I just thought it was a really good situation and a really good team — a team that's gonna win,"" he said. ""I wanted to be a part of a winning team. I thought the coaching staff was really good, so I'm glad I made the decision, for sure.
""Great football teams have competition everywhere, and that's the make of a championship team — having competition everywhere,"" Brewer added. ""You've just got to go out and compete, just worry about yourself, do as well as you can, keep improving each day, and that's all you can do really.""
The two know what's at stake. Competition breads better athletes.
QB1 will be Utah's best option, and the early signs are Utah is in a good spot to have a successful season with a quarterback room up to the challenge.
""Every day you're just going in to compete and making sure that you're as good as you can for the team; that's pretty much how it is,"" Rising said. ""We're competing against each other for that No. 1 spot, but it's all about the team at the end of the day.""
Notes from Day 1 of #CampKyle
- Defensive end Maxs Tupai is not on the roster and will not be with the team this season. Whittingham did not elaborate on why Tupai will not be with the team, but freshmen Xavier Carlton and Van Fillinger are expected to fill that role. Miki Suguturaga is another candidate for playing time at defensive end.
- Whittingham is ready for a running back by committee approach — at least until someone breaks away from the rest and claims the No. 1 spot. That could be midway through the season or during fall camp; but at least on the first day of fall camp, the competition is on equal footing for Micah Bernard, TJ Pledger, Chris Curry and Tavion Thomas.
- Ben Renfro and Caine Savage, who spent some time on offense in spring, will move back to defense in fall. Renfro will workout with the safeties and Savage with the cornerbacks.
- At the safety position opposite Vonte Davis, freshman Cole Bishop has taken a leading role. Whittingham singled him out as a starting-caliber player, with Washington transfer Brandon McKinney and Kamo'i Latu in the mix.",2021-08-05T00:00:00Z,2021,3,23

MURRAY — Doctors in Utah and across the region fear the current surge of COVID-19 could overwhelm our hospitals.
Dr. Eddie Stenehjem, an infectious diseases doctor at Intermountain Healthcare, said the data shows the rise in case counts is being driven by children.
He recommended a return to the pandemic basics to stop the surge.
""We're going to have to pivot back to that, especially in those children that are unable to get the vaccine,"" said Stenehjem. ""We know what works. It's a matter of making sure that we can implement that.""
Utah hospitals are effectively full. They don't have the staffing to add more beds. They've also had to turn down requests for help from out-of-state hospitals, which are in worse shape.
""My biggest concern right now is… yes, it's with the people that are in the hospital that are struggling in the ICU, those adults,"" said Stenehjem. ""But, I'm also very concerned about our children and what's going to happen in the next coming weeks.""
Stenehjem said COVID-19 hospitalizations among children are rising nationally.
""I suspect we will see that occur here in Utah, as well, and if we continue to see this rise in kids getting infected, we're going to see higher hospitalizations,"" he said. ""We're going to see spillover from children into adults, and that's going to further complicate our challenges in the hospitals, as well.""
To stop the surge, Stenehjem said, ""Immediately, we need to pivot to public health measures by wearing masks in classrooms, in order to keep kids in school. What I worry is going to happen is we're going to have significant outbreaks in schools, which is going to lead to schools shutting down.""
Hospitals in northern Idaho went into crisis standards of care Tuesday because their system has been overwhelmed, and they do not have adequate resources to provide regular care.
""That's something we want to avoid at all costs, if it all possible,"" said Stenehjem.
It's a problem facing hospitals across the country. Health care workers are the No. 1 shortage.
""We don't have health care workers that we can pull from other parts of the country because they're having challenges staffing their own hospitals,"" said Stenehjem.
Utah hospitals, he said, are getting multiple requests from multiple states. They want to know if Utah hospitals can take their COVID-19 patients.
We know what works. It's a matter of making sure that we can implement that.
–Dr. Eddie Stenehjem, an infectious diseases doctor at Intermountain Healthcare
""Over the weekend, we had to deny 10 transfer requests from out of state, other people looking to place patients in our facilities, and we've had to deny 10 of those.""
Slowing transmission of the virus will ease the burden on hospitals, said Stenehjem, so he recommended getting vaccinated.
If you're not vaccinated, he said to mask up and social distance in order to stop the spread.",2021-09-08T00:00:00Z,2021,3,23

SALT LAKE CITY — A recent report from the Public Religion Research Institute says 53% of Americans agree with the statement: ""Because getting vaccinated against COVID-19 helps protect everyone, it is a way to live out the religious principle of loving my neighbors.""
Some religious leaders have cited their faith as a reason to promote vaccination, like doctrinal mandates to love others or to stay as healthy as possible. Others have cited their faith as a reason to allow others to make the medical decisions themselves without getting involved. Some have even cited their faith as a reason to discourage vaccination.
So what exactly are official religious beliefs surrounding immunization? Which religions and faith traditions are doctrinally opposed to vaccination? And do these beliefs also apply to the COVID-19 vaccine?
Prominent religious leaders like the pope, the dalai lama, the archbishop of Canterbury, the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, the leadership of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and many others have been vaccinated, often documenting it publicly.
What does The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints say?
In Utah, many religious leaders across all faiths have made efforts to promote the vaccine by hosting vaccine clinics or addressing the issue over the pulpit.
The most prominent church in Utah, the Church of Jesus Christ, has repeatedly encouraged its members to get vaccinated, even updating its official policy handbook to encourage vaccinations.
Latter-day Saint church leadership has been vaccinated, and President Russell M. Nelson called the vaccine a ""literal godsend.""
Though ultimately, the official policy says the decision is up to the members, with divine guidance. And the Public Religion Research Institute report showed that 17% of Latter-day Saints say they will not get vaccinated.
""Among the religious groups least receptive to the vaccines, white evangelical Protestants stand out as the most likely to say they will refuse to get vaccinated (26%), with an additional 28% who are hesitant,"" the report published in April states. ""About 1 in 5 other Protestants of color (20%), Black Protestants (19%), and Mormons (17%) say they will not get vaccinated, and another one-third of each are hesitant (35%, 32% and 33%, respectively).""
No churches officially oppose vaccinations in general, and very few openly discourage them. The two most common religions referenced in legal vaccination exemptions for schools are the Dutch Reformed Church and the Church of Christ, Scientist.
Dutch Reformed Church
Though it is not an official church stance, many members opt out of vaccination because they believe that vaccines can interfere with their relationship with God by making them less dependent. The church has not made a specific statement about the COVID-19 vaccine.
The Church of Christ, Scientist
The church does not have an official policy about vaccination, and it relies on members to make decisions for themselves following the golden rule. However, founder Mary Baker Eddy did recommend members follow what the law requires. Federal or state laws do not require COVID-19 vaccinations. Christian scientists believe in faith healing through prayer, meaning that they believe prayer has the ability to cure diseases and illnesses. Many members choose to turn down vaccinations in order to rely solely on prayer and faith for treatment.
Other faith healing denominations include Faith Tabernacle, Church of the First Born, Faith Assembly and End Time Ministries.
There are some doctrinal issues in other religions, depending on the vaccine in question. Here are some of the common religious reasons people turn down vaccines.
Animal-based vaccine ingredients
Islam
Beliefs about vaccination vary among Islamic sects and individuals.
The main religious concern is if the vaccine contains porcine ingredients, like pork gelatin, which is a common ingredient among vaccines. Consumption of pork is considered ""haram,"" or forbidden under Islamic law. Most Islamic leaders and councils agree that vaccination does not qualify as ingesting pork and are ""halal,"" or permissible.
The COVID-19 vaccine does not include any porcine or animal products, but widespread misinformation has made many Muslims wary about getting vaccinated.
In the early months of the pandemic, vaccine rates among Muslims were some of the lowest in the nation, but many imams and other religious and community leaders have launched outreach programs through mosques and cultural organizations to promote vaccination. Some have made rules that unvaccinated people may not be allowed to enter mosques.
One imam from the Islamic Center of Virginia in Richmond told WebMD that Muslim doctrine supports vaccination. ""We have a religious duty and obligation to be vaccinated as long as competent science and medical authorities approve the vaccine,"" Imam Ammar Amonette said.
Judaism
In Judaism, vaccination is not just encouraged; it's required by Jewish law as part of a mandate for members to take care of their bodies. However, there are some concerns that some vaccines that contain animal gelatin products are not kosher, meaning that they don't follow the requirements for Jewish law related to food. However, many prominent Jewish religious leaders have said that vaccine injections do not count as ingesting the animal products.
There has also been a large amount of misinformation spread that the COVID-19 vaccines are not kosher, but the vaccines don't contain animal products. Jewish doctors and religious leaders have done much to combat this misinformation. Israel even launched a largely successful campaign to correct false claims that specifically targeted ultra-Orthodox Jews and encouraged vaccination.
Hinduism
In Hinduism, practitioners believe that divinity is in all things, including plants and animals. Cows are considered particularly sacred. Some vaccines contain bovine gelatin, which may concern some Hindus. However, many Hindu leaders have stated that the overall benefit of keeping people healthy and safe takes precedence.
Jehovah's Witnesses
Prior to 1952, Jehovah's Witness leadership instructed practitioners not to receive vaccinations because one leader believed vaccines used animal blood cells. The faith does not permit blood transfusions or donations, but since it was made clear that vaccines did not involve blood contact, Witnesses have been permitted to be vaccinated.
Fetal cell lines and abortion
Many vaccines use fetal cell lines that are grown in a lab, but those cell lines descend from cells taken from two fetuses from elective abortions in the 1970s and 1980s. Those original cells have been multiplied in labs for decades, meaning that they are far removed from the original fetal tissue. Fetal cell lines don't contain any tissue from the original aborted fetuses. However, many people who are religiously opposed to abortion are hesitant to use cells that are in any way connected to abortion. This is a particularly common belief within Christian sects.
Neither Pfizer nor Moderna used fetal cell lines in the development of their COVID-19 vaccines, and none of the COVID-19 vaccines use fetal cell lines from recent abortions.
Catholicism
Some members of the Catholic Church turn down vaccines that contain cell lines derived from aborted fetal tissue based on the belief that life begins at conception and that they would be morally complicit in the abortions. However, the Catholic Church has officially stated that clinically safe and effective vaccines ""can be used in good conscience"" because ""the use of such vaccines does not constitute formal cooperation with the abortion"" and, in fact, becoming vaccinated can be seen as protecting personal health and pursuing the common good.
The Vatican's doctrinal office, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, released a statement explaining that the Pfizer and Moderna medicine were not developed from the cell lines in question, though they may have been tested on them. They classified these vaccines as ""ethically sound."" AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson were developed from those cell lines, but the Catholic Church states that receiving those vaccines is still ""morally acceptable"" and that recipients are doing good by preventing disease and saving lives, including those of unborn babies who might not make it to term if the mothers get COVID-19.
Pope Francis has received the COVID-19 vaccine and has stated that everyone is morally obligated to get the vaccine.
""It is the moral choice because it is about your life but also the lives of others,"" he told an Italian news program in January.
God's will and fatalism
Amish
Amish communities have been hit particularly hard by diseases because of some hesitancy to be vaccinated. Most Amish people object to vaccination because of political or personal reasons rather than religious reasons. They don't have any official religious beliefs against vaccination; however, a core tenet of their faith is accepting God's will. That means that if someone falls ill and dies, it was God's will that they do so. If they are saved, that was also God's will.
COVID-19 in particular has drastically affected Amish communities; and because of low vaccination rates, the variants have taken and continue to take a severe toll on the Amish people.
Fundamentalists
Many fundamentalist religions, such as the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, have unofficial fatalist beliefs similar to the Amish — what happens is God's will, whether that's life or death. Because of these beliefs, members of fundamentalist faiths tend not to get vaccinated.
Incorporating faith into vaccination
Buddhism and Sikhism do not have any doctrine opposing vaccination and are generally encouraging practitioners to get it.
Some religions have even found a way to incorporate their beliefs into the vaccination, combining prayer or religious ceremonies, like Christian Scientists using faith healing to recover from the potential side effects or traditional healers in the Navajo Nation who use a prayer object in a protection ceremony before being vaccinated.
The conclusion of the report on the COVID-19 vaccine and religion was that 1 in 4 Americans who are hesitant to get the vaccine report that faith-based encouraging of vaccination would make them more likely to get vaccinated.",2021-07-31T00:00:00Z,2021,3,23

SALT LAKE CITY — The number of hospitalized Utah COVID-19 patients soared to 293 Tuesday as the state continues to deal with a spike in the disease.
Utah's number of COVID-19 cases increased by 559 on Tuesday, with four more deaths and 5,720 vaccinations reported, according to the Utah Department of Health.
The rolling seven-day average number of positive cases per day is now at 583, according to the health department. The positive test rate per day for that time period calculated with the ""people over people"" method is now 13.5%. The positive test rate per day for that time period calculated with the ""test over test"" method is now 9.3%.
Of the 293 COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized Tuesday, 123 are in intensive care units, according to health department data. More than 100 COVID-19 patients have been in ICUs every day for the past week.
As of Tuesday, about 74% of Utah's ICU hospital beds are occupied, including about 78% of the ICU beds in the state's 16 referral hospitals. Those capacity numbers indicate that there is a major strain on the Utah health care system. About 57% of the state's non-ICU hospital beds are now occupied.
A total of 2,956,857 vaccines have been administered in the state, up from 2,951,137 Monday. About 50.9% of Utah's total population — or 1,630,778 residents — has now received at least a first dose of the vaccine, according to the health department. About 45.3% of the population — or 1,453,516 Utahns — is now fully vaccinated. Among Utahns ages 12 and older, who are currently eligible for the vaccine, 62.9% have received at least a first dose and 56.1% are fully vaccinated.
Of the 2,867,449 people tested for COVID-19 in Utah so far, 14.8% have tested positive for COVID-19. A total of 5,227,339 COVID-19 tests have now been conducted in Utah since the pandemic began, up 7,712 since Monday, according to the health department. Of those, 4,457 were tests of people who hadn't previously been tested for COVID-19.
The four deaths reported Tuesday were:
- A Davis County man over the age of 85 who was hospitalized when he died.
- A Salt Lake County man between the ages of 45 and 64 who was not hospitalized when he died.
- A Utah County woman, 45-64, who was a resident of a long-term care facility.
- A Weber County woman between 65 and 84 who was hospitalized when she died.
Tuesday's totals give Utah 424,730 total confirmed cases, with 18,170 total hospitalizations and 2,420 total deaths from the disease.

WASHINGTON — Pfizer said Monday its COVID-19 vaccine works for children ages 5 to 11 and that it will seek U.S. authorization for this age group soon — a key step toward beginning vaccinations for youngsters.
The vaccine made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech already is available for anyone 12 and older. But with kids now back in school and the extra-contagious delta variant causing a huge jump in pediatric infections, many parents are anxiously awaiting vaccinations for their younger children.
For elementary school-aged kids, Pfizer tested a much lower dose — a third of the amount that's in each shot given now. Yet after their second dose, children ages 5 to 11 developed coronavirus-fighting antibody levels just as strong as teenagers and young adults, Dr. Bill Gruber, a Pfizer senior vice president, told The Associated Press.
The kid dosage also proved safe, with similar or fewer temporary side effects — such as sore arms, fever or achiness — that teens experience, he said.
""I think we really hit the sweet spot,"" said Gruber, who's also a pediatrician.
Gruber said the companies aim to apply to the Food and Drug Administration by the end of the month for emergency use in this age group, followed shortly afterward with applications to European and British regulators.
Earlier this month, FDA chief Dr. Peter Marks told the AP that once Pfizer turns over its study results, his agency would evaluate the data ""hopefully in a matter of weeks"" to decide if the shots are safe and effective enough for younger kids.
Many Western countries so far have vaccinated no younger than age 12, awaiting evidence of what's the right dose and that it works safely in smaller tots. But Cuba last week began immunizing children as young as 2 with its homegrown vaccines and Chinese regulators have cleared two of its brands down to age 3.
While kids are at lower risk of severe illness or death than older people, more than 5 million children in the U.S. have tested positive for COVID-19 since the pandemic began and at least 460 have died, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Cases in children have risen dramatically as the delta variant swept through the country.
""I feel a great sense of urgency"" in making the vaccine available to children under 12, Gruber said. ""There's pent-up demand for parents to be able to have their children returned to a normal life.""
There's pent-up demand for parents to be able to have their children returned to a normal life.
–Dr. Bill Gruber, Pfizer senior vice president
In New Jersey, 10-year-old Maya Huber asked why she couldn't get vaccinated like her parents and both teen brothers have. Her mother, Dr. Nisha Gandhi, a critical care physician at Englewood Hospital, enrolled Maya in the Pfizer study at Rutgers University. But the family hasn't eased up on their masking and other virus precautions until they learn if Maya received the real vaccine or a dummy shot.
Once she knows she's protected, Maya's first goal: ""a huge sleepover with all my friends.""
Maya said it was exciting to be part of the study even though she was ""super scared"" about getting jabbed. But ""after you get it, at least you feel like happy that you did it and relieved that it didn't hurt,"" she told the AP.
Pfizer said it studied the lower dose in 2,268 kindergartners and elementary school-aged kids. The FDA required what is called an immune ""bridging"" study: evidence that the younger children developed antibody levels already proven to be protective in teens and adults. That's what Pfizer reported Monday in a press release, not a scientific publication. The study still is ongoing, and there haven't yet been enough COVID-19 cases to compare rates between the vaccinated and those given a placebo — something that might offer additional evidence.
The study isn't large enough to detect any extremely rare side effects, such as the heart inflammation that sometimes occurs after the second dose, mostly in young men. The FDA's Marks said the pediatric studies should be large enough to rule out any higher risk to young children. Pfizer's Gruber said once the vaccine is authorized for younger children, they'll be carefully monitored for rare risks just like everyone else.
A second U.S. vaccine maker, Moderna, also is studying its shots in elementary school-aged children. Pfizer and Moderna are studying even younger tots as well, down to 6-month-olds. Results are expected later in the year.

WASHINGTON — The United States will not lift any existing travel restrictions ""at this point"" due to concerns over the highly transmissible COVID-19 delta variant and the rising number of U.S. coronavirus cases, a White House official told Reuters.
The decision, which comes after a senior-level White House meeting late Friday, means the long-running travel restrictions that have barred much of the world's population from the United States since 2020 will not be lifted in the short term.
""Given where we are today with the delta variant, the United States will maintain existing travel restrictions at this point,"" the official told Reuters, citing the spread of the delta variant in the United States and abroad.
""Driven by the delta variant, cases are rising here at home, particularly among those who are unvaccinated and appear likely to continue to increase in the weeks ahead.""
The announcement almost certainly dooms any bid by U.S. airlines and the U.S. tourism industry to salvage summer travel by Europeans and others covered by the restrictions. Airlines have heavily lobbied the White House for months to lift the restrictions.
The United States currently bars most non-U.S. citizens who within the last 14 days have been in the United Kingdom, the 26 Schengen nations in Europe without border controls, Ireland, China, India, South Africa, Iran and Brazil.
The extraordinary U.S. travel restrictions were first imposed on China in January 2020 to address the spread of COVID-19 and other countries have been added since then — most recently India in early May.
Last week, the U.S. Homeland Security Department said U.S. land borders with Canada and Mexico will remain closed to non-essential travel until at least Aug. 21 — even as Canada said it would begin allowing in fully vaccinated American tourists starting Aug. 9.
We rely on public health and medical advice on when we're going to determine changes to be made.
–Jen Psaki, White House spokesperson
Asked on July 15 at a joint appearance with German Chancellor Angela Merkel about when the United States would lift European travel restrictions, Biden said he would ""be able to answer that question to you within the next several days — what is likely to happen.""
Merkel said any decision to lift restrictions ""has to be a sustainable decision. It is certainly not sensible to have to take it back after only a few days.""
Since that press conference, U.S. cases have jumped.
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Rochelle Walensky said Thursday the seven-day average of new cases in the United States was up 53% over the previous week. The delta variant, which was first found in India, now comprises more than 83% of new cases nationwide and has been detected in more than 90 countries.
The White House official also cited the fact that last week, the CDC urged Americans to avoid travel to the United Kingdom, given a jump in cases.
But the official added: ""The administration understands the importance of international travel and is united in wanting to reopen international travel in a safe and sustainable manner.""
The restrictions have brought heavy criticism from people prevented from seeing loved ones.

White House spokesperson Jen Psaki on Friday said international travel is ""something we would all like to see — not just for tourism, but for families to be reunited.""
But Psaki added, ""we rely on public health and medical advice on when we're going to determine changes to be made.""
The Biden administration has refused to offer any metrics that would trigger when it will unwind restrictions and has not disclosed if it will remove restrictions on individual countries or focus on enhancing individual traveler scrutiny.
Reuters reported last week the White House was discussing the potential of mandating COVID-19 vaccines for international visitors, but no decisions have been made, the sources said.
The Biden administration has also been talking to U.S. airlines in recent weeks about establishing international contact tracing for passengers before lifting travel restrictions.
The White House in early June launched interagency working groups with the European Union, Britain, Canada, and Mexico to look at how eventually to lift travel and border restrictions.
In January, the CDC imposed mandatory COVID-19 testing requirements for nearly all international air travelers.

SALT LAKE CITY — With COVID-19 cases surging in Utah, has the time come for the fully vaccinated to get booster shots?
Pfizer and its partner company in producing one of the three coronavirus vaccines approved for use in the United States, Bio-Tech, announced a new study Thursday showing promising results from administering a third shot, six months after the first two, and expect to submit their findings to federal authorities for authorization.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration responded in a joint statement, ""Americans who have been fully vaccinated do not need a booster shot at this time,"" but said the issue is being studied and the recommendation could change.
""We are prepared for booster doses if and when the science demonstrates that they are needed,"" the statement said. Someone is considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their final dose of vaccine — two shots for Pfizer or Moderna, and one for Johnson & Johnson.
Utah health care experts also are saying not yet, although they acknowledge there's increasing interest, especially among those who received the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine, in securing more protection against the highly contagious delta variant of the virus first detected in India now dominant in Utah and the rest of the country.
""This one's a tricky one,"" said Dr. Michelle Hofmann, deputy director of the Utah Department of Health, calling a question about additional shots raised during a recent virtual news conference to encourage vaccinations ""on the cutting-edge of where we may be going.""
Some countries are already allowing a different type vaccine to be given as a second dose following one that's similar in makeup to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The J&J shot is less effective against the original coronavirus, with about 60% efficacy compared to 95% for Pfizer and Moderna.
All three vaccines largely prevent hospitalization and death in the fully vaccinated, but how much their performance declines against the delta variant is now an issue. Studies have shown both doses of Pfizer — and likely Moderna, which uses the same new technology — are needed, but there's little data on Johnson & Johnson.
Related:
The CDC's official policy is that vaccines are not interchangeable, although the National Institutes of Health announced in June a clinical trial was underway to determine the safety and effectiveness of giving booster doses of different COVID-19 vaccines to fully vaccinated adults.
""We do not recommend that currently in the United States,"" Hofmann said, citing potential safety concerns. ""We are starting to hear of individuals with an interest, and wondering about that, but that is not currently a recommendation,""
Still, not everyone is willing to wait. Hofmann was responding to a question posted on Facebook from a woman who said she knows ""several people who received the J&J vaccine who have gone and got a second dose of either Moderna or Pfizer. Is this recommended or safe or necessary?""
There are multiple media reports of people who'd gotten the Johnson & Johnson vaccine but then surreptitiously sought out Pfizer shots in the hope the higher efficacy associated with the new type of vaccine will make them less likely to experience a breakthrough case of COVID-19.
A few, including Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization, are experts in the field. Rasmussen, an American working in Canada, tweeted in late June she'd gotten a Pfizer shot ""to top off the J&J vaccine I received in April"" and felt fine.
""I think I did the right thing to make sure I am as protected as possible from the delta variant and thus am protecting others who only have one shot,"" she said in her much-viewed Twitter thread, adding ""Sometimes public health requires making tough decisions without a complete data set to support it.""

Shortly before the July 4th holiday, the region's largest health care provider, Intermountain Healthcare, told vaccinated patients in a blog post it's too soon to roll up their sleeves for another dose because, ""So far, the signs are good that we won't need booster shots any time soon.""
The post said federal agencies are assessing the risk of additional shots by looking at various factors including whether breakthrough cases in the fully vaccinated are going up, if booster doses or combining different types of vaccines provides more protection, and if the variants are harder to fight.
Just how long it will take to make that determination remains to be seen, said Dr. Tamara Sheffield, medical director of preventive medicine at Intermountain Healthcare. That could come sooner rather than later once more is known about the effectiveness of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine against the delta variant.
""At this point, we don't have anything that tells us we should do it yet. But that could change quickly,"" Sheffield said. In the meantime, she offered some advice for Utahns who got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine — less than 130,000 compared to almost 1.5 million in the state who received Pfizer or Moderna.
""I tend to be someone who's more cautious,"" she said. ""I would say to anyone who may wonder if they're fully protected to follow careful gathering behaviors. If you're indoors with a group of individuals who may not be vaccinated, then people should mask up.""
Han Kim, a professor of public health at Westminster College in Salt Lake City, said data about the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is hard to come by because relatively few people got the single shot, adding ""it might not be a bad idea to get a booster.""
A decision from the federal government about such shots may come closer to fall, Kim said, when COVID-19 cases could surge even higher as students, especially those under 12 years old who aren't eligible for the vaccine, return to classrooms and people spend more time indoors as temperatures drop.
We should be focused on getting people, in fact, their first shot, much less a third shot.
–Han Kim, professor of public health, Westminster College
Pfizer's announcement about booster shots is raising questions, he said.
""There's a lot of chatter amongst epidemiologists and public health folks that this is completely unnecessary,"" Kim said, noting the vaccine is expected to remain ""pretty effective"" for at least a year and shots only started last December and became widely available months later.
""We live in a world where there is a huge amount of injustice in terms of vaccine distribution and we're going to start prioritizing a third shot for Americans, in a country that is still struggling to achieve 70% of the adult population with one shot? A lot of people are saying this is far too premature,"" he said.
Gov. Spencer Cox said Utah has reached that 70% goal, if vaccine doses administered by federal agencies in the state are counted. But many parts of the state, including Utah County and rural communities, have much lower vaccination rates and less than 45% of the overall population is fully vaccinated.
""We should be focused on getting people, in fact, their first shot, much less a third shot,"" Kim said. He said not only would delivering a third shot be logistically difficult, it is also being seen by some as ""Pfizer taking advantage of this situation, to push for a third dose.""",2021-07-10T00:00:00Z,2021,3,23

SALT LAKE CITY — When 13-year-old Loïs Merci pictured her baptism, she thought it would be like the ones she had seen before.
But instead of being baptized in a convention center with thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses from around the world in attendance, her father baptized her in an inflatable pool in a family friend's backyard with just a few family members and friends in attendance.
""It was a new experience for me, but I saw my dad and it was kind of normal. There weren't that many people around me, so I wasn't that nervous,"" she said. ""Although it was small, it was still very special.""
She and her father, Amisi Malembo, attend the Swahili congregation in Utah with their family. They are originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo and moved to Utah in 2017.
""I was very happy when my daughter told me that she had made a personal decision to get baptized. It was a wonderful feeling to baptize my daughter personally. I felt like Jehovah was sending a message to give her special care in the new country,"" he said.
Loïs is one of thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses throughout Utah who are attending their second virtual global convention from home, joining with 15 million to 20 million people in 240 countries.
Last year, in-person regional conventions — including the one that has been held at Weber State University's Dee Events Center in Ogden for over 30 years — were canceled because of COVID-19, and instead the church moved the gathering online for the first time over six weekends to help the congregants better process the material.
Substantial effort has been made to make this year's virtual conference spanning weekends in July and August ""the most accessible event in the history of mankind,"" said Robert Hendriks, U.S. spokesman for the denomination.
Typically Witnesses hold 6,000 conventions every year with about 800 here in the United States, and people will travel to conventions from all over the world. The in-person events are usually three days over a weekend ""immersion experience,"" he continued.
Now instead of large baptismal gatherings, Witnesses are opting for intimate baptisms in ponds, lakes, swimming pools, inflatable pools and even bathtubs, with only minimal attendance.
In order to qualify for baptism, candidates must study the Bible, answer questions and make a public declaration of their faith, according to the faith's website. And for Loïs, even though the outward circumstances were different, the internal significance remained the same.
""Dedication to God happens in your heart,"" Hendriks said. ""We pray to Jehovah, and we say we want to dedicate our lives to him, so that's private. But Jesus taught us that we had to make our dedication public,"" which is where baptism comes in, he continued.
He related Loïs' small, intimate experience to that of Jesus' baptism by John the Baptist.
""Our baptisms today during COVID are very much like baptisms in the first century where people were doing it in homes and in the Jordan River and other places where they didn't have 5,000 people watching. And so we're kind of going back to our Christian roots on that. But still, it does take some of the moment away,"" Hendriks said.
The theme for this year's convention is ""Powerful by Faith!"" With the delta variant still spreading, travel being limited and the COVID-19 vaccine not being available in many countries, the convention is all available online for free in 500 languages, 150 of which are sign languages, with descriptions of all the visual components for blind people. The sessions are available for download in every country through the Jehovah's Witness library app, as well as on Roku TV, Apple TV and the JW Broadcasting app.
""Being able to do this virtually is really good because it keeps our families safe. And it also allows them to continue to be with family and to kind of hunker down, focus on their real moment, and not worry about these other things that would have stressed them out if they had to travel,"" Hendriks said.
The virtual convention includes talks, hymns, music videos in a variety of languages and dramatizations of the lives of Biblical figures. It's typical for some of the multimedia elements of each conference to be in the works for five years before they are aired. This year's talks emphasize ways to improve the strength of faith, and one session focuses specifically on the example of women of faith.
The theme was chosen in response to the fear and uncertainty that has come about globally because of the pandemic, during which people have been hit medically, socially, financially and spiritually. Faith is the antidote to the pessimism about the future and the thing that gives people enough hope to get through difficult times, explained Hendriks.
""We're hoping that as a result of this convention, which is focusing on faith, that for those whose faith has waned a bit, it can be rekindled. For those whose faith it has strengthened during this time, that it can be even more strengthened, augmented, and that this pandemic, and this convention together, can give us the opportunity to come out of this whole crisis stronger than the people we came into it as. And that's really our goal,"" he said.
Eventually, Jehovah's Witnesses will go back to their tradition of being the largest convention organization in the world, but they are going to take their time to ensure safety for everyone.
""We're very global and international and we're a brotherhood. So we have to think about the implications of the international aspect of our religion, and not simply look at the implications for places, you know, states or cities, but really a global implication. So we're looking at our options, and we're looking at what's going on in the world and with the pandemic, and we'll be making some decisions over the next several months on next year's conventions,"" he said.",2021-08-09T00:00:00Z,2021,3,23

WASHINGTON — The U.S. moved a step closer Wednesday to offering booster doses of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine to senior citizens and others at high risk from the virus as the Food and Drug Administration signed off on the targeted use of the extra shots.
The FDA authorized booster doses for Americans who are 65 and older, younger people with underlying health conditions and those in jobs that put them at high-risk for COVID-19. The ruling represents a drastically scaled-back version of the Biden administration's sweeping plan to give third doses to nearly all American adults to shore up their protection amid the spread of the highly contagious delta variant.
However, more regulatory hurdles lie ahead before the dispensing of boosters can begin.
Advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention opened a two-day meeting Wednesday to make their own, more specific recommendations about who should get the extra shots and when. And in their first day of discussions, some experts were so perplexed by the questions surrounding the rationale for boosters that they suggested putting off a decision for a month in hopes of more evidence.
The uncertainties were yet another reminder that the science surrounding boosters is more complicated than the Biden administration suggested when the president and his top aides rolled out their plan at the White House last month.
The FDA decision Wednesday was expected after the agency's own panel of advisers last week overwhelmingly rejected the Biden plan. The panel instead recommended boosters only for those most vulnerable to severe cases of COVID-19.
The timing of the FDA decision was highly unusual given that the agency typically takes action before the CDC convenes its own experts.
The CDC panelists heard a series of presentations Wednesday outlining the knotty state of science on boosters. On one hand, the COVID-19 vaccines continue to offer strong protection against severe illness, hospitalization and death. On the other hand, there are signs of more low-grade infections among the vaccinated as immunity wanes.
Ultimately the committee must decide who is considered at high enough risk for an extra dose. Data provided by Pfizer and the Israeli government suggests a strong case for boosters in people 65 and older, but there is less evidence that extra shots provide much benefit for younger people with underlying health conditions.
Several CDC advisers agreed boosters are also important for keeping health care workers on the job.
""We don't have enough health care workers to take care of the unvaccinated,"" said Dr. Helen Talbot of Vanderbilt University. ""They just keep coming.""
The CDC has already said it is considering boosters for older people, nursing home residents and front-line health care workers, rather than all adults.
The World Health Organization and other global health advocates are opposed to wealthy nations dispensing a third round of shots when poor countries don't have enough vaccine for their first doses. And many independent scientists say that the vaccines continue to perform well against the worst effects of COVID-19 and that their ability to curb the overall trajectory of the epidemic is uncertain.
U.S. regulators will decide at a later date on boosters for people who have received the Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccines. If Pfizer boosters are authorized this week, U.S. regulators indicated the shots would not be recommended for people who got a different brand of vaccine initially.
The across-the-board rollout of boosters proposed by the White House was supposed to have begun this week. Some questioned whether President Joe Biden had gotten ahead of the science by announcing his plans before government regulators had reached any conclusions.
Despite the resistance in recent days, some top U.S. health officials said they expect boosters to eventually win broader approval in the coming weeks or months. Dr. Anthony Fauci said over the weekend that ""this is not the end of the story.""
Other administration officials noted that the FDA decision covers tens of millions of Americans and that seniors and other high-risk groups would have been the first to get boosters even if extra shots had been authorized for the entire population. Seniors were in the first group of Americans eligible for vaccination last December.
The U.S. has already authorized third doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for certain people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients and transplant recipients. Other Americans, healthy or not, have managed to get boosters, in some cases simply by asking.
The U.S. is dispensing around 760,000 vaccinations per day on average, down from a high of 3.4 million a day in mid-April. About 180 million Americans are fully vaccinated, or 64% of those who are eligible.

ATLANTA — Common colds share many symptoms of the coronavirus, so if your child becomes ill as the school year gets underway, it might be difficult to immediately tell whether it's COVID-19, said CNN medical analyst Dr. Leana Wen.
Adults catch the common cold around two to three times a year, and children get it even more frequently, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Most people recover in seven to 10 days from the cold, but it can take longer if they have weakened immune systems, the CDC noted.
Some shared symptoms of COVID-19 and the common cold include a sore throat, fatigue and a headache, according to Wen.
Coughing is another common symptom of both viruses, although according to the Mayo Clinic, the COVID-19 cough tends to be drier.
When children contract COVID-19, they tend to have milder symptoms than adults, Wen added.
""I would encourage parents to have a high index of suspicion and to definitely not send your child to school if they are not feeling themselves and have any symptoms that could be COVID-19,"" she said.
Symptoms specific to COVID-19 include loss of smell or taste, Wen said.
Related:
With some severe common cold cases, someone could lose their sense of smell or taste due to nasal congestion, she explained. However, with COVID-19 you often lose your sense of smell or taste early and prior to nasal congestion, Wen added.
People who've contracted COVID-19 may also suffer from diarrhea and nausea or vomiting, symptoms that are never present if it's only the common cold, according to the Mayo Clinic.
COVID-19 and the common cold are also caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is contracted from SARS-CoV-2, while the common cold can result from rhinoviruses, the Mayo Clinic noted.
Get your child tested
If you suspect your child has COVID-19, the most important thing is to not send them to school, Wen cautioned.
""I'm sure no parent would want to have other kids in the class become infected or their classmates' family members, or for the class to have to shut down because their child is symptomatic and may have spread it to others,"" Wen said.
The next step Wen recommended is to get your child tested for COVID-19.
Testing is much more readily available than it was a year ago, she said, and parents should contact their pediatricians for options.
Wen said she expects COVID-19 testing options to be localized, meaning the best places to get tested change depending on where you live. In some instances, local clinics may have availability, or children can go to testing sites run by their county health department.
Avoid the doctors for mild symptoms
For children with mild COVID-19 symptoms, Wen recommended parents think twice before heading to the doctor.
""If you have mild symptoms, if it's COVID or any other viral illnesses, you should not be going into a doctor's office unless you have talked to your pediatrician and they are requesting that you come in,"" Wen said.
If you are symptomatic, Wen said, you could transmit it to someone else by going in.
Get your child vaccinated
Children 12 and older are eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, and Wen recommended parents take their kids to get vaccinated immediately.
It takes two doses plus two weeks before the two-dose vaccines offer maximum protection.
For parents, getting kids vaccinated is ""the best way of preventing their adolescent from contracting COVID-19 on the front end and potentially missing school and other social activities with their friends,"" Wen said.",2021-08-11T00:00:00Z,2021,3,23

Editor's note: The data reported in this story was based on information collected and analyzed on Tuesday. For the latest COVID-19 numbers, visit KSL.com's Coronavirus page.
SALT LAKE CITY — It's clear COVID-19 hasn't gone away.
Utah surpassed 2,000 COVID-19 cases in a day last week for the first time since late January, and the state's seven-day rolling average of over 1,600 cases per day is also the highest since then, according to Utah Department of Health data.
This is somewhat surprising considering the favorable trends the Beehive State experienced throughout the spring and early summer. The seven-day rolling average fell as low as 201 new cases per day on June 1, which remains the lowest it has gotten since late May 2020.
Dr. Eddie Stenehjem, an infectious diseases physician for Intermountain Healthcare, said last week that children are a big factor for Utah's rise in cases — which have steadily increased since June 1 but continued at a faster rate since about mid-August. His colleague, Dr. Brandon Webb, also an infectious diseases physician for Intermountain Healthcare, added that he believes the Labor Day holiday may also play a factor in the number of new cases.
But what about location? Can the location of new cases offer a better picture of the latest COVID-19 wave to arrive in Utah? Here's what the data shows.
Where new cases are happening
There are two ways to show where cases are spreading the most: total cases and case rates. Total cases tend to lean toward higher-populated areas, while case rates provide a scale between new cases and population.
For this analysis, KSL.com looked into recent cases reported by health departments instead of counties. The state is broken down into 13 local health districts.
Let's start with the total number of new cases between June 1 and Tuesday's COVID-19 update.
When you break it down by pure numbers, Salt Lake County still has the most cases. That's not surprising considering it's the most populated county in Utah, nearly doubling any other county in the state, per 2020 U.S. census data.
Utah COVID-19 cases from June 1 through Tuesday's update
- Salt Lake County: 25,201
- Utah County: 16,654
- Davis County: 8,782
- Weber-Morgan: 7,127
- Southwest Utah: 6,727
- Bear River: 4,256
- Central Utah: 2,528
- TriCounty: 2,270
- Tooele County: 2,242
- Southeast Utah: 1,079
- Wasatch County: 831
- Summit County: 678
- San Juan: 231
Source: Utah Department of Health data
The Salt Lake County Health Department has reported a little more than 25,000 new cases since June 1. It's accounted for about 32% of all Utah cases since June 1, but that's still below the 36% it accounts for in terms of all cases reported in Utah since March 2020.
Unsurprisingly, the stats follow this trend. The next four health districts in terms of highest case counts are Utah County, Davis County, Weber-Morgan and Southwest Utah, which are also in the top-five in terms of population, along with the Salt Lake County Health Department.
So what if this was adjusted to scale? This is where you see new trends emerge that weren't seen before in previous statewide upticks.
Unlikely COVID-19 case rate leaders
Two of Utah's most rural areas are where the state's highest case rates are currently happening, according to state health department data. As of Tuesday, the TriCounty (northeastern Utah) and Central Utah health departments carried seven-day rolling averages of 97.6 and 97.1 cases per 100,000 residents, respectively.
Both of those rates are more than three times the current case rate in Salt Lake County. Combined, there are close to 135,000 Utahns within the nine counties —Daggett, Duchesne, Juab, Millard, Piute, Sanpete, Sevier, Uintah and Wayne — that make up the TriCounty and Central Utah health departments; Salt Lake County's population is close to nine times that, per 2020 census data.
What's more is that neither the TriCounty nor the Central Utah health departments held particularly high case rates back when Utah's seven-day running average for case counts reached its low this year on June 1. TriCounty's rate held steady at 10.3 cases per 100,000 while Central Utah's dropped to 4.4 cases per 100,000 at the time.
In TriCounty's case, its case rate is the highest it has ever been since COVID-19 was first documented in Utah. The seven-day running average surpassed 100 cases per day briefly last week, compared to its previous high of 78 last November, according to the health department.
""This is bigger than anything we've ever experienced as far as COVID,"" said Liberty Best, the spokeswoman for TriCounty Health Department, in an interview with KSL.com. ""Last week ... the TriCounty area had over 400 COVID-19 cases that are brand new — and that's more than what we've had in a week since the start of COVID. So, it's been a little intense in terms of COVID cases.""
Central Utah, Tooele County and Southeast Utah, which are second, third and fifth in current case rates in the state, are all relatively close to the highest rates within those districts since the COVID-19 pandemic began.
COVID-19 seven-day running average case rates as of Tuesday
- TriCounty: 97.6
- Central Utah: 97.1
- Tooele County: 79.3
- Bear River: 58.8
- Southeast Utah: 57.5
- Southwest Utah: 57.2
- Davis County: 57.1
- Wasatch County: 54.9
- Utah County: 50.9
- Weber-Morgan: 50.6
- San Juan: 36.4
- Salt Lake County: 29.1
- Summit County: 24.1
Source: Utah Department of Health. Note: Case rate is based on cases per 100,000 residents
The Summit County health district currently holds the lowest rate with a running average of 24.1 cases per 100,000 residents, followed by the Salt Lake County, San Juan County, Weber-Morgan and Utah County health departments.
While all five health districts have also experienced upticks in case rates over the past few weeks, their spikes are nowhere near as noticeable as the current leaders. For instance, the Summit County Health Department reached a seven-day running average of 1.7 cases per 100,000 on June 1. The county also holds Utah's highest case rate average for any period of time during the pandemic, reaching 157.3 cases per 100,000 on Jan. 10.
A link in the data?
What's interesting is how the current local health department case rates mirror the state's vaccination data at the top and bottom. That is, the state health department reports that the TriCounty (29% fully vaccinated, 36% receiving one dose) and Central Utah (33% fully vaccinated, 39% receiving one dose) are two health departments with the lowest vaccination rates in Utah.
Best told KSL.com that there are some discrepancies between the state health department data and TriCounty's own calculations, although both are ""low"" and not where local health officials want them to be.
Much like the state as a whole, older residents are most likely to be vaccinated within the TriCounty health district. Still, the group with the highest vaccination rate in the district, Duchesne County residents 70 to 79 years old at 76%, falls behind the state average. Utah Department of Health data shows that nearly 95% of all Utahns aged 70 to 79 are vaccinated.
Meanwhile, the two health districts with the highest vaccination rates — Summit County (72% fully vaccinated, 82% receiving one dose) and Salt Lake County (56% vaccinated, 63% receiving one dose) — have the lowest case rates.
The order of case rates doesn't quite go in the same order as the vaccination rate for the nine other health districts in between; however, that could be because the other districts have very similar vaccination rates and case rates. All nine remaining districts have fully vaccinated rates hovering between 40% and 51% and seven of those nine have case rates at between 50 and 59 cases per 100,000 people.
The state health department reports that unvaccinated Utahns are 5.9 times at greater risk for testing positive for COVID-19, 6.8 times at greater risk of being hospitalized and 5.1 times at greater risk of dying from COVID-19 than vaccinated Utahns, based on trends over the past four weeks.
While seven-day running average case rates among fully vaccinated Utahns are up since June 1 — from 8.2 to 80.3 per 100,000 — the case rates for unvaccinated Utahns are inching closer to the highest they've ever been during the pandemic. The state health department data shows the case rate for unvaccinated Utahns was 580 per 100,000, as of Tuesday; the current record is 740.8, which was recorded on Nov. 22, 2020, and before vaccines were approved.
The hospitalization rates among unvaccinated Utahns also surged past all previous records this month. In fact, the state health department reported on Tuesday there are 581 hospitalizations tied to COVID-19, which is close to the most it's ever reported at one time.
So, what has COVID-19 been like in areas with less-vaccinated areas?
Trying to reverse trends in rural Utah
The scene has been a bit chaotic for doctors and nurses in northeastern Utah. There are just two hospitals within the TriCounty Health Department and both are ""very full,"" according to Best. Add a record week of new cases and more hospitalizations are likely coming.
What makes the situation there worse is it's not like hospitals can transfer every patient elsewhere on a whim. Since other state hospitals are filling up with COVID-19 patients and intensive care units are above thresholds, there isn't much space for new patients anywhere.
The department has thrown everything imaginable out there trying to persuade residents to get the vaccine, but it's been an uphill battle as a result of misinformation dating back to the start of the pandemic, Best said. Since everyone, including scientists and medical professionals, have the same starting place in terms of COVID-19 knowledge, there's been a lot of information thrown out into the universe — real or fake.
It's something she doesn't believe is unique to northeastern Utah.
""It's hard to weed through the opinion, the misinformation and the facts. And that is definitely something that has been challenging, I'm sure, statewide,"" Best said.
But there are other difficulties within the TriCounty Health Department and rural Utah in general. Most parts of the district are spread out, so many residents don't have the same access to information as residents in more urban areas in the state. Experts point out that many people in rural Utah don't have cable or satellite, and they get most of their information online.
""And where is the misinformation? The internet,"" Best said. ""It's just weeding through what is true and what is not. I think that is definitely a big challenge.""
To that end, TriCounty health officials are trying to find innovative ways to get facts across to residents. They recently sent out a letter to every mailbox and P.O. Box in the region informing them about the threat COVID-19 poses local hospitals. The concern there is that it will lead to more unnecessary deaths not just from COVID-19, but from other causes due to the lack of available care. Unfortunately, the two hospitals were full by the time the letter arrived just because there are that many cases.
Health officials also went online to combat the misinformation there. The health department started a social media video campaign sharing real stories from residents in the area who have battled COVID-19.
""We're trying to get as much truth about everything out there as possible,"" Best said. ""It's very real. We want to protect our health care, we want to protect our community.""
That's also why she shares with others around her that she's vaccinated. She hopes her neighbors will do the same to help reverse the trends impacting rural Utah at the moment.
Best points to vaccines like one for chickenpox that was developed in her lifetime. She grew up with that being a ""normal thing"" but it's now something her children don't really know because of vaccines.
""I think it would be amazing if the next generation would be able to look at their parents and say, ask 'what is COVID?'"" she added. ""Wouldn't that be amazing? We can get there.""",2021-09-16T00:00:00Z,2021,3,23

WASHINGTON — Fighting the omicron variant surging through the country, President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that the government would provide 500 million free rapid tests, increase support for hospitals under strain and redouble vaccination and boosting efforts.
At the White House on Tuesday, Biden detailed major changes to his COVID-19 winter plan, his hand forced by the arrival of the fast-spreading variant, whose properties are not yet fully understood by scientists. Yet his message was clear that the winter holidays could be close to normal for the vaccinated while potentially dangerous for the unvaccinated.
His pleas are not political, he emphasized. He noted that former President Donald Trump has gotten his booster shot, and he said it's Americans' ""patriotic duty"" to get vaccinated.
""It's the only responsible thing to do,"" the president said. ""Omicron is serious and potentially deadly business for unvaccinated people.""
Biden chastised social media and people on cable TV who have made misleading statements to discourage people from getting vaccinated.
The outbreak from this latest strain of the coronavirus has required the federal government to get more aggressive in addressing the likely wave of infections, but Biden promised a weary nation that there would not be a mass lockdown of schools or businesses.
""I know you're tired, and I know you're frustrated. We all want this to be over. But we're still in it,"" Biden said. ""We also have more tools than we had before. We're ready, we'll get through this.""
Scientists don't yet know everything about omicron yet, but they do know that vaccination should offer strong protections against severe illness and death. The variant has spread at such an alarming rate that the Biden administration snapped quickly into action to offer new tests and additional aid.
Rapid testing
A cornerstone of the plan is Biden's decision for the government to purchase 500 million coronavirus rapid tests for free shipment to Americans starting in January. People will use a new website to order their tests, which will then be sent by U.S. mail at no charge, the White House said.
It marks a major shift for Biden, who earlier had called for many Americans to purchase the hard-to-find tests on their own and then seek reimbursement from their health insurance. For the first time, the U.S. government will send free COVID-19 tests directly to Americans, after more than a year of urging by public health experts.
Experts had criticized Biden's initial buy-first, get-paid-later approach as unwieldy and warned that the U.S. would face another round of problems with testing at a critical time. Testing advocates point to places like the U.K. and Germany, which have distributed billions of tests to the public and recommend people test themselves twice a week.
The federal government will also establish new testing sites and use the Defense Production Act to help manufacture more tests. The first new federally supported testing site will open in New York this week. The new testing sites will add to 20,000 already available. White House officials said they're working with Google so that people will be able to find them by searching ""free COVID test near me.""
Still, Biden's testing surge would need to be supported by a further jump in production for all Americans to test at the recommended rate of twice weekly. The U.S. would need 2.3 billion tests per month for everyone 12 and older to do that, according to the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. That's nearly five times the half-billion tests Biden will deploy.
Currently, the U.S. can conduct about 600 million tests per month, with home tests accounting for about half, according to researchers from Arizona State University.
Hospitals overwhelmed
In another prong to Biden's amped-up plan, he is prepared to deploy an additional 1,000 troops with medical skills to assist hospitals buckling under the virus surge. Additionally, he is immediately sending federal medical personnel to Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, Arizona, New Hampshire and Vermont. There are also plans to ready additional ventilators and protective equipment from the national stockpile, expanding hospital resources.
As a backstop, the Federal Emergency Management Agency will deploy hundreds of ambulances and paramedic teams so that if one hospital fills up, they can transport patients to open beds in other facilities. Ambulances are already headed to New York and Maine, and paramedic teams are going to New Hampshire, Vermont and Arizona.
But vaccination remains the main defense since it can head off disease in the first place. The government will support multiple vaccination sites and provide hundreds of personnel to administer shots. New rules will make it easier for pharmacists to work across state lines to administer a broader range of shots.
Biden said in response to a question that he may lift the travel ban that was imposed to delay omicron from reaching the U.S. The president explained that the ban was put in place to ""see how much time we had"" before the variant arrived so that the U.S. could respond based on what was happening in other countries.
Some prominent experts said that Biden's plan is a step in the right direction but the president hasn't gone far enough to try to get ahead of the virus, given the risks of infections and hospitals being overwhelmed.
I know you're tired, and I know you're frustrated. We all want this to be over. But we're still in it.
–Pres. Joe Biden
""I don't know that the measures being proposed are going to be adequate,"" said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
Hotez said the government may need to go a step further by authorizing a second booster shot for health care workers to prevent infections that would sideline clinicians when all hands are needed.
Dr. Eric Topol, professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, said the administration ""finally sees the light"" on testing with Biden's plan to ship 500 million tests, but the type of test being provided is important at a time when the disease can spread quickly.
""We don't have control of this pandemic here,"" said Topol. ""We need to pull out all the stops, and we're not doing that still.""
Topol said the government could redefine ""fully vaccinated"" as three shots instead of two of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, Biden could order the Federal Aviation Administration to bar air travel by people who are not fully vaccinated, and the government could use its authority to ramp up production of high quality masks for free distribution.
""There's a lack of boldness,"" Topol said. ""I am disappointed.""
Scientists say omicron spreads even more easily than other coronavirus strains, including delta. It accounted for nearly three-quarters of new U.S. infections last week.
Underscoring the reach of the virus, the White House said late Monday that Biden had been in close contact with a staff member who later tested positive for COVID-19. The staffer spent about 30 minutes around the president on Air Force One on Friday. The staffer, who was fully vaccinated and boosted, tested positive Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said.
Psaki said Biden has tested negative twice since Sunday and will test again on Wednesday. Citing guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Psaki said Biden didn't need to quarantine and would continue with his regular schedule.
In New York City, nearly 42,600 people citywide tested positive from Wednesday through Saturday — compared with fewer than 35,800 in the entire month of November. The city has never had so many people test positive in such a short period of time since testing became widely available.

SALT LAKE CITY — Children ages 5 to 11 can receive a COVID-19 vaccine at clinics being hosted by Utah's Hogle Zoo this weekend.
The clinics will be open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday and Saturday and a two-dose primary series of the FDA-authorized COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine will be offered to children.
The clinic is free and parental or legal guardian consent is required for this age group. Children must also be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian.
""We are committed to the health and safety of our local community and state, and we are honored to partner with health officials to host this event,"" said Hogle Zoo CEO and president Doug Lund.
Owen Turpin, 5, visited the zoo with his mother Friday so he could get the vaccine.
""I had to get a shot on my arm and I got a Panda Band-Aid,"" he said.
Getting the COVID-19 vaccine is important to him because he doesn't want to spread the virus among his friends and family.
""That's why I came in to get a shot,"" he said.
He was also pretty excited about a day at the zoo after taking care of his vaccination.
""Quarantine was really hard for him,"" said Owen's mother, Camila Turpin. ""We couldn't see our friends. We couldn't go to any activities. So, I just let him know, if you want to continue to do those things and be safe, we have to get the shot.""
It's important for the protection of their entire family, too.
""Just so we can continue to see our family, and also, my youngest has a compromised airway. So, when he gets something like a common cold, he gets croup, which obstructs his airway more, so we just want to be safe,"" she said.
Hogle Zoo is even giving children a chance to see some of their ambassador animals up close, like a bearded dragon.
""If parents decide to bring their kids down, it's a happy experience, rather than being something too stressful they can enjoy it,"" said Jeff Meigs, Hogle Zoo digital media specialist. ""They can relax.""
Parents can register here. The vaccine is free and participants do not need insurance.
Immunizers will be at the zoo's events pavilion to facilitate the vaccination process, provide guidance through the process and administer vaccines.
Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine has received full approval from both the FDA and CDC for kids ages 5-11.
A Pfizer study of 2,268 schoolchildren found the kid-sized doses vaccine were nearly 91% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infections, based on 16 cases of COVID-19 among kids given dummy shots compared to just three who got vaccinated.
The kid dosage also proved safe, with similar or fewer temporary reactions — such as sore arms, fever or achiness — that teens experience.",2021-11-12T00:00:00Z,2021,4,24

SALT LAKE CITY — There's another pill to treat COVID-19 that's expected to be considered for federal approval after Pfizer announced Friday that its new antiviral drug is 89% effective in reducing hospitalizations and deaths from the virus in high-risk adults.
Pfizer, the company behind one of the three COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in the United States, said the clinical trial for the drug paxlovid will be stopped ""due to the overwhelming efficacy demonstrated in these results."" The company said it is seeking emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Last month, Merck and Florida-based Ridgeback Biotherapeutics submitted a similar request for their drug, molnupiravir, after finding it cut the risk of hospitalization or death from COVID-19 by about 50% in adults seen as likely to progress to severe illness because they're older or have certain medical conditions, such as heart disease.
The United Kingdom became the first country to approve the use of the Merck pill Thursday.
The pills, the first medication for COVID-19 patients that can be taken orally rather than being injected or given intravenously, like monoclonal antibody treatments, are being called a game changer for a pandemic now in its second year.
But Dr. Brandon Webb, an Intermountain Healthcare infectious diseases physician, said while the new antiviral treatments are ""good news,"" the pills should not be seen as a substitute for getting vaccinated against the virus and taking other preventive measures such as wearing a mask.
Related:
""Treatments should be looked at as a safety net or a Band-Aid for individuals who unfortunately do get COVID,"" Webb said. ""But they're not a solution to the pandemic.""
Still to come, the doctor said, is detailed data about how safe the pills are to take, and how well they're tolerated by patients. The Pfizer pill series includes a protease inhibitor, part of the drug ""cocktail"" treatment for HIV patients that's been in use for many years.
""There will be some really important real-world practicalities,"" he said. ""From having treated patients with HIV with protease inhibitors, we know that those are very commonly associated with nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, as well as a number of other drug interactions and other things we need to watch out for.""
The pills were initially studied in high-risk patients who had not gotten vaccinated, Webb said, the group most likely to see the biggest benefit. At least initially, the pills are expected to be authorized only for adults considered at high risk of hospitalization or death from COVID-19, and administered under a doctor's care, he said.
""Before we crown it a game changer, I think it's important to recognize that these oral drugs may not be for everyone. Not everyone will tolerate them,"" Webb said, and some may be taking other drugs for medical conditions that could cause issues.
""All drugs have side effects and all drugs have a risk versus benefit profile,"" he said, adding that it's important for people to understand that ""right now, we don't know that the safety of the pills is any better than the safety of the vaccines.""
Concerns have been raised about treatments being viewed as an alternative to vaccination, considered the key to stopping the spread of the deadly virus, Webb said. In Florida and other states, people have skipped vaccines and other cheaper methods of preventing COVID-19 in favor of monoclonal antibody treatments that cost $2,100.
""There's always a concern in the current political environment that the role of treatments for COVID will be misinterpreted as a primary therapy rather than a secondary therapy that is intended to complement preventive measures and vaccinations,"" Webb said.
Only developing immunity to the virus through widespread vaccination can prevent the emergence of new variants — like the delta variant that drove up case counts, hospitalizations and deaths starting last summer — and stop the pandemic, the doctor said.
Pfizer Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla touted the pills in a news release as having ""the potential to save patients' lives, reduce the severity of COVID-19 infections, and eliminate up to nine out of 10 hospitalizations.""
Bourla called the news of the clinical trial results ""a real game-changer in the global efforts to halt the devastation of this pandemic.""
A Pfizer executive who led the drug's development, Annaliesa Anderson, said, ""The results are really beyond our wildest dreams,"" the New York Times reported. She said he hopes the new drug ""can have a big impact on helping all our lives go back to normal again and seeing the end of the pandemic.""",2021-11-05T00:00:00Z,2021,4,24

SALT LAKE CITY — A year ago, schools labored to keep the doors open amid the COVID-19 pandemic that necessitated temporarily shifting to remote instruction when cases exceeded thresholds or even calling off school for a couple of days when administrators were unable to hire enough substitutes to fill in for ill teachers.
Fast forward a year and some schools are again struggling to stay open to deliver instruction and other services students need.
This time, with COVID-19 becoming a bit more manageable as vaccination has become available, a labor shortage is to blame.
School districts have raised substitute teacher pay and are offering stipends for substitutes that teach multiple days for their particular district. Schools are also paying certified teachers to fill in for absent teachers in their schools, which means a little more cash in their pockets but adds to their workloads.
Across the West, the staffing shortages are exacting a toll. The substitute teacher shortage is one factor but so is teachers taking personal time off to rest and regroup to tackle additional demands brought on by the pandemic and helping students, some of whom experienced learning loss when schools could not meet in person, get back on track.
'Difficult and draining'
Some schools have responded by simply calling off classes for a day or two. Others have shifted to remote learning.
Some, like Denver Public Schools, will start its weeklong Thanksgiving break early, closing its school on Friday and resume classes on Monday, Nov. 29.
In a letter to the school community, DPS Superintendent Alex Marrero acknowledged, ""It's been another difficult and draining year"" for students, families and ""our dedicated staff, who are giving tirelessly to support our students while dealing with significant staffing shortages at work and often other strains at home related to the pandemic.""
In Denver, families had ample notice to arrange child care or other activities during Friday's closure.
Elsewhere, parents have been caught off guard by sudden announcements of school cancellations due to substitute and staff shortages.
In Washington state, staffing shortages were further exacerbated by high numbers of staff asking for Fridays off to rest and regroup.
Several Utah school districts have raised substitute teacher salaries and offered stipends to subs who teach multiple days to entice more people to fill in but thus far, only one closed school for the day due to staffing shortages, said Lexi Cunningham, executive director of the Utah School Superintendents Association.
Grand County closed schools for 2 1/2 days at the start of the school year when 10 staff members at Grand County High School tested positive for COVID-19 and there were not enough substitutes to cover classes, said Superintendent Tayrn Kay.
Only the high school was impacted and after the brief closure, the mask-wearing requirement in place in Grand County's elementary schools was also implemented in the district's middle and high schools.
'Exhaustion and burnout'
Kay said the requirement will end at the start of winter break and will not be in place when students return to school in January, acknowledging there is mask-wearing fatigue.
""I'm happy for the opportunity for our students ages 5 to 11 to get vaccinated,"" she said.
On the other hand, Moab relies heavily on tourism so she has some angst about possible transmission from people visiting the area over the holiday break. Otherwise, the community has been dutiful about mitigation measures and has experienced a relatively low number of deaths compared to other similarly sized communities in Utah since the start of the pandemic.
The brief closure in September marked the only time this school year that the district had to shutter due to staffing shortages and ""we've had no (schoolwide) test-to-stay events,"" although one classroom had three students test positive, Kay said.
Canyons School District is taking a different tack, announcing earlier this fall that it will observe one ""remote Friday"" during the months of November to April.
""The goal with remote Fridays is to support teachers in supporting students. Teachers are reporting increased rates of exhaustion and burnout due, in part, to such pandemic-related stressors as staffing shortages,"" the district said in a statement.
Utah schools largely returned to in-person learning in fall 2020. That was not the case in many parts of the country, so those schools are dealing with some of the issues Utah schools have had real-world experience with for more than a year and are more adroit at addressing staff shortages and other challenges presented by pandemic, Cunningham said.",2021-11-18T00:00:00Z,2021,4,24

SALT LAKE CITY — A Utah Jewish group is condemning the use of a swastika displayed at a small anti-COVID-19 vaccine protest at the Governor's Mansion in Salt Lake City on Sunday.
Photos taken from the protest show participants standing on the lawn of the mansion displaying a large red, white and black flag that appears to be fashioned after the Nazi flag, with a swastika symbol crafted out of vaccine syringes.
""We as Americans, regard Nazi symbols as signifiers of the worst hatred, racism and crimes against humanity the world has ever known,"" the United Jewish Federation of Utah said Monday in a news release. ""We have in our community survivors, children of survivors, and brave liberators of the camps where these symbols flourished. The use of such symbols legitimize antisemitism and points to a growing lack of education amongst our citizens of the horrors perpetuated by hate and racism.""
Gov. Spencer Cox's office said the governor was out of town Sunday and did not see the protest.
The demonstration took place late afternoon on Sunday, according to Utah Highway Patrol Sgt. Cameron Roden. Between 20 and 30 people participated in the event and there were no issues reported, Roden added.
Demonstrators displayed another large banner with a photo of Cox, referring to him as ""the real virus,"" as well as a Gadsden flag and other anti-vaccine signs, according to photos taken of the protest.
The Jewish federation encouraged people to use the opportunity to educate. School districts should adopt the Anti-Defamation League's ""No Place For Hate"" program to encourage youth to embrace tolerance and acceptance, the federation's statement says.
""Those who chose to protest have added great pain to many in our community. While we fully support the freedom of expression in our country, the use of such symbols should not be given a free pass,"" the Jewish federation's statement says.",2021-10-04T00:00:00Z,2021,4,24

Editor's note: This article is a part of a series reviewing Utah and U.S. history for KSL.com's Historic section.
SALT LAKE CITY — A 12-year-old Albion Middle School student in Sandy said they were initially thrilled when they heard about then-Gov. Gary Herbert's school closure declaration back on March 13, 2020.
Just two days after Utah Jazz star Rudy Gobert tested positive for the coronavirus, which had only gotten its name a month before, Herbert walked up to the podium inside the Utah State Capitol's Gold Room and declared a two-week ""soft closure"" of all K-12 schools statewide.
That order eventually got extended through the remainder of the school year.
""At first I was happy but then after the first week it got hard and I missed my friends,"" the student, whose name was removed from their responses, wrote in a document for the Utah Division of State History's Utah K-12 COVID-19 Memory Project.
The project, which went online this month, is available for everyone to see not just now but for future generations as a window into what it was like for students in the age of a pandemic, said Lisa Barr, a historical collections curator for the division and the project's creator.
Barr began collecting responses from children in May 2020, two months after the school closures.
""Recognizing that we were living in historic times, we wanted to hear how the pandemic impacted the lives of young people,"" Barr explained. ""We created a tool to help students anonymously share their experiences.""
Most of the collection is the answers to a questionnaire that Barr created, while some students filled out quarantine journals. The point, Barr said, was to gather insight that shows more of the ""unusual, everyday view of contemporary history"" from Utah children dealing with a shared global experience.
The Albion Middle School 12-year-old is one of over 250 responses from nearly two dozen communities across Utah already in state archives, with more possibly on the way. Most came from middle school students but dozens came in from elementary and high school students, too.
Here are a few examples of how they responded picked out at random.
Question: How did you feel when you learned that schools would close because of the COVID-19 pandemic?
- 17-year-old Venture High School (Marriott-Slaterville) student: ""My first emotion was mainly excitement — it was kind of cool to think that we would be able to stay home and still learn. Besides that, though, I was nervous, because I didn't know much about COVID-19 yet. I wasn't sure yet if it was going to be a big issue for me personally."" (Jan. 10, 2021)
- 11-year-old junior high/middle student in Ivins: ""I was disappointed that I would not be finishing my sixth-grade year in the school. I also decided it was for the best, I would rather go to online school than get sick and spread it more."" (May 15, 2020)
- 9-year-old Canyon Rim Academy (Millcreek) student: ""I felt like it was nice to have a change of pace but this was from a bad cause."" (May 4, 2020)
Question: What do you miss the most about school?
- 7-year-old elementary student in Brigham City: ""Recess"" (June 1, 2020)
- 13-year-old junior high/middle student in Naples: ""The thing I miss most about school is my friends. I miss being able to talk to them, laugh with them, and learn with them at school."" (May 4, 2020)
- 16-year-old Ben Lomond High (Ogden) student: ""Some things I miss the most about school is interacting with people and just having the ability to learn and participate in class."" (May 11, 2020)
Question: How do you think the pandemic might impact your life in the future?
- 16-year-old East High (Salt Lake City) student: ""I think the pandemic is going to make me a lot more appreciative for being able to go to school every day and interact with friends and family on a daily basis."" (May 21, 2020)
- 16-year-old Copper Hills High (West Jordan) student: ""The pandemic may impact my life for the better and for the worse – we may have to continue wearing masks and that is a controversial topic in itself, but I also think that the pandemic has impacted me in making me realize that I shouldn't take things for granted, like getting a cup of coffee, going to the theaters and enjoying some popcorn, seeing my close relatives, etc."" (Sept. 10, 2021)
- 16-year-old Stansbury High student: ""I know if I am ever going to feel comfortable going into public without wearing a mask in the near future. Going back to school is going to be insane. My school building is a 4A but we have a 5A amount of students, so we're already packed in 40 to a class. I don't know how we are going to be safe."" (May 25, 2020)
Question: What do you want future generations to know about what it's like to experience a pandemic?
- 12-year-old Albion Middle School (Sandy) student: ""Before this pandemic, I was plenty happy. I just didn't realize it. I wanted more, more, more. Don't take your life for granted! Things can change quickly like it did for us, and you want to spend the time you have with gratitude. I have had so much family time lately, and we will probably never have this again. It is so strange for this to happen, it feels like a dream. I tell myself that it is just a small vacation, it isn't really happening. Yet every night I can't sleep. There is so much fear going around. People are dying! We don't know if there will ever be a vaccine for this, and we don't know all the answers. At first, it was fun not to have school. Now I'm just tired of not going to school. I will never complain about it again."" (May 11, 2020)

Sacrifices are necessary, like not seeing friends or family, not following your normal routine, and not doing things you've looked forward to. It's also mind-numbingly dull. But, there's still an oddly comforting sense of unity in how everyone is struggling at the same time, and there's still always hope and dreams for when things have returned to what they once were.""

CHICAGO — More than a year after the vaccine was rolled out, new cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. have soared to their highest level on record at over 265,000 per day on average, a surge driven largely by the highly contagious omicron variant.
New cases per day have more than doubled over the past two weeks, eclipsing the old mark of 250,000, set in mid-January, according to data kept by Johns Hopkins University.
The fast-spreading mutant version of the virus has cast a pall over Christmas and New Year's, forcing communities to scale back or call off their festivities just weeks after it seemed as if Americans were about to enjoy an almost normal holiday season. Thousands of flights have been canceled amid staffing shortages blamed on the virus.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious-disease expert, said Wednesday that there is no need to cancel small home gatherings among vaccinated and boosted family and friends.
But ""if your plans are to go to a 40- to 50-person New Year's Eve party with all the bells and whistles and everybody hugging and kissing and wishing each other a happy new year, I would strongly recommend that this year we not do that,"" he said.
The threat of omicron and the desire to spend the holidays with friends and loved ones have spurred many Americans to get tested for COVID-19.
Aravindh Shankar, 24, flew to San Jose, California, on Christmas from West Lafayette, Indiana, to be with family. Though he felt fine, he decided to get tested Wednesday just to play it safe, since he had been on an airplane.
He and his family spent almost an entire day searching for a testing appointment for him before he went to a site in a parking lot next to the San Jose airport.
""It was actually surprisingly hard,"" Shankar said about trying to find a test. ""Some people have it harder for sure.""

The picture is grim elsewhere around the world, especially in Europe, with World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus saying he is worried about omicron combining with the delta variant to produce a ""tsunami"" of cases. That, he said, will put ""immense pressure on exhausted health workers and health systems on the brink of collapse.""
The number of Americans now in the hospital with COVID-19 is running at around 60,000, or about half the figure seen in January, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.
While hospitalizations sometimes lag behind cases, the hospital figures may reflect both the protection conferred by the vaccine and the possibility that omicron is not making people as sick as previous versions.
COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. have climbed over the past two weeks from an average of 1,200 per day to around 1,500.
Public health experts will be closely watching the numbers in the coming week for indications of the vaccines' effectiveness in preventing serious illness, keeping people out of the hospital and relieving strain on exhausted health care workers, said Bob Bednarczyk, a professor of global health and epidemiology at Emory University.
CDC data already suggests that the unvaccinated are hospitalized at much higher rates than those who have gotten inoculated, even if the effectiveness of the shots decreases over time, he said.
""If we're able to weather this surge with hopefully minimal disruptions to the overall health care system, that is a place where vaccines are really showing their worth,"" Bednarczyk said.
If your plans are to go to a 40- to 50-person New Year's Eve party with all the bells and whistles and everybody hugging and kissing and wishing each other a happy new year, I would strongly recommend that this year we not do that.
–Dr. Anthony Fauci
It's highly unlikely that hospitalization numbers will ever rise to their previous peak, said Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at the Bloomberg School Public Health. Vaccines and treatments developed since last year have made it easier to curb the spread of the virus and minimize serious effects among people with breakthrough infections.
""It's going to take some time for people to get attuned to the fact that cases don't matter the same way they did in the past,"" Adalja said. ""We have a lot of defense against it.""
But even with fewer people hospitalized compared with past surges, the virus can wreak havoc on hospitals and health care workers, he added.
""In a way, those hospitalizations are worse because they're all preventable,"" he said.
Several European countries, including France, Greece, Britain and Spain, also reported record case counts this week, prompting a ban on music at New Year's celebrations in Greece and a renewed push to encourage vaccination by French authorities.
WHO reported that new COVID-19 cases worldwide increased 11% last week from the week before, with nearly 4.99 million recorded Dec. 20-26. But the U.N. health agency also noted a decline in cases in South Africa, where omicron was first detected just over a month ago.

TAOS, N.M. — Nearly a year after COVID-19 vaccines were first administered in the United States, the country is returning to many of the hallmarks that defined earlier pandemic life: mask mandates, mass vaccination sites, crowded hospitals and a rising death toll.
Amid hope that humanity would soon get the upper hand on the coronavirus, New York City intensive care unit nurse Sandra Lindsay received a dose of Pfizer's just-approved vaccine last Dec. 14, becoming the first inoculated U.S. resident.
Since then, more than 200 million others — more than 60% of the U.S. population — have gotten at least two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines or one Johnson & Johnson's single-shot inoculation, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Despite that triumph of modern science, the country's death toll continues to mount. Since the first dose was administered, nearly 500,000 more people have died of COVID-19, with the country expected to cross the 800,000 mark next week, according to a Reuters tally.
Both infections — approaching 50 million since the start of the pandemic — and deaths have been rising in recent weeks, especially as colder weather in northern states pushes activities indoors, allowing for easier virus transmission.
Resurging infections on Friday prompted New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, to temporarily reimpose a requirement for face coverings inside businesses and venues that do not require proof of vaccination.
""We shouldn't have reached the point where we are confronted with a winter surge, especially with the vaccine at our disposal, and I share many New Yorkers' frustration that we are not past this pandemic yet,"" Hochul said in a statement.
Mask mandates, which Republican governors mostly eschewed as government overreach, were a common infection-prevention tool for many Democratic governors during the pandemic's worst surge, which began during the year-end holiday season of 2020.
Combating the virus has been complicated by its more aggressive mutations, including the currently dominant delta variant and fast-spreading omicron, which was first identified last month and has already been detected in nearly half of the 50 states.
The politicization of vaccines and hesitancy of many Americans to get the shots has also helped keep the pandemic going, usually with more deadly results, experts said.
In New Mexico, hospitals are reaching record capacity levels as unvaccinated patients fill ICUs.
In one of the Southwestern state's hardest-hit hospitals in San Juan County, critical care beds filled up as fast as patients were discharged or died. Dr. Erin Philpott said eight of her patients had died in the last week, most of them unvaccinated.
""It's sometimes hard to even feel because it's so much and it's constant,"" Philpott said.
""You can see the rooms fill up right after, and you don't have a second to pause and just process all this loss."" Philpott added that many of those dying from COVID-19 at San Juan Regional Medical Center were in their 30s and 40s, and mostly male.
Around 94% of COVID-19 deaths at the hospital are among the unvaccinated. ""It feels like it's impossible to keep seeing this and dealing with it,"" said Philpott. ""I think that's why half the staff have gone.""
Nurse Patricia Thomas stood by a dead patient she had treated, a white sheet over his body, a picture of his family at his feet. His relatives made the decision to take him off life support. He was not vaccinated. He had five children and 12 grandchildren.
Choking back tears, Sanders said: ""We took the tubes out and let them hold his hand while he passed comfortably. Today was pretty hard because it's my third one this week.""
'Fuel for this fire'
As with other states with early high vaccination rates like Vermont, Rhode Island and New Hampshire, immunity has waned in New Mexico, pushing these states toward the top of rankings for new cases.
The state's Democratic governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, pushed vaccinations early in 2021 to try to limit hospitalizations.
""The fuel for this fire, our case counts, is unvaccinated individuals,"" New Mexico Acting Health Secretary David Scrase told reporters. ""Our hospitals are in a really grave situation.""
Three out of four COVID-19 patients in the state are unvaccinated, officials said. The same was true for Michigan, dealing with one of the nation's worst outbreaks.
In Connecticut, health officials this week said unvaccinated people are five times more likely to get infected with COVID-19, 12 times more likely to be hospitalized and 16 times more likely to die.
Shortly after the omicron variant was detected in New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy this week reopened one of the state's previously shuttered mass vaccination sites in an effort to encourage residents to get booster shots.
Most of the large vaccination sites that states opened early this year to speed inoculations have closed.
The CDC estimates that about one-fourth of Americans have gotten additional booster shots so far. They have now been authorized for everyone age 16 and up.
Another symbol of the early pandemic, the contaminated cruise ship, also re-emerged this week.
On Monday, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings said a South African crew member suspected of having the omicron variant was among 17 cases of the virus detected on a ship that disembarked in New Orleans over the weekend.
In March 2020 when relatively few cases had been reported in the United States, the cruise ship Grand Princess was held at sea for days before being allowed dock in Oakland, California. Its 2,400 passengers were sent into quarantine at military bases after tests revealed 21 positive cases of the coronavirus.

LOS ANGELES — As Ohio State and Utah players made their way through Disneyland Monday, one of the week's favorite pregame events was canceled as a precaution for a recent surge in COVID-19 cases around the U.S.
The Lawry's Beef Bowl, an event where players are served an extravagant prime rib dinner that has been called ""the greatest meal in America"" by Lawry's founder Richard N. Frank, was nixed ""given the growing concerns around COVID-19 and the Omicron variant,"" according to a statement from Lawry's Beverly Hills.
Players from both teams will still get their promised dinner, but it will be delivered to each team's hotel instead of as an in-person event.
While not the greatest of tragedies in the history of the world, the canceled event served as the latest reminder that after nearly two years of a global pandemic, not everything is back to normal — even in the sports world and the pageantry of one of the most celebrated bowl games.
That's even more true given that four bowl games have already been canceled this season and two more were at risk until two other teams were inserted last minute to salvage the games.
Several college basketball games have also been canceled already this season, and professional leagues — NBA, NFL and NHL — have struggled to maintain a consistent roster over the last few weeks as players enter health and safety protocols. It's an unpredictable problem that was thought to be something only from an unforgettable 2020 year.
Welcome back, I guess.
But until the ball is officially kicked off on Saturday (3 p.m. MST, ESPN) in the 108th Rose Bowl, there's growing caution about the game. There's no reason to believe either team is in trouble, but there's also no guarantee, either.
So should you be worried about the Rose Bowl being canceled, especially if you've already planned a trip to Pasadena on New Year's Day? That's not an easy question to answer, but the Rose Bowl is committed to hosting the game unless it absolutely can't be played.
Both team's will continue to utilize the protocols from the regular season for testing athletes for COVID-19, which could include testing asymptomatic athletes or only vaccinated players that have symptoms.
Utah head coach Kyle Whittingham said Monday his team is now 99% vaccinated — only one player hasn't been vaccinated — and he's optimistic that his team will be able to play the game, and he believed Ohio State will be in a similar situation.
""Well, I don't know why there should be, but I'm confident,"" Whittingham said of the fear of a game being canceled. ""I'm hoping that everything can continue on its course. We seem to be doing OK as a team — knock on wood — and expecting Ohio State the same.""
Utah receiver Britain Covey agreed with his head coach and believed the team has approached the protocols with the right mindset.
""We try to wear masks, we do whatever we can,"" Covey said. 'This is what we've been aiming for for years now, so if it's going to be canceled, it's not going to be on our part because we've talked about this as a team. We're just trying our best thing to keep this thing.
""I know we're at Disneyland right now, which kind of seems counterintuitive, but at the same time it's part of the bowl experience and we're hoping for the best.""
The rules in California are different to that of Utah, but the team has followed the rules as best as possible since landing in California Sunday night. In Disneyland, the players wore masks indoors while some didn't while walking around outside in the park. But to their credit, the park doesn't require masks to be worn when outside.
Covey's teammate, linebacker Devin Lloyd, said the team has been ""really safe as far as COVID protocols"" so far and that he wasn't worried about the game being canceled.
""I know this team has done a great job from past years and up to this point of just being smart, not putting themselves in position to where they could be knocked out for COVID reasons and stuff like that,"" Lloyd said. ""I'm not really too worried about that. I'm really just focused on preparing for Ohio State.""
The Rose Bowl has lightly changed the week's plan by eliminating one press conference and the Beef Bowl, and only vaccinated members of the media may cover the week's events as a precaution, but it hasn't gone as far as other New Year's Six games and the two semifinal games of the College Football Playoff where most events are limited to only the team.
Ahead of the week's events, Rose Bowl officials said they were ""monitoring the situation very closely"" but they felt ""confident in our ability to host both the parade and the game successfully, and in compliance with all the applicable government protocols needed to keep everyone safe.""
So until something drastically changes — and that's fully in the realm of possibility — there's reason to have confidence in the game being played. After all, there's still four days to go before kickoff.",2021-12-28T00:00:00Z,2021,4,24

SALT LAKE CITY — Utah joined a dozen states in a lawsuit Monday challenging the Biden administration's vaccine mandate for Medicare and Medicaid providers and suppliers, and asked a federal court in Louisiana to put the rule on hold.
The Republican-led states argue in the 49-page complaint that the mandate is unconstitutional and that the administration has ""co-opted"" the Medicare and Medicaid system to impose a vaccine on 17 million health care workers.
""The Biden administration is playing statutory shell games with the courts, straining to justify an unjustifiable and unprecedented attempt to federalize public health policy and diminish the sovereign states' constitutional powers,"" according to the lawsuit.
In addition to the lawsuit, the states filed a motion seeking a preliminary injunction to bar the mandate from taking effect.
""To protect healthcare coverage in rural areas, Utah just filed a third #vaccinemandate lawsuit. This focuses on the 'jabs or jobs' mandate for healthcare workers,"" the Utah Attorney General's Office tweeted.

Utah has now signed onto three lawsuits against rules the Biden administration has imposed to increase the COVID-19 vaccination rate among Americans. The other two lawsuits involved federal contractors and businesses with 100 or more employees.
The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans last week barred the Occupational Safety and Health Administration from implementing or enforcing the rule requiring workers in larger businesses to be vaccinated or test negative for the coronavirus at least once a week or be fired pending further litigation. Companies that don't comply could be fined nearly $14,000 per violation.
A federal judge in St. Louis is considering whether to put the vaccine mandate for federal contractors on hold.
In the latest lawsuit, the states contend the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' emergency rule for health care workers overstepped its authority. Forcing health care workers to take the shot or leave the Medicare and Medicaid workforce, puts patients at risk.
""The vaccine mandate causes grave danger to the vulnerable persons whom Medicare and Medicaid were designed to protect — the poor, children, sick, and the elderly — by forcing the termination of millions of essential 'health care heroes,'"" according to the lawsuit.
Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry is leading the lawsuit.
""While CMS says Jab or Job, I say the feds will not impose medical tyranny on Louisiana's people without my best fight!"" he tweeted.

Just now, I led 11 states in a lawsuit challenging the federal government's COVID vaccine mandate for healthcare workers.
Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, CMS director, said earlier this month that the rule addresses the risk of unvaccinated health care staff to patient safety and provides stability and uniformity across the nation's health care system to strengthen the health of people and the providers who care for them.
""Ensuring patient safety and protection from COVID-19 has been the focus of our efforts in combating the pandemic and the constantly evolving challenges we're seeing,"" she said in a Nov. 4 statement.
Facilities covered by the rule must establish a policy ensuring all eligible staff have received the first dose of a two-dose COVID-19 vaccine or a one-dose COVID-19 vaccine prior to providing any care, treatment, or other services by Dec. 6.
Ensuring patient safety and protection from COVID-19 has been the focus of our efforts in combating the pandemic and the constantly evolving challenges we're seeing.
–Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, CMS director
Requiring health care workers to take the shot or leave the Medicare and Medicaid workforce harms access to care as well as quality of patient care, the states argue. The lawsuit says the Social Security Act focuses on patient welfare and patient access to care.
""This 'one-size-fits-all sledgehammer' expressly undermines the Social Security Act's singular focus on providing access to care,"" according to the complaint.
The states say the goal of the mandate is to ""coerce"" the unvaccinated workers into submission or cause them to lose their livelihoods.
""Though medical and religious exemptions may be granted in narrow circumstances, the goal of the program is to vaccinate nearly all health care workers,"" The lawsuit says. ""This can be done only by changing millions of minds or losing millions of health care workers.""
The 12 states filing the lawsuit are Louisiana, Montana, Arizona, Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Utah and West Virginia.",2021-11-15T00:00:00Z,2021,4,24

WASHINGTON — In a potential leap forward in the global fight against the pandemic, drugmaker Merck said Friday that its experimental pill for people sick with COVID-19 reduced hospitalizations and deaths by half.
That could add a whole new, easy-to-use weapon to an arsenal that already includes the COVID-19 vaccine.
The company said it will soon ask health officials in the U.S. and around the world to authorize the pill's use. A decision from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration could come within weeks after that, and the drug, if it gets the OK, could be distributed quickly soon afterward.
If cleared, it would be the first pill shown to treat COVID-19. All other therapies now authorized in the U.S. require an IV or injection. A pill taken at home, by contrast, would ease pressure on hospitals and could also help curb outbreaks in poorer and more remote corners of the world that don't have access to the more expensive infusion therapies.
""This would allow us to treat many more people much more quickly and, we trust, much less expensively,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University who was not involved in the research.
Merck and its partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics said early results showed patients who received the drug, molnupiravir, within five days of COVID-19 symptoms had about half the rate of hospitalization and death as those who received a dummy pill.
The study tracked 775 adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who were considered high risk for severe disease because of health problems such as obesity, diabetes or heart disease. The results have not been reviewed by outside experts, the usual procedure for vetting new medical research.
Among patients taking molnupiravir, 7.3% were either hospitalized or died at the end of 30 days, compared with 14.1% of those getting the dummy pill. After that time period, there were no deaths among those who received the drug, compared with eight in the placebo group, according to Merck.
The results were so strong that an independent group of medical experts monitoring the trial recommended stopping it early.
Company executives said they plan to submit the data to the FDA in the coming days.
These shouldn't be seen as replacements for vaccination — the two should be seen as two strategies that can be used together to significantly reduce severe disease.
–Andrew Pekosz of Johns Hopkins University
Even with the news of a potentially effective new treatment, experts stressed the importance of vaccines for controlling the pandemic, given that they help prevent transmission and also reduce the severity of illness in those who do get infected.
White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients said that vaccination will remain the government's main strategy for controlling the pandemic. ""We want to prevent infections, not just wait to treat them when they happen,"" he said.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's foremost authority on infectious diseases, called the results from Merck ""very good news.""
Merck only studied its drug in people who were not vaccinated. But FDA regulators may consider authorizing it for broader use in vaccinated patients who get breakthrough COVID-19 symptoms.
Andrew Pekosz of Johns Hopkins University predicted vaccines and antiviral drugs would ultimately be used together to protect against the worst effects of COVID-19.
""These shouldn't be seen as replacements for vaccination — the two should be seen as two strategies that can be used together to significantly reduce severe disease,"" said Pekosz, a virology specialist.
Patients take four pills of molnupiravir twice a day for five days. Side effects were reported by both groups in the Merck trial, but they were slightly more common among those who received a dummy pill. The company did not specify the problems.
Earlier study results showed the drug did not benefit patients who were already hospitalized with severe disease. That's not surprising, given that antiviral drugs are most effective when used before the virus ramps up in the body.
The U.S. has approved one antiviral drug, remdesivir, for COVID-19, and allowed emergency use of three antibody therapies that help the immune system fight the virus. But all the drugs are expensive and have to given by IV or injection at hospitals or clinics, and supplies have been stretched by the latest surge of the delta variant.
The antibody drugs have been shown to reduce hospitalization and death by roughly 70% when given to high-risk patients, roughly 20 percentage points more than Merck's pill. But experts cautioned against comparing results from the two, given the preliminary nature of Merck's data.

Health experts, including Fauci, have long called for a convenient pill that patients could take when COVID-19 symptoms first appear, much the way Tamiflu is given to help speed recovery from the flu.
Like other antivirals, Merck's pill works by interfering with the virus's ability to copy its genetic code and reproduce itself.
The U.S. government has committed to purchasing enough pills to treat 1.7 million people, assuming the FDA authorizes the drug. Merck said it can produce pills for 10 million patients by the end of the year and has contracts with governments worldwide. The company has not announced prices.
Several other companies, including Pfizer and Roche, are studying similar drugs and could report results in the coming weeks and months.
Merck had planned to enroll more than 1,500 patients in its late-stage trial before the independent board stopped it early. The results reported Friday included patients across Latin America, Europe and Africa. Executives estimated 10% of patients studied were from the U.S.",2021-10-01T00:00:00Z,2021,4,24

WASHINGTON — In the biggest challenge to abortion rights in decades, the Supreme Court's conservative majority on Wednesday signaled they would allow states to ban abortion much earlier in pregnancy and may even overturn the nationwide right that has existed for nearly 50 years.
With hundreds of demonstrators outside chanting for and against, the justices led arguments that could decide the fate of the court's historic 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion throughout the United States and its 1992 ruling in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which reaffirmed Roe.
The outcome probably won't be known until next June. But after nearly two hours of arguments, all six conservative justices, including three appointed by former President Donald Trump, indicated they would uphold a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy.
At the very least, such a decision would undermine Roe and Casey, which allow states to regulate but not ban abortion up until the point of fetal viability, at roughly 24 weeks.
And there was also substantial support among the conservative justices for getting rid of Roe and Casey altogether. Justice Clarence Thomas is the only member of the court who has openly called for overruling the two cases.
Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, asked whether the court would be better off withdrawing completely from the abortion issue and letting states decide.
""Why should this court be the arbiter rather than Congress, the state legislatures, state supreme courts, the people being able to resolve this?"" Kavanaugh asked. ""And there will be different answers in Mississippi and New York, different answers in Alabama than California.""
Abortion would soon become illegal or severely restricted in roughly half the states if Roe and Casey are overturned, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights. Legislatures in many Republican-led states are poised for action depending on the Supreme Court's ruling.
People of color and lesser means would be disproportionately affected, supporters of abortion rights say.
The court's three liberal justices said that reversing Roe and Casey would significantly damage the court's own legitimacy.
""Will this institution survive the stench that this creates in the public perception that the Constitution and its reading are just political acts?"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked.
In unusually strong terms for a high-court argument, Justice Stephen Breyer warned his colleagues they ""better be damn sure"" before they throw away the established abortion decisions.
Related:
Public opinion polls show support for preserving Roe, though some surveys also find backing for greater restrictions on abortion.
Among the conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts appeared most interested in a less sweeping ruling that would uphold the Mississippi law but not explicitly overrule Roe and Casey.
""That may be what they're asking for, but the thing at issue before us today is 15 weeks,"" Roberts said, alluding to Mississippi's call to overturn the broader cases in addition to upholding its own law.
More than 90% of abortions are performed in the first 13 weeks of pregnancy, well before viability, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
About 100 patients per year get abortions after 15 weeks at the Jackson Women's Health Organization, Mississippi's lone abortion clinic. The facility does not provide abortions after 16 weeks.
Even upholding the 15-week ban would mean rejecting the decades-old viability line. Abortion rights supporters say that would effectively overturn Roe and leave no principled line for when abortions might be banned.
Justice Neil Gorsuch, another Trump appointee, suggested the lack of a rigorous alternative might be a reason to overrule Roe and Casey entirely.
""You emphasized that if 15 weeks were approved, then we'd have cases about 12 and 10 and 8 and 6, and so my question is, is there a line in there that the government believes would be principled or not,"" Gorsuch asked Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, the Biden administration lawyer supporting the Mississippi clinic.
""I don't think there's any line that could be more principled than viability,"" Prelogar said.
Supporters of both sides in the abortion debate filled the sidewalk and street in front of the court, their dueling rallies audible even from inside the building. Opposing signs read such sentiments as ""Her Body Her Choice"" and ""God Hates the Shedding of Innocent Blood."" The court stepped up security measures, including closing off some streets around the building.
Perhaps in recognition of the gravity of the issue before them, the justices took the bench at 10 o'clock without any smiles or the private jokes they sometimes share.
The case came to a court with a 6-3 conservative majority that has been transformed by the justices named by Trump — Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.
A month ago, the justices also heard arguments over a uniquely designed Texas law that has succeeded in getting around the Roe and Casey decisions and banned abortions in the nation's second-largest state after about six weeks of pregnancy. The legal dispute over the Texas law revolves around whether it can be challenged in federal court, rather than the right to an abortion.
The court has yet to rule on the Texas law, and the justices have refused to put it on hold while the matter is under legal review.
The Mississippi case poses questions more central to the abortion right. State Solicitor General Scott Stewart said Roe and Casey ""haunt our country"" and ""have no basis in the Constitution.""
He compared those decisions to Plessy v. Ferguson, the infamous Supreme Court ruling from 1896 that justified official segregation before it was overruled by Brown v. Board of Education 58 years later.
""We're running on 50 years of Roe. It is an egregiously wrong decision that has inflicted tremendous damage on our country and will continue to do so and take innumerable human lives unless and until this court overrules it,"" he said.
The Mississippi clinic argued that those two cases were correctly decided and have been relied on by women and their partners for nearly a half-century, a point also made by Justice Elena Kagan.
The abortion decisions are ""part of the fabric of women's existence in this country,"" she said.
Barrett approached the issue of women's reliance on the abortion rulings from a different vantage point. She suggested that so-called safe haven laws in all 50 states that allow mothers to relinquish parental rights mean women can't be forced into motherhood, which could limit employment and other opportunities.
""Why don't the safe haven laws take care of that problem?"" she asked.
Barrett, with a long record of personal opposition to abortion, acknowledged the court still has to deal with the issue of forcing women to remain pregnant against their will.
She described such a pregnancy as ""an infringement on bodily autonomy, you know, which we have in other contexts, like vaccines.""
In its earlier rulings, the court has rooted the right to abortion in the section of the 14th Amendment that says states cannot ""deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.""
Same-sex marriage and other rights, based on the same provision but also not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, could be threatened if Roe and Casey fall, the administration argues.
Abortion arguments normally would find people camped out in front of the court for days in the hope of snagging some of the few seats available to the public. But with the courthouse closed because of COVID-19, there was only a sparse audience of reporters, justices' law clerks and a handful of lawyers inside the courtroom.
If the court issues its decision in late June it will be a little more than four months before next year's congressional elections, and could become a campaign season rallying cry.

SALT LAKE CITY — The pandemic.
The nearly yearlong ravages of the COVID-19 virus left little for Deseret News editors to debate when they rallied for their annual assessment of the year's most important news stories.
Those were the opening lines of Deseret News reporter Art Raymond's compilation of the top Utah news stories of 2020. It could begin the same this year, with only slight variation. The deadly virus ravaged the state for all of 2021 as the pandemic has yet to let up, even as more Utahns become vaccinated.
On top of the coronavirus-induced hardships, severe drought plagued Utah and much of the West. Political strife, often over the pandemic, elections and redistricting, also continued in a sharply divided climate. Amid all of that, Utah's economy remained robust and the state's housing market saw a year like no other.
1. The pandemic continues
Going on nearly two years now, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact life in Utah, the nation and the world. Early in the year, cases in the state appeared to be on a downward trend. But the highly contagious delta variant sent case counts skyrocketing in the summer, and they have mostly remained high since. The Utah Department of Health considers the transmission rate in all but three of the state's 29 counties high or very high.
The state health department had reported 617,697 COVID-19 cases and 3,704 deaths as of Dec. 17.
Nearly all of the nation's COVID-19 cases are still fueled by the delta variant that first surfaced last spring and sparked surges starting in the summer, including a spike that branded Utah and the Intermountain West as the nation's hot spot for the virus.
As more Utahns became sick, hospitals became overwhelmed with patients, keeping intensive care units filled to capacity and forcing many surgeries to be delayed.
Even as the delta variant drove a surge in cases, the new omicron variant seeped into the state. Utah public health officials have called the new strain a ""wild card"" as it starts to spread across the United States.
Utah marked Dec. 15 as one year since the first doses of the COVID-19 vaccine were made available to health care workers. Since the shots have become available to everyone over age 5, 62.2% of the population has been fully vaccinated. So far, more than 500,000 fully vaccinated Utahns have gotten a booster shot.
Local public health officials tussled with state lawmakers over mask mandates. The Utah Legislature specifically barred school districts from requiring masks, so at the start of the school year, local health departments in Salt Lake, Grand and Summit counties issued emergency health orders for masking in elementary schools. The Salt Lake County Council quickly overturned that county's order, but Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall came up with her own executive order for masks in the city's K-12 schools.
2. Drought plagues Utah, the West
Severe drought left Utah and part of the West, Southwest and Great Plains parched for much of the year. Water shortages gripped 17 states in 95% of the service area of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, and half of that area experienced severe or extreme conditions.
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox issued a state of emergency due to drought conditions in March with the entire state categorized in moderate drought, and about 90% of the state facing extreme drought.
The Weber Basin Water Conservancy District that operates multiple northern Utah reservoirs called the conditions dire. Reservoirs in that area were at record lows.
The nation's two largest reservoirs — Lake Mead and Lake Powell — saw their capacity drop by half in a five-year period, leaving them at their lowest levels since they started filling decades ago.
In response to drought, water providers across the state instituted voluntary or mandatory cutbacks on secondary watering on landscapes, which makes up a whopping 60% of Utah's municipal and industrial water consumption. The shortage forced water managers to dip into emergency supplies for farmers and ranchers.
Early season snowstorms gave a glimmer of hope for the new water year, which started Oct. 1, but a dry November didn't do much to help the snowpack, according to state water officials. With 95% of Utah's water supply coming from snowpack, many more storms are needed to reach an average snowpack.
3. Crazy housing market
In a word, the housing market in Utah and some places in the West was crazy. Utah, Arizona, Idaho and Nevada saw record-breaking home sales and price increases.
Wasatch Front homes were on the market a slim median of five days in the first quarter of the year, a huge drop from 28 days in the first quarter of 2020. In Salt Lake County, Utah's most populous county, 19,194 homes sold, breaking the previous all-time record of 18,907 homes in 2005. The median price in the county for single-family homes climbed to $468,000 in the first quarter, up $68,000 or 17% from a year earlier.
And the frenzy really didn't settle down. By the third quarter, the median home price in Salt Lake County had jumped to $550,000.
The number of sales of all housing types across the Wasatch Front did drop by the end of October, a sign the Utah market has stabilized, according to the Salt Lake Board of Realtors.
As home prices have continued to rise across the country, especially in the West, a recent study suggested prices are poised to flatten in five of the ""most overvalued markets"" in the nation, which include Ogden and Provo.
4. New era for Larry H. Miller companies
The Larry H. Miller Group of Companies, one of Utah's biggest and most recognizable businesses underwent massive changes.
The company, now owned by the late Larry H. Miller's wife, Gail Miller, sold Larry H. Miller auto dealerships, a portfolio of over 70 auto centers across the West that were all owned for over four decades by the household name.
The news came on the heels of several other major moves by the company, including, the sale of the Utah Jazz to Qualtrics CEO Ryan Smith; the acquisition of Advanced Health Care Corp.; and the purchase of Daybreak, one of Salt Lake County's largest master-planned communities in suburban South Jordan.
Steve Starks, CEO of the Miller Group of Companies, said the move out of the car dealership business is a step toward diversifying the company's portfolio with a goal of ""continuing to enrich the community.""
5. The Utah congressional delegation
What was expected to be a routine counting of Electoral College votes in Congress turned into a deadly siege when hundreds of election protesters who supported soon-to-be-former President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol. During the mayhem, Trump accidentally called Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, amid the evacuation of the Senate chamber. As Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, fled the chamber, a Capitol Police officer redirected him away from the mob. Newly sworn Rep. Blake Moore, R-Utah, feared for his life as armed protesters pounded on the barricaded House chamber door.
After authorities restored order in the Capitol, Congress returned to certify the electoral votes declaring Democrat Joe Biden the winner. Utah Reps. Chris Stewart and Burgess Owens were among Republican House members who voted for the failed objection to certifying the Pennsylvania results.
House Democrats went on to impeach Trump for inciting an insurrection. Utah's four GOP congressmen, including Rep. John Curtis, voted against impeachment. In the Senate trial, Romney was among seven Republicans and all 50 Democrats who voted to remove Trump from office. Lee voted against conviction. Trump was acquitted.
On major legislation, all six members of the Utah delegation voted against Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package in March, saying it's wasteful, saddles future generations with insurmountable debt and is largely unneeded in Utah.
In November, Romney stood alone among the delegation in voting for the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, a bipartisan package he helped negotiate to repair the nation's roads, bridges and utilities.
6. Utah Legislature on new congressional district boundaries
Ignoring maps drawn by the voter-approved Independent Redistricting Commission, the Republican-controlled Utah Legislature adopted new congressional district boundaries of its own making in a November special session. Lawmakers approved the map despite multiple failed attempts by Democrats to prevent it from ""splitting"" or ""cracking"" many of their home communities, swaths in Salt Lake County that make up some of the state's more urban, liberal areas.
During its 45-day general session earlier in the year, lawmakers exerted legislative control over COVID-19 restrictions. The Legislature passed bills to restrict the governor's emergency powers and spell out a timeline to end Utah's pandemic-related restrictions — including a statewide mask mandate.
7. Dixie State University name change
Emotions ran high in southern Utah and across the state over the debate to rename Dixie State University. A proposed name change for the St. George-based school was one of the most contentious issues Utah lawmakers considered during the year.
Discussions about the university's name had been going on for decades but intensified after protests across the country following George Floyd's murder in May 2020 while in police custody in Minneapolis.
A study found the Dixie name problematic for students and alumni and had hindered the university's ability to recruit students, faculty, staff and had limited its ability to build partnerships and obtain grants and funding. While the name is cherished in the region, nationally it did not encompass inclusion and acceptance, school officials said. Opponents said stripping the Dixie title would be akin to cancel culture.
In the end, after months of debate, discussion, petitions and protest, the school's name was changed to Utah Tech University.
8. Utah economy remains robust
Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, Utah has one of the strongest economies in the country, though like everywhere else supply chain issues caused some headaches.
Utah's unemployment rate of 2.4% has held down the No. 2 spot in the nation, bested only by Nebraska's 2% for the month of September according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. While the state has more overall jobs than it did before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the job participation rate is still lagging behind pre-pandemic levels.
Supply chain transportation issues combined with understaffed manufacturing and distribution operations amid national labor shortages amplified challenges for retailers in all sectors. Shipping delays, out-of-stock items and higher prices led to some holiday shopping angst.
All those issues weigh on the minds of those running companies or working toward building continued growth, but some in Utah's economic community believe the best is yet to come.
9. Afghan refugees make new home in Utah
Amid the pullout, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox penned a letter to President Joe Biden, telling the administration that the state stands ready to welcome refugees from Afghanistan. The state partnered with the International Rescue Committee and Catholic Community Services to receive the Afghans.
In all, 765 Afghan refugees who fled the country as the Taliban overtook Kabul were scheduled to be resettled in Utah. Some shared harrowing stories of their escape during the chaotic and deadly withdrawal that left 13 U.S. service members dead outside the Kabul airport, including Staff Sgt. Taylor Hoover, a Marine from Utah.
10. Gabby Petito
The disappearance and suspected murder of Gabby Petito captured the nation's attention, and for a time focused on southern Utah. The 22-year-old woman went missing during a cross-country road trip with her fiance, Brian Laundrie. Their travels took them through Utah, including Moab where police in August investigated an incident between the couple.
Moab police and Arches National Park rangers talked to Petito and Laundrie about a possible domestic assault, stemming from an argument. Police separated the couple for the night but didn't file any charges.
Petito's body was found near an undeveloped camping area bordering Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming in September. A Wyoming coroner determined she had been strangled to death. Laundrie returned to his Florida home driving Petito's van 10 days before her family reported her missing. He also disappeared. His remains were discovered at the end of October in a Florida nature reserve. He died by suicide from a gunshot to the head.",2021-12-20T00:00:00Z,2021,4,24

SALT LAKE CITY – The COVID-19 pandemic has had a staggering impact on law enforcement agencies across the country and is now the leading reported cause of line-of-duty deaths among officers.
While those serving in the profession are often at an increased risk of exposure, some are also skeptical of vaccines and other health safety measures.
Utah agencies have avoided controversial vaccine mandates with varying levels of success, raising complicated questions about whether enough is being done to protect both police and the public.
'I don't want to die'
A Utah deputy who was not vaccinated is among those currently hospitalized with COVID-19. After 28 years of life and love, Ricki Draper struggles to describe her husband.
""I have a hard time describing him just because he is so amazing and wonderful,"" she said.
Still, she tries. ""He is larger than life,"" Ricki said. ""He is so funny and so hilarious and happy all the time and loves his fellow man.""
Dustin Draper is Ricki's high school sweetheart. They've been married for 25 years. He's also a Salt Lake County sheriff's deputy and on Sept. 30, he was hospitalized with COVID-19.
The last time Ricki heard him speak was moments before he was intubated on Oct. 10.
His doctor didn't sugarcoat his grave prognosis in discussions with his wife, telling her it was not likely he would survive.
""You can't even describe the gut-wrenching, heart-wrenching, soul-eating feelings that you have hearing that your husband may not walk out of there,"" she said.
In what Ricki calls a miracle, his condition started to improve. During an interview on Oct. 22, she was hopeful. For the first time, his doctor was talking about the future.
But she was also grappling with feelings of regret. After waiting for months, the couple had decided to get vaccinated for COVID-19, but they both contracted COVID before their vaccine appointments.
Her symptoms were significantly milder than his, and she recovered.
""Had we gotten them before,"" she said, ""I don't know if he would be where he is now.""
Sobering statistics
Dustin Draper is facing a disease that's claimed the lives of too many like him before.
The Officers Down Memorial Page, a national organization tracking law enforcement deaths across the country, reports more than 500 line-of-duty deaths attributed to COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic.
One Utahn is included in the count: officer J. Adam Ashworth, a member of the St. George Police Department, who died of COVID-19 in July.
According to the site, COVID-19 deaths account for roughly 65% of line-of-duty deaths in 2020 and 2021 and represent five times the number of line-of-duty deaths caused by gunfire.
""It's a crazy and sobering stat,"" said Brent Jex, president of Utah's Fraternal Order of Police.
Even so, Jex acknowledges resistance to COVID-19 health safety measures among some in the profession.
""It is as complicated an issue in law enforcement than I think I've ever seen,"" he said.
Utah law enforcement
Hoping to understand the practices, resources and attitudes relating to COVID-19 safety measures among Utah law enforcement, KSL investigators sent out an anonymous, statewide survey in October.
Of the 340 members of law enforcement who responded, 64% said they are fully vaccinated.
The approximately one-third who are not pointed to varied reasons, including ""Had COVID-19 and should be immune"" (22%), ""Don't trust the COVID-19 vaccines"" (17%) and ""Concerned about side effects"" (14%).
Of the officers surveyed, 14% said they knew someone in law enforcement who has died due to COVID-19 and 62% said they know an officer who has been hospitalized.
While 85% said they interact with members of the public daily, more than half (54%) said they rarely or never wear a mask when doing so.
A majority (76%) said they would not support a workplace mask requirement and 78% said they would not support a vaccine requirement, with 42% indicating they would quit if their employer mandated vaccines.
One of the survey questions asked unvaccinated respondents whether there is anything their employer could do to change their minds. A majority said 'no,' but some signaled concerns over side effects could be overcome with considerable monetary incentives.
Here are some of the responses:
- ""No. I believe in personal freedoms. I swore an oath to protect them. Why would I want the entity I work for to take them away from me?""
- ""Offer to cover me, or pay a settlement if the vaccine has any side effects.""
- ""If it was mandated, I would do it to keep my job.""
- ""No, not at this time is there anything that would change my choice on this vaccine.""
- ""If they financially incentivized it enough to outweigh the my (sic) concerns about the risks.""
- ""Guarantee me or my family extra compensation if I become ill or extra side effect (sic) from the shot, short term or long term.""
- ""Maybe give me a million dollars.""
- ""Threaten to fire me. However, I do not believe ANY employer should be able to dictate to an employee ANY medical procedure against their will.""
- ""I am vaccinated. I made the decision after speaking with my doctor and whole heartedly believe it is a personal decision and my employer has no business asking or knowing if I am vaccinated or not.""
Another open-ended survey question invited participants to share additional comments they feel should be included in a conversation regarding COVID-19 vaccinations and health safety measures in law enforcement.
Several responses emphasized concerns about personal choice and freedom.
""We are trusted in the most critical of circumstances, we should also be entrusted to make this decision as well,"" one participant wrote.
Some of the written answers minimized the risk of contracting COVID-19, expressing a belief that the pandemic has been overblown and is a hoax.
While another law enforcement officer wrote, ""For a bunch of people who know how government works, and who are so fact-oriented, it blows my mind that some cops aren't getting the vaccine … If you don't trust countless doctors and scientists, how do you expect anyone to trust you?""
By nature, Jex says law enforcement professionals are more likely to take a wait-and-see approach.
""When there's rapidly changing information, that's where cops traditionally will step back and go, 'We're gonna let this play out,'"" he said.
Pandemic policies
KSL investigators also sent out a survey to 40 of the largest law enforcement agencies in Utah and 35 responded.
The data, which was collected during the months of September and October, shows most departments don't know how many or which of their employees are vaccinated and do not have strict masking policies.
Just over one-third (37%) of the departments reported having some version of a mask policy in place. Most of those policies are location-specific, applying only inside city or county buildings, corrections facilities, and courts.
The West Jordan Police Department is the only agency surveyed that said it has a vaccine policy in place. Officers who want to travel out of state for training courses are required to be vaccinated for COVID-19. Otherwise, officers are not required to be vaccinated or report their vaccination status.
Some departments reported they've strongly encouraged vaccinations, held free vaccine clinics and offered incentives, such as a day off.
Only seven agencies, or 20% of those that responded, are tracking vaccinations through voluntary reporting while 80% listed their department's vaccination rate as unknown.
Jex, who is vaccinated, said the FOP has strongly encouraged members to get vaccinated for COVID-19 but is opposed to vaccine mandates.
""We feel comfortable with the position of encouraging it for those whose doctors recommend it,"" he said.
While he's heard from officers who are worried vaccines might become a condition of employment, Jex said so far, it appears Utah law enforcement agencies are holding off on mandates. He doesn't know of a single agency with a department-wide vaccine requirement.
""There's a better way to do things,"" he said. ""And the forced way has never been the good way.""
'A fairly obvious solution'
The Salt Lake City Police Department did track vaccinations early on and is widely viewed as a vaccination success story in the Utah law enforcement community.
Research published in the international journal Police Practice & Research used daily infection case data from the Salt Lake City Police Department from March 9, 2020, through Feb. 12, 2021, to analyze the effectiveness of the department's vaccination program in reducing the spread of COVID-19.
The report states more than 70% of the department's employees received a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine during a four-day period in January 2020.
Immediately after vaccinations, the infection data showed a swift decline. Within weeks, the article states the seven-day rolling average infection rate per 100 employees hit zero.
""While this may seem to be a fairly obvious solution to the problems the pandemic is causing law enforcement agencies, we hope that empirically documenting this result within a police agency will (1) help encourage officers in other agencies to get vaccinated, and (2) support agencies in making intensive efforts to boost staff vaccination rates,"" the article states.
The research and analysis project were completed by Salt Lake City Deputy Chief Scott Mourtgos and Ian Adams, executive director of the Utah FOP.
""Our officers have stepped up,"" said Mike Brown, chief of Salt Lake City Police.
Brown attributes the department's vaccination success to clear communication from department leadership from the start of the pandemic and partnering with public health officials to provide officers with facts and answer their questions.
""Answering those questions 'why,'"" said Brown. ""Why this is important, why it's important to you and your family, and then second, why it's important to your co-workers.""
Like many other departments, Salt Lake is not currently requiring officers to report their vaccination status and Brown said he does not anticipate that will change.
Personal choice and privacy
In West Jordan, the vaccination rate among police officers is unknown.
""I know there are officers who prefer not to get the vaccine and I know plenty who were excited to get the vaccine,"" said West Jordan Sgt. Andrew Hercules.
Hercules chose to get vaccinated as soon as he had the opportunity.
""I remember having a little turmoil over it,"" he said, ""but I was happy that I did it.""
He said increased calls in West Jordan, staffing shortages and COVID-19 infections among officers – including breakthrough infections – have put a strain on his department.
""It does hurt our shifts when we have an officer who gets COVID-19 and has to be out,"" he said.
While the department only mandates masks in court, Hercules said a department expectation of officers is that they will wear a mask if someone they're interacting with asks them to.
Other departments have said the same – officers are expected to respect the masking and distancing wishes of members of the public when it's reasonable and safe to do so.
The Summit County Sheriff's Office is also not requiring employees to report their vaccination status but estimates between 70% and 80% of them have been vaccinated.
Lt. Andrew Wright called the feat ""a pretty big deal.""
The recipe for employee buy-in, Wright said, included strong leadership, clear communication and public health education from sources deputies could trust.
""What the sheriff specifically did is just share the information and let people make that decision based off of their circumstances,"" he said.
While one employee's health decision could impact others and the public, Wright said the department's approach has leaned heavily toward respecting personal privacy.
""I'm vaccinated,"" Wright said, explaining he put all his trust in the health care system and scientists. ""I could walk into our office today and have no idea if someone is vaccinated or not because we didn't track that, we didn't write it down. It's none of our business.""
The approach seems to have worked well for his department, but for others with lagging vaccination rates, Wright said doing more to protect officers gets complicated.
""It is a very fine balance,"" he said. ""No one wants to be told what to do, especially by the government … they want to have the ability to make decisions for themselves, especially when it comes to their own well-being.""
Exemptions
Next to personal freedom, one of the most common reasons given for objecting to vaccine mandates is consideration for people who say they cannot get vaccinated due to medical and religious reasons.
But out of the 117 unvaccinated officers who responded to the KSL survey, only four cited a religious exemption. Even fewer – just two – cited a medical exemption.
Jex said he does believe the discussion surrounding vaccines has become politicized and emotionally charged to a point that people are basing their decision on factors other than whether the vaccine will protect them from serious illness and death due to COVID-19.
""The truthfulness has been lost in the noise,"" he said. ""And our tolerance for it is shaken.""
'It's time'
That noise played into the Drapers' delay in getting vaccinated. Dustin Draper was ready, but Ricki was not.
""I truly was just a little reluctant, just because of all the things that you hear out there,"" she said. ""… but him in true fashion said, 'You know, solidarity. I will wait for you.' And I will always carry that guilt with me, that I didn't trust him and didn't trust the science to go and get the vaccine when we could have.""
Paper hearts peppered the entryway of the Draper's home with encouraging words and positive affirmations last month. It's one of the many ways Ricki Draper said her friends, family and law enforcement community have rallied around her with support.
When asked how she would advise other families holding off on getting vaccinated, she said she still values other people's beliefs.
""For me and my family, like I said, I just needed to trust the science. I needed to trust the medical professionals. That was the right thing to do,"" she said. ""And I know there are others out there that are kind of on the fence with it and stuff, but if you're on the fence at all, I would say it's time. It's time to get the vaccine just to protect your family, you know, and not be in the situation that we are today.""
Dustin Draper's struggle to recover during the last several weeks has been full of ups and downs that Ricki Draper chronicles in daily posts on Facebook, hoping for the day he is conscious again and able to return home.",2021-11-10T00:00:00Z,2021,4,24

FRANKFURT, Germany — The holiday tree is towering over the main square in this central German city, the chestnuts and sugared almonds are roasted, and kids are clambering aboard the merry-go-round just like they did before the pandemic. But a surge in coronavirus infections has left an uneasy feeling hanging over Frankfurt's Christmas market.
To savor a mug of mulled wine — an uncomplicated rite of winter in pre-pandemic times — masked customers must pass through a one-way entrance to a fenced-off wine hut, stopping at the hand sanitizer station. Elsewhere, security officers check vaccination certificates before letting customers head for the steaming sausages and kebabs.
Despite the pandemic inconveniences, stall owners selling ornaments, roasted chestnuts and other holiday-themed items in Frankfurt and other European cities are relieved to be open at all for their first Christmas market in two years, especially with new restrictions taking effect in Germany, Austria and other countries as COVID-19 infections hit record highs. Merchants who have opened are hoping for at least a fraction of the pre-pandemic holiday sales that can make or break their businesses.
Others aren't so lucky. Many of the famous holiday events have been canceled in Germany and Austria. With the market closures goes the money that tourists would spend in restaurants, hotels and other businesses.
Jens Knauer, who crafts intricate, lighted Christmas-themed silhouettes that people can hang in windows, said his hope was simply that the Frankfurt market ""stays open as long as possible.""
While Christmas is 40% of annual revenue for many retailers and restaurateurs, ""with me, it's 100%,"" Knauer said. ""If I can stay open for three weeks, I can make it through the year.""
Purveyors are on edge after other Christmas markets were abruptly shut down in Germany's Bavaria region, which includes Nuremberg, home of one of the biggest and best-known markets. Stunned exhibitors in Dresden had to pack up their goods when authorities in the eastern Saxony region suddenly imposed new restrictions amid soaring infections. Austria's markets closed as a 10-day lockdown began Monday, with many stall owners hoping they can reopen if it's not extended. The Czech government on Thursday closed Christmas markets as part of measures to counter a record surge in cases.
Markets usually attract elbow-to-elbow crowds to row upon row of ornament and food sellers, foot traffic that spills over into revenue for surrounding hotels and restaurants. This year, the crowds at Frankfurt's market were vastly thinned out, with the stalls spread out over a larger area.
Heiner Roie, who runs a mulled wine hut in the shape of a wine barrel, said he's assuming he will see half the business he had in 2019. A shutdown would cause ""immense financial damage — it could lead to complete ruin since we haven't made any income in two years, and at some point, the financial reserves are used up.""
But if people have a little discipline and observe the health measures, ""I think we'll manage it,"" he said.
Next door, Bettina Roie's guests are greeted with a sign asking them to show their vaccination certificates at her stand serving Swiss raclette, a popular melted cheese dish.
The market ""has a good concept because what we need is space, room, to keep some distance from each other,"" she said. ""In contrast to a bricks-and-mortar restaurant, they have their building and their walls, but we can adjust ourselves to the circumstances.""
The extended Roie family is a fifth-generation exhibitor business that also operates the merry-go-round on Frankfurt's central Roemerberg square, where the market opened Monday.
Roie said it was important to reopen ""so that we can bring the people even during the pandemic a little joy — that's what we do, we bring back joy.""
The latest spike in COVID-19 cases has unsettled prospects for Europe's economic recovery, leading some economists to hedge their expectations for growth in the final months of the year.
Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank in London, has cut his forecast for the last three months of the year in the 19 countries that use the euro from 0.7% to 0.5%. But he noted that the wave of infections is having less impact across the broad economy because vaccinations have reduced serious illnesses and many companies have learned to adjust.
That is cold comfort to Germany's DEHOGA restaurant and hotel association, which warned of a ""hail of cancellations"" and said members were reporting every second Christmas party or other special event was being called off.
Other European countries where the pandemic isn't hitting as hard are returning to old ways. The traditional Christmas market in Madrid's Plaza Mayor, in the heart of the Spanish capital, is slated to open Friday at the size it was before the pandemic.
It will have 104 stalls of nativity figures, decorations and traditional sweets in a country where 89% of those 12 or older are fully vaccinated. Last year, it had half the number of stalls and restricted the number of people allowed in the square. Masks and social distancing will remain mandatory, organizers said.
In Hungary's capital of Budapest, Christmas markets have been fenced off and visitors must show proof of vaccination to enter.
Gyorgy Nagy, a producer and seller of handmade glazed crockery, said the restrictions initially stirred worries of fewer shoppers. But business has been good so far.
""I don't think the fence is bad,"" he said. ""At the beginning, we were scared of it, really scared, but I think it's fine. ... I don't think it will be a disadvantage.""
Markets opening reflects a broader spectrum of loose restrictions in Hungary, even as new COVID-19 cases have exceeded peaks seen during a devastating surge last spring. More infections were confirmed last week than in any other week since the pandemic started.
A representative for the Advent Bazilika Christmas market said a number of its measures go beyond government requirements, including that all vendors wear masks and those selling food and drinks be vaccinated.
Bea Lakatos, a seller of fragrant soaps and oils at the Budapest market, said that while sales have been a bit weaker than before the pandemic, ""I wasn't expecting so many foreign visitors given the restrictions.""
""I think things aren't that bad so far,"" she said this week. ""The weekend started particularly strong.""
In Vienna, markets were packed last weekend as people sought some Christmas cheer before Austria's lockdown. Merchants say closures last year and the new restrictions have had disastrous consequences.
""The main sales for the whole year are made at the Christmas markets — this pause is a huge financial loss,"" said Laura Brechmann who sold illuminated stars at the Spittelberg market before the lockdown began. ""We hope things will reopen, but I personally don't really expect it.""
In Austria's Salzkammergut region, home to ski resorts and the picturesque town of Hallstatt, the tourism industry hopes the national lockdown won't be extended past Dec. 13 and it can recover some much-needed revenue.
Last winter's extended lockdowns cost the tourism board alone 1 million euros ($1.12 million) just in nightly tourist tax fees during that period — not to mention the huge financial losses sustained by hotels, restaurants and ski resorts.
""Overall, I do think that if things open up again before Christmas, we can save the winter season,"" said Christian Schirlbauer, head of tourism for the Dachstein-Salzkammergut region. ""But it will depend on whether or not the case numbers go down.""",2021-11-27T00:00:00Z,2021,4,24

Four years ago, the Pac-12's coaching carousel spun at a rate rarely seen in conference history.
Five teams changed head coaches, a vertiginous stretch that began with Gary Andersen quitting on Oregon State in October and ended with Kevin Sumlin taking the Arizona job in January.
This year could make the 2017 cycle look like amateur hour.
It's not difficult to envision five coaching vacancies, and we can get to six or seven without much stretching of the imagination.
Here's our view of the landscape, from the perspective of maximum tumult:
Vacancy No. 1
Team: USC
Coach: Vacant
Seat heat: N/A
What happened: The Trojans fired Clay Helton on Sept. 13, following a blowout home loss to Stanford, because expectations for the program ""would not be met without a change in leadership,"" according to athletic director Mike Bohn.
What's next: A quiet search is ongoing, with USC expected to make a hire in the first half of December. In our view, Cincinnati's Luke Fickell (hired by Bohn at UC) and Baylor's Dave Aranda (from Southern California) are two names to monitor. Others will surface as December approaches, but be careful what you believe — there will be plenty of smoke.
Chance of a vacancy: 100%
Vacancy No. 2
Team: Washington State
Coach: Vacant
Seat heat: N/A
What happened: WSU dismissed Nick Rolovich on Oct. 18 for failing to comply with the state COVID vaccine mandate. Rolovich refused to get vaccinated, and his request for a religious exemption was denied by the university.
What's next: As with USC, the Cougars are quietly getting organized for the end-of-season drive to identify their preferred candidate(s) and negotiate terms. We expect the vetting and interview process to include questions nobody ever expected to ask. (For example: Do you believe Bill Gates was involved in the manufacturing of the vaccine?) Acting coach Jake Dickert will be a strong candidate if the Cougars play well down the stretch.
Chance of a vacancy: 100%
Vacancy No. 3
Team: Washington
Coach: Jimmy Lake (second year)
Seat heat: Scalding
What happened: Lake has suffered a series of self-inflicted hits, disparaging a peer institution (Oregon) and then striking a player on the sideline Saturday. (In response, the university suspended him for Saturday's date with Arizona State.) Add the Huskies' substandard performance on the field, questionable staff hires and a mystifying decision to punt late in the Oregon game, and Lake's future looks bleak.
What's next: The administration must decide whether to bring Lake back for 2022. Although it's rare for a coach to be terminated after one bad year, Lake's massive missteps last week have resulted in a steep erosion of internal support. The Hotline spent much of the season defending Lake and was against a dismissal barring an unforeseen transgression (NCAA violation, breaking the law, etc). We never envisioned it would take the form of Lake striking a player, but that certainly qualifies — and could lay the legal groundwork for a dismissal. He has embarrassed Washington with actions that call into question his ability to recruit, lead the program and properly represent the university.
Chance of a vacancy: 99%
Vacancy No. 4
Team: Arizona State
Coach: Herm Edwards (fourth year)
Seat heat: Hot
What happened: Edwards' future at the helm is in doubt because of an NCAA investigation into recruiting violations during the pandemic. The school already has placed three assistants on paid leave and pulled its chief recruiter off the road. You don't take those steps if the allegations are unfounded.
What's next: The Hotline believes a change in Tempe is likely: Either the 67-year-old Edwards will be forced to resign because of the recruiting violations, or he'll decide enough is enough and retire after four years, one pandemic and several unseemly allegations against his program. The prospect of departing before the NCAA rules on the case could be appealing. If Edwards is long gone when the hammer falls, the damage to his personal reputation — not to mention the sanctions against the school — might not be as severe.
Chance of a vacancy: 75%
Vacancy No. 5
Team: UCLA
Coach: Chip Kelly (fourth year)
Seat heat: Toasty
What happened: Chip Kelly's tenure has reached the tipping point after three-and-a-half disappointing seasons. The Bruins are 13-18 in conference play, have yet to reach the postseason and are facing the distinct possibility of a fully tuned-out fan base in 2022, when they have eight home games (including USC, Utah and Washington) and a chance for significant revenue generation.
What's next: The last three games could be decisive. UCLA is 5-4 overall and 3-3 in conference play. All three are winnable: Colorado and Cal at home and USC on the road. With a sweep, the administration could point to an 8-4 record (and high-end Pac-12 bowl berth) as real progress and justification for Kelly's return in '22. If the Bruins falter, a change might follow. The problem is Kelly's $9 million buyout. It drops to zero, but not until the middle of January.
Chance of a vacancy: 50%
Vacancy No. 6
Team: Cal
Coach: Justin Wilcox (fifth year)
Seat heat: Cool
What happened: The pandemic happened, the City of Berkeley happened and, of course, Cal happened. Wilcox has refrained from speaking his mind publicly, but sources indicate his frustration level has soared in the past week with COVID protocols forcing approximately 30 players and coaches to miss the Arizona game. And there's a good chance the roster depletion will continue this week against USC.
What's next: We wouldn't be surprised if Wilcox decides that he wants to coach for a university that's fully committed to a winning football program. Coaching at Cal is difficult enough when there's no pandemic: The fan passion is low, the admissions bar is high, and the bureaucratic hurdles are ever-present. But add the City of Berkeley's politicized approach to COVID and strict mitigation protocols, and Wilcox must be wondering if high-level football success is possible. His decision could be impacted by the available options. If Washington has an opening and makes an offer, he might bolt. (Also possible: The Huskies pursue Jonathan Smith.)
Chance of a vacancy: 40%
Vacancy No. 7
Team: Utah
Coach: Kyle Whittingham (17th season)
Seat heat: Frigid
What happened: Nothing, and everything. Whittingham is on his way to Utah's third division title in four years. He has endured the death of two players in the past 11 months. He has nothing left to prove and little left to accomplish, save for winning the Pac-12 championship.
What's next: Only Whittingham knows the emotional toll the tragedies have taken on his soon-to-be 62-year-old psyche, but it's clear that he feels a deep bond with this team that won't easily be rekindled in future seasons. A month ago, the Hotline wondered aloud if Whittingham might retire at the end of the season, particularly if he wins the conference championship and leads Utah to the first Rose Bowl in school history. There is nothing tangible to suggest he's even considering retirement. But it can't be completely dismissed until he confirms his return for 2022.
Chance of a vacancy: 10%
Vacancy No. 8
Team: Oregon
Coach: Mario Cristobal (fifth season)
Seat heat: Zero degrees (Kelvin)
What happened: Cristobal keeps winning, and other coaches keep getting fired.
What's next: The Hotline doesn't expect Cristobal to end up at USC, but there's another blue blood opening that might interest him: LSU. If the Ducks don't reach the playoff and the Tigers come calling, could he be tempted? Or might his alma mater, Miami, make a change and make an appeal to his heart?
Chance of vacancy: 1%

NEW YORK — Pfizer on Tuesday said final analysis of its antiviral COVID-19 pill still showed near 90% efficacy in preventing hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients, and recent lab data suggests the drug retains its effectiveness against the fast-spreading omicron variant of the coronavirus.
The U.S. drugmaker last month said the oral medicine was around 89% effective in preventing hospitalizations or deaths when compared to placebo based on interim results in around 1,200 people. The data disclosed on Tuesday includes an additional 1,000 people.
Nobody in the trial who received the Pfizer treatment died, compared with 12 deaths among placebo recipients.
The Pfizer pills are taken with the older antiviral ritonavir every 12 hours for five days beginning shortly after onset of symptoms. If authorized, the treatment will be sold as Paxlovid.
Pfizer also released early data from a second clinical trial showing that the treatment reduced hospitalizations by around 70% in around 600 standard-risk adults.
""It's a stunning outcome,"" Pfizer Chief Scientific Officer Mikael Dolsten said in an interview.
""We're talking about a staggering number of lives saved and hospitalizations prevented. And of course, if you deploy this quickly after infection, we are likely to reduce transmission dramatically,"" Dolsten said.
We're talking about a staggering number of lives saved and hospitalizations prevented. And of course, if you deploy this quickly after infection, we are likely to reduce transmission dramatically.
–Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer chief scientific officer
Dolsten said he expects authorization for use in high-risk individuals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies soon. He does not believe an FDA advisory panel meeting will be needed.
""We're in very advanced regulatory dialogues with both Europe and the UK, and we have dialogues with most of the major regulatory agencies globally,"" Dolsten said.
The efficacy of Pfizer's pill in preventing hospitalizations and deaths in at-risk patients was widely expected, so the FDA's decision could come within a matter of weeks, if not days, said Zarina Saidova, an analyst at Moscow-based Finam Holdings.
Saidova expects Paxlovid to generate $15 billion to $20 billion in revenue next year, a significant boost for the company in the face of a potential decline in vaccine sales.
There are currently no oral antiviral treatments for COVID-9 authorized in the United States.
Rival Merck has asked for emergency use authorization of its antiviral pill molnupiravir. But that drug only reduced hospitalizations and deaths in its clinical trial of high-risk patients by around 30%.
Some scientists have also raised safety concerns about the potential for birth defects from the Merck drug, as well as worries that it could cause the virus to mutate.
Related:
Pfizer's drug works differently. It is part of a class of drugs called protease inhibitors currently used to treat HIV, hepatitis C and other viruses.
Pfizer shares fell 0.8% to $54.75 in trading before the bell, while Merck shares were flat at $72.69
Dolsten said recent laboratory testing showed that activity against the protease of the omicron variant is as ""good as basically any SARS-COV-2 variant of concern.""
The company has said it can have 180,000 treatment courses ready to ship this year and plans to produce at least 80 million more in 2022.
Dolsten said Pfizer is looking to expand that output further as new variants, like the newly discovered omicron, could push the need for antivirals substantially higher. Current vaccines appear to be less effective at preventing infection with omicron.
Pfizer, which makes one of the leading COVID-19 vaccines with German partner BioNTech, has agreed to allow generic manufacturers to supply versions of the drug to 95 low- and middle-income countries through a licensing agreement with international public health group Medicines Patent Pool (MPP). However, Dolsten said that for next year he expects the drug will be mainly produced by Pfizer.
The U.S. government has already secured 10 million courses of the Pfizer drug for $5.29 billion.",2021-12-14T00:00:00Z,2021,4,24

SALT LAKE CITY — U.S. highways and airports will be back to near pre-pandemic volumes over the busy end-of-year travel season and public health officials are urging safe practices for both the journey and the holiday celebrations as COVID-19 case counts, driven by the omicron variant, continue to surge.
AAA is predicting nearly 110 million U.S. travelers will be heading out of town from Dec. 23 to Jan. 2, exceeding 2020's holiday traffic by almost 28 million and coming up just shy of 2019's pre-pandemic travel flow of 119 million over the same period.
About 6.4 million travelers will get to their holiday destinations via the air. The Salt Lake City International Airport reports it is expecting 25,000-plus departing passengers Wednesday and Thursday, more than double pre-Christmas departures last year.
Travel industry leaders are joining public health experts in imploring all travelers to follow guidance on safe practices and, most importantly, to get vaccinated or boosted.
""With vaccines widely available, conditions are much different and many people feel a greater level of comfort traveling, but travelers will still be mindful of the pandemic and the new omicron variant,"" said Aldo Vazquez, AAA Utah spokesperson.
The COVID-19 omicron variant is now accounting for most of the new infections in the U.S. and experts warn the highly communicable strain will heighten risk of illness for airline travelers.
In Wednesday reporting by The Hill, a leading medical adviser to a group representing nearly 300 airlines said in a new interview that aircraft passengers are two or three times more likely to be infected with COVID-19 on a flight since the emergence of the omicron variant.
""Whatever the risk was with delta, we would have to assume the risk would be two to three times greater with omicron, just as we've seen in other environments,"" Dr. David Powell, physician and medical adviser to the International Air Transport Association, told Bloomberg News.
Related:
He added that ""it's just that the relative risk has probably increased, just as the relative risk of going to the supermarket or catching a bus has increased with omicron.""
Air travelers who choose to stage protests on airplanes or at airport facilities, where masks are required, will be facing zero tolerance responses from security personnel under a no-warning policy the Federal Aviation Administration instituted in January. Incidents that escalate to verbal threats or physical assaults of other passengers or airline employees come with penalties that include fines of up to $35,000 and jail time.
And unruly airline passengers may face additional consequences for bad behavior under a new partnership between the Transportation Security Administration and FAA.
Under the partnership, the FAA will share information of passengers facing fines for unruly behavior with TSA which may remove the passenger from TSA PreCheck screening eligibility, which is a privilege reserved for low-risk travelers, according to a posting on the FAA website.
""TSA has zero tolerance for unruly behaviors, especially those involving physical assault occurring aboard aircraft. We have tremendous respect for airport staff, gate agents and flight crews that get people safely to their destinations,"" said TSA Administrator David Pekoske. ""This partnership with FAA will help ensure the safety and security of all passengers and hold those who violate federal regulations accountable for their actions.""
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that the best way to minimize COVID-19 risk and keep family members and friends safe is to get vaccinated if you're eligible.
The CDC also posted this list of guidelines ahead of 2021 holiday travel and celebrations:
- Get a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as you can. Find a vaccine.
- Wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth to help protect yourself and others.
- Stay 6 feet apart from others who don't live with you. Avoid crowds and poorly ventilated indoor spaces.
- Test to prevent spread to others.
- Wash your hands often with soap and water. Use hand sanitizer if soap and water aren't available.",2021-12-22T00:00:00Z,2021,4,24

LONDON — The World Health Organization on Wednesday endorsed the world's first malaria vaccine and said it should be given to children across Africa in the hope that it will spur stalled efforts to curb the spread of the parasitic disease.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called it ""a historic moment"" after a meeting in which two of the U.N. health agency's expert advisory groups recommended the step.
""Today's recommendation offers a glimmer of hope for the continent, which shoulders the heaviest burden of the disease. And we expect many more African children to be protected from malaria and grow into healthy adults,"" said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO's Africa director.
WHO said its decision was based largely on results from ongoing research in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi that tracked more than 800,000 children who have received the vaccine since 2019.
The vaccine, known as Mosquirix, was developed by GlaxoSmithKline in 1987. While it's the first to be authorized, it does face challenges: The vaccine is only about 30% effective, it requires up to four doses, and its protection fades after several months.
Still, scientists say the vaccine could have a major impact against malaria in Africa, home to most of the world's more than 200 million cases and 400,000 deaths per year.
""This is a huge step forward,"" said Julian Rayner, director of the Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, who was not part of the WHO decision. ""It's an imperfect vaccine, but it will still stop hundreds of thousands of children from dying.""
Rayner said the vaccine's impact on the spread of the mosquito-borne disease was still unclear, but pointed to those developed for the coronavirus as an encouraging example.
""The last two years have given us a very nuanced understanding of how important vaccines are in saving lives and reducing hospitalizations, even if they don't directly reduce transmission,"" he said.
Dr. Alejandro Cravioto, head of the WHO vaccine group that made the recommendation, said designing a shot against malaria was particularly difficult because it is a parasitic disease spread by mosquitoes.
""We're confronted with extraordinarily complex organisms,"" he said. ""We are not yet in reach of a highly efficacious vaccine, but what we have now is a vaccine that can be deployed and that is safe.""
WHO said side effects were rare, but sometimes included a fever that could result in temporary convulsions.
Sian Clarke, co-director of the Malaria Centre at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the vaccine would be a useful addition to other tools against the disease that might have exhausted their utility after decades of use, like bed nets and insecticides.
""In some countries where it gets really hot, children just sleep outside, so they can't be protected by a bed net,"" Clarke said. ""So obviously if they've been vaccinated, they will still be protected.""
In recent years, little significant progress has been made against malaria, Clarke said.
""If we're going to decrease the disease burden now, we need something else,"" she explained.
Azra Ghani, chair of infectious diseases at Imperial College London, said she and colleagues estimate that giving the malaria vaccine to children in Africa might result in a 30% reduction overall, with up to 8 million fewer cases and as many as 40,000 fewer deaths per year.
""For people not living in malaria countries, a 30% reduction might not sound like much. But for the people living in those areas, malaria is one of their top concerns,"" Ghani said. ""A 30% reduction will save a lot of lives and will save mothers (from) bringing in their children to health centers and swamping the health system.""
The WHO guidance would hopefully be a ""first step"" to making better malaria vaccines, she said. Efforts to produce a second-generation malaria vaccine might be given a boost by the messenger RNA technology used to make two of the most successful COVID-19 vaccines, those from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, she added.
""We've seen much higher antibody levels from the mRNA vaccines, and they can also be adapted very quickly,"" Ghani said, noting that BioNTech recently said it would begin researching a possible malaria shot. ""It's impossible to say how that may affect a malaria vaccine, but we definitely need new options to fight it.""",2021-10-06T00:00:00Z,2021,4,24

NEW YORK — Santa is back this year, but he pleads caution as he continues to tiptoe through the pandemic.
""Be smart. Be caring. If you have the tiniest tickle in your throat, the tiniest feeling, worry about yourself and worry about everybody else, and know Santa will always be there next year,"" said 57-year-old Kevin Chesney, who's been donning the big red suit since he was a kid.
Amid a downturn in Jolly Old Elves — about 15 percent fewer in one large database — Chesney is busier than ever from his North Pole in Moorestown, New Jersey. The photo studio where he works quickly sold out its 4,500 appointments to sit with him and the seven other Santas in the studio's stable.
They're among the brave in Santa's ranks with full-contact visits, lap sitting included, though Chesney wears a mask until just before the photos are taken.
Other Santas might not be wearing masks or plastic face shields, or hanging out in protective snow globes like many did last year, but it seems 50-50 this season that they're not quite ready for hugs, whispers in their ears for secret wishes, and kids smiling or sobbing on their knees.
Some Santas will remain behind barriers that popped up last year for safety. At Minnesota's Mall of America, the big man will be housed in a log cabin behind a window with guests seated on benches in front of him. At 169 locations for the outdoor retailers Bass Pro Shops and Cabela's, benches will also be used, with plastic partitions deployed at some stores for Santa's photo ops.
Other retailers and Santa hosts are offering the option of no or full contact, even when mandates to distance aren't in place. And many require or encourage reservations online to cut down on the number of people waiting.
More than 10 million U.S. households visited Santa in a mall or store in 2019, according to GlobalData Retail's managing director, Neil Saunders. Nearly 73% of them also spent money at nearby restaurants or stores, he said. Last year, the company's research found that 6.1 million households visited Santa, with fewer retailers and malls offering the holiday star in person. Of those visitors, 62% ate or shopped nearby.
Saunders said projections this year have about 8.9 million households expected to visit Santa in person, with virtual visits still a big option.
""Lingering concerns about the virus and ongoing restrictions in some states and localities continue to act as a brake on visiting Santa in person,"" he said.
Chris Landtroop, a spokeswoman for Santa vendor Cherry Hill Programs, is optimistic. The new rollout of vaccinations for children 5 to 11 will certainly help.
""Santa is so back and we are super excited about that. Last year was incredibly tough,"" Landtroop said.
The company has been sourcing Santas all year for the 800 malls, big-box stores and other locations it serves, with options for no-contact visits, too. Cherry Hill requires its Santas and other employees to be vaccinated and those with exemptions to be tested regularly.
""At the end of the day, we want guests to feel comfortable,"" Landtroop said.
Luther Landon has been providing the Santa Experience at Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, for nearly two decades. Last year, he hit on the log cabin idea but was shut down after a day due to the pandemic. He pivoted to virtual Santa and this year will offer both.
""We think that it would be very irresponsible of us to just ignore it and pretend like everything's back to normal,"" he said of the pandemic. ""We've hidden some microphones so Santa can hear just fine. I know from our Santa community and knowing so many other Santas that the majority of them are reluctant, highly reluctant, to go back to the way it was before the pandemic. But we also have some who are just like, you know what, I don't care. Having both of those groups is what's happening in the country, too.""
Russell Hurd in Royse City, Texas, has been playing Santa since 2017, after he retired from the Army. He'll be in his red suit to go with his long — and very real — white beard at the Gaylord Texan Resort & Convention Center near Dallas. His visits with the throngs are distanced and masks are required. He longs for that to end.
""The way it used to be, it's meaningful for us Santas, too. I mean, we're human beings. We crave that interaction, but for now we do what we can,"" Hurd said.
Hurd is unvaccinated and tests regularly for COVID-19.
""I know a lot of unvaxxed Santas across the country. I mean, it's not just Texas,"" he said.
Count American Dream, a mega mall of 3 million square feet in East Rutherford, New Jersey, is among retailers offering distanced Santa. He'll be on ice, skating the indoor rink with visitors, and also tooling around with guests in hot pink golf carts.
At Macy's stores, Santa will be making his list and checking it twice from behind a desk, with guests seated on the other side.
""We're encouraging everyone to maintain masking throughout their visits,"" said Kathleen Wright, senior manager at Macy's Branded Entertainment. ""Santa has been a part of the Macy's tradition since 1862 so we're overjoyed that we can safely continue the tradition this year.""
At Oakbrook Center, a mall in suburban Chicago owned by Brookfield Properties, Santa's spot is a tricked-out motorhome with his fans allowed inside. Santa will be happening at 117 of 132 malls Brookfield owns in 43 states. The company is following local mandates on safety protocols but will distance anyone who asks. The same goes for CBL Properties, which owns 63 malls in 24 states and offered Santa visits from a safe distance last year.
""We're bringing back a more traditional Santa experience this year,"" said CBL spokeswoman Stacey Keating. ""Visitors who wish to do so will be able to sit on Santa's lap or on Santa's bench. Masks will not be required at the set or during photos unless there's a local mandate in place.""
And, bonus: ""We're also bringing back pet photo nights with Santa,"" she said, ""as well as Santa Cares, a reservation-only event that caters to those with sensory sensitivities and for whom the traditional experience may be too overwhelming.""
The pandemic has taken its toll on Santa in other ways.
Stephen Arnold, the 71-year-old head of IBRBS (formerly the International Brotherhood of Real Bearded Santas) said his organization of about 2,000 Santas and Mrs. Clauses has lost 57 Santas to COVID-19.
""Most of us are overweight, diabetic, with heart conditions,"" said Arnold, a long-time Santa working this year both virtually and in person in Memphis, Tennessee. ""I mean, we're prime targets for a disease like COVID.""",2021-11-28T00:00:00Z,2021,4,24

SALT LAKE CITY — Utah health officials reported 920 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, as well as 12 new deaths.
School-age children represented 148 of the new cases — 64 of those were ages 5-10, 43 were 11-13, and 41 were 14-17.
Also on Tuesday, the Salt Lake County Council voted to extend the county's public health emergency declaration related to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is the fifteenth time the council has extended the order, according to the county's records. Council member Dea Theodore was the only member to vote against extending the declaration.
The Salt Lake City Council also extended its mask mandate for K-12 schools in the city through March 25, 2022. Council members voted to extend the mandate at their regular meeting on Tuesday evening.
The rolling, seven-day average for new cases is 1,107 per day, and the average positive rate of those tested is 14%, the Utah Department of Health said. Hospitals were treating 498 patients with the coronavirus, 200 of whom were in intensive care units. Referral ICUs that can treat the most serious patients were 99.3% full, and overall ICU use stood at 97.1%.
Now, 614,270 cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed in the state, as well as 3,673 deaths due to the resulting disease, COVID-19. Utah's death rate for people who have tested positive for the disease is about 0.6%, and the COVID-19 death rate out of Utah's total population is about 0.11%, according to health department data.
While hospital officials have noted that Utah has seen a surge this winter similar to last year, the state was actually faring worse one year ago, more than a week ahead of Christmas. On Dec. 14, 2020 — just before the vaccine rollout began — Utah's rolling, seven-day average stood at 2,598 new cases per day, data shows. At that time, 572 patients were hospitalized with COVID-19 and the state had confirmed a total of 235,872 cases.
In the last 28 days, unvaccinated residents have seen 14.6 times greater risk of dying from COVID-19, 9.3 times greater risk of hospitalization, and 3.6 times greater risk of testing positive for COVID-19 than vaccinated people, the state health department said.
Since Feb. 1, unvaccinated residents have experienced 6.7 times greater risk of dying from the coronavirus, 5.6 times greater risk of hospitalization, and 2.5 times greater risk of testing positive for the disease than vaccinated people, according to the data.
Of the cases reported Tuesday, 329 were ""breakthrough,"" meaning they occurred in patients who were fully vaccinated (having received more than one dose of both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, and one dose of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine) more than two weeks before testing positive with the disease. Four of the deaths reported on Tuesday were also breakthroughs. Now 54,241 breakthrough cases and 326 breakthrough deaths have been confirmed in Utah since vaccines became available to the public early this year.
Five of the deaths reported Tuesday occurred before mid-November. The remainder of deaths include:
- A Washington County man between the ages of 65 and 84, who was hospitalized when he died.
- A Davis County woman, 65-84, long-term care facility resident.
- A Utah County woman, 45-64, hospitalized.
- A Washington County man, 45-64, hospitalized.
- A Salt Lake County man, 45-64, hospitalized.
- A Utah County man, 45-64, not hospitalized.
- A Salt Lake County woman, 45-64, long-term care facility resident.
- A Weber County woman, older than 85, long-term care facility resident.
- A Salt Lake County woman, older than 85, long-term care facility resident.
- A Salt Lake County woman, 65-84, long-term care facility resident.
- A Washington County man, 25-44, hospitalized.
- A woman of unknown residence, older than 85, not hospitalized.

Each year, seasonal flu infections cause a variety of symptoms that start suddenly. The flu typically makes you feel rotten for three to five days. However, it can be highly dangerous for young children, older adults, and others with certain health conditions. To protect yourself and your community, you need a flu shot every year.
Here are five things to know about this year's flu season and vaccine.
1. Big differences from last year
Last year, we saw very little influenza in Utah and across the nation. Many of our traditional respiratory viruses seemed absent. This is arguably due to more people receiving the flu vaccine, as well as the social distancing, masking, and other community efforts to prevent spread of COVID.
""Unfortunately, we don't seem to be quite as vigilantly this year,"" said Tamara Sheffield, MD, Intermountain Healthcare medical director for preventive medicine. ""We are already seeing an unusual surge in RSV, a virus that causes respiratory failure in infants and is spread like influenza.""
2. Impact of COVID patients on healthcare resources
Sheffield said many of the resources used in hospitals to care for patients with COVID could be overwhelmed if influenza cases start to fill those beds as well. As hospital capacity is already stretched, Intermountain strongly encourages everyone to receive both the influenza and COVID vaccines.
""We are again facing a flu season while another serious respiratory virus that has very similar symptoms is circulating, namely COVID-19. If a person shows symptoms like fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle or body aches or headache, they are going to need to be tested for both COVID and influenza,"" Sheffield said.
Seasonal flu symptoms usually come on fast, causing chills, fever, muscle aches, tiredness, dry cough, and sore throat. Occasionally, seasonal flu will cause a runny or stuffy nose or, in young children, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
3. Understand how influenza is spread
The flu virus prefers air travel, catching rides on the tiny droplets that fly out when someone sneezes, coughs, sings, or talks. However, it can also stick around on surfaces for several hours. If you touch something that was recently contaminated and then touch your mouth or nose, you can get infected. It is important to note you can spread the virus before you show signs of illness.
4. Find out which influenza vaccine method is best for you
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises everyone ages 6 months and older to receive an annual flu vaccination.
There are several options this year when it comes to your flu vaccine. There is the ""shot"" which is the Quadrivalent regular injectable dose, or for people age 65 years and over, the high dose quadrivalent or adjuvanted vaccine. People ages 2 through 49 years also have the option of the Intranasal or nasal spray vaccine.
The best way to find the vaccine that is right for you is to consult with your doctor or pharmacist.
""Get a seasonal flu vaccination,"" Sheffield advised. ""Everyone in the family over the age of six months should get a vaccine, and so should anyone who is around a baby that is younger than six months.""
5. Take steps to stop the spread of disease
The same prevention methods work for flu and COVID. Wearing a mask does work. Be sure it covers your nose and mouth snuggly.
- Wash your hands often and well, and have children do the same.
- If you're sick, stay home from school, work, or church.
- Avoid close contact with people who are sick, if possible.
- Cover your sneezes and coughs.
- Use a tissue once, then throw it away and wash your hands.

WASHINGTON — Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert who became a household name — and the subject of partisan attacks — during the COVID-19 pandemic, announced Monday he will leave the federal government in December after more than five decades.
Fauci directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden and also leads a lab studying the immune system.
While the COVID-19 pandemic introduced him to millions of Americans, he's given straight-talk to the nation about numerous outbreaks including HIV/AIDS, SARS, pandemic flu, Ebola and the 2001 anthrax attacks.
""I've gone into this campus and into the labs and into the hospital every day, including most weekends, for 54 years. The idea of walking away from it obviously is bittersweet,"" Fauci told The Associated Press.
In announcing his departure, the 81-year-old Fauci called his roles ""the honor of a lifetime"" but said it was time ""to pursue the next chapter of my career.""
Known for his candor and for the ability to translate complex medical information into everyday language, Fauci has been a key adviser to seven presidents starting with Ronald Reagan.
Fauci became the face of the government response to COVID-19 as it hit in early 2020, with frequent appearances on television news and at daily press conferences with White House officials, including then-President Donald Trump. But as the pandemic deepened, Fauci fell out of favor with Trump when his urgings of continued public caution clashed with the former president's desire to return to normalcy and to promote unproven treatments for the virus.
I've gone into this campus and into the labs and into the hospital every day, including most weekends, for 54 years. The idea of walking away from it obviously is bittersweet.
–Dr. Anthony Fauci
Fauci found himself marginalized by the Trump administration, but he continued to speak out publicly in media interviews, advocating social distancing and masks in public settings before the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines.
He was also the subject of political attacks and death threats and was given a security detail for his protection.
When Biden won the White House, he asked Fauci to stay on in his administration in an elevated capacity.
""I've been able to call him at any hour of the day for his advice,"" Biden said in a statement. ""Whether you've met him personally or not, he has touched all Americans' lives with his work. I extend my deepest thanks for his public service. The United States of America is stronger, more resilient, and healthier because of him.""
Fauci said he planned to continue working after leaving the government, saying he wants to use his experience ""to hopefully inspire the younger generation of scientists and would-be scientists"" to consider a career in public service.
For all the rancor of the coronavirus pandemic, it wasn't Fauci's first run-in with an angry public. He became head of the infectious diseases branch of the National Institutes of Health in 1984 when the nation was in the throes of the AIDS crisis. Activists protested what they saw as government indifference and Fauci, frustrated at being unable to save dying patients in the NIH's hospital, brought them to the table in the hunt for treatments.
Later, under President George W. Bush, Fauci helped develop PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, to bring life-saving HIV treatments to developing countries. In 2008, Bush awarded Fauci the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
Fauci said Monday he'd hoped there would be a successful HIV vaccine before he retired, but ""it wasn't for lack of trying"" to overcome extraordinary scientific challenges posed by that virus.
Fast forward to COVID-19, and for many Americans, Fauci has remained a trusted voice even as scientists were surprised again and again by a fast-evolving new virus. The NIH had laid the scientific groundwork for the speedy development of powerful coronavirus vaccines that, while not perfect, are highly effective at preventing serious illness and death.
Fauci told the AP that he remains frustrated at the country's divisions over how to handle the pandemic.
""If ever there was a situation where you wanted a unified approach and everybody pulling together for the common good, it would be when you're in the middle of a public health crisis,"" he said. ""As a physician and a scientist, I and my colleagues have the responsibility to do what's correct, what is science-based.""",2022-08-22T00:00:00Z,2022,3,25

NEW YORK — The Latest on the U.S. Open tennis tournament (all times local):
2:30 a.m.
It's going to be a U.S. Open quarterfinals matchup of two rising stars when third-seeded Carlos Alcaraz plays No. 11-seed Jannik Sinner.
The 19-year-old Alcaraz was the last to advance in one of the longest nights ever at the Open -- that included a fourth set that lasted about an hour -- with a 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 win over 2014 U.S. Open champion Marin Cilic at Arthur Ashe Stadium.
Alcaraz, who can end the Open ranked No. 1 in the world, dropped to his knees when he won the grueling match that lasted 3 hours, 54 minutes and ended at 2:23 a.m. — missing the record by 3 minutes for the latest finish in Open history. He would be the youngest No. 1 on the ATP tour since 2001.
Cilic's exit means there's not a single former U.S. Open champion left in both the men's and women's draw.
Sinner beat Alcaraz in four sets when they played this year at Wimbledon. Sinner, who turned 21 in August, is the youngest player to reach the quarterfinals of all four Grand Slam events in a season since Novak Djokovic was 20 in 2007. The two players could play a pivotal role in a potential changing of the guard in men's tennis. Rafael Nadal lost Monday and Djokovic, who has 21 Grand Slam titles, did not enter this U.S. Open because he is not vaccinated against COVID-19 and was not allowed to enter the United States. Roger Federer, 41, has undergone a series of operations on his right knee and last played at Wimbledon last year.
Alcaraz was already the youngest man to reach the fourth round in consecutive U.S. Open since Pete Sampras in 1989 and '90.
The crowd at Ashe went wild on nearly every point in the fifth set. Alcaraz, of Spain, was fist-pumping and exhorting the fans to get louder. And it worked. Fueled by the fandom -- and a spate of Cilic's unforced errors -- Alcaraz pulled away in the fifth. Alcaraz high-fived a few fans that stuck around to celebrate his second straight quarterfinal berth at Flushing Meadows.

12:10 a.m.
Eleventh-seeded Jannik Sinner held off feisty Ilya Ivashka and won his U.S. Open match 6-1, 5-7, 6-2, 4-6, 6-3 to clinch a spot in all four Grand Slam quarterfinals this year.
Sinner, who turned 21 in August, became the youngest player to reach the quarterfinals of all four Grand Slam events in a season since Novak Djokovic was 20 in 2007. Sinner was down 3-1 in the fifth set but rallied to win five straight games to close out the unseeded Ivashka.
Sinner won 12 break points in the match and dug deep in the fifth, showcasing why the rising Italian is considered as a potential star. Sinner joins Matteo Berrettini as Italian men in the U.S. Open quarterfinals.
Sinner will play the winner of Monday night's final match between 2014 U.S. Open champion Marin Cilic and No. 3 Carlos Alcaraz.

10:20 p.m.
Sixth-seeded Aryna Sabalenka bounced back from a slow start and visits from the trainer to beat No. 19 seed Danielle Collins 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 and reach the U.S. Open quarterfinals.
Sabalenka advanced to face No. 22 Karolina Pliskova.
Sabalenka continued her mastery at Flushing Meadows over Collins, beating her for the third time at the U.S Open (2018 and 2021). She led 4-3 in the second set when she needed a medical timeout. Sabalenka had a trainer massage her left thigh and it continued throughout breaks in the match. Sabalenka, an Open semifinalist in 2021, said at her on-court interview she was fine.
Sabalenka at one point complained to the chair umpire about fan noise — and again, there were plenty of them inside Arthur Ashe Stadium. The U.S. Open has attracted a record 549,657 fans since the main draw started last Monday. It's the highest-ever attendance for the tournament through its first eight days. The previous record was 540,333, set in 2019.
She even changed her racket — which she said was ""super loose"" — in the midst of the second set. It didn't bother her too much. She had 38 winners.
Sabalenka, who is from Belarus, was not allowed to play at Wimbledon this year after all players from her country and Russia were banned because of the invasion of Ukraine.
___
8 p.m.
No. 24 seed Karolina Pliskova has moved into the U.S. Open quarterfinals with a 7-5, 6-7 (5), 6-2 win over 26th-seeded Victoria Azarenka.
Pliskova, a former world No. 1, was the runner-up at the U.S. Open in 2016 and at Wimbledon in 2021. Pliskova will play the winner of Monday night's match at Arthur Ashe Stadium between No. 6 seed Aryna Sabalenka and 19th-seeded Danielle Collins.
The women's field is guaranteed to have a first-time champion.
Pliskova has returned to form in Flushing Meadows after a broken right wrist forced her to miss the Australian Open and she struggled in her first few tournaments when she returned to action.
Azarenka lost for the fifth time in nine career meetings against Pliskova.
___
6:15 p.m.
Frances Tiafoe pulled off the biggest win of his career when the 22nd-ranked American beat second-seeded Rafael Nadal 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 to reach the U.S. Open quarterfinals.
Tiafoe buried his head in his hands and cried on the court after he shook hands with Nadal. He sat on the bench and buried his head in a towel as Nadal walked off and waved to the crowd.
The 24-year-old Tiafoe is the youngest American to reach the quarterfinals since Andy Roddick did so at 24 in 2006. Nadal, a four-time U.S. Open champion, was the highest-seeded player left after No. 1 Daniil Medvedev lost Sunday.
Tiafoe already was the first American man to reach the fourth round in three straight years since Mardy Fish in 2010-12.
Nadal entered 22-0 at Grand Slam events in 2022. He was 21-1 against Americans since October 2017, which included straight-set wins over Tiafoe in the 2019 Australian Open quarterfinals and 2019 Madrid third round.
The early edge was a boon for Tiafoe. Nadal has never come back from down 2-1 at the U.S. Open and fell to 0-7 overall at Flushing Meadows with that deficit.
___
4:35 p.m.
No. 1 seed Iga Swiatek survived a slow start to knock off unseeded Jule Niemeier 2-6, 6-4, 6-0 to reach the quarterfinals at the U.S. Open for the first time.
Swiatek, a two-time French Open champion, will play Jessica Pegula next. Pegula eliminated two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova 6-3, 6-2 to get to her third major quarterfinal of 2022.
Swiatek came into the U.S. Open just 4-4 in her last eight matches after winning 37 straight, but she hadn't lost a set at Flushing Meadows until Monday. Niemeier got the early jump — as she exhorted the crowd to get louder — and gamely tried for another Grand Slam upset. She knocked out No. 2 seed Anett Kontaveit in Wimbledon.
Swiatek steadied herself in the second set and hit 10 winners, and she turned the third set into a rout. Swiatek became the first Polish woman to reach the quarterfinals at the U.S. Open and is trying to become the first top-seeded woman to win it since Serena Williams in 2014.
___
2:15 p.m.
Jessica Pegula eliminated two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova 6-3, 6-2 to get to her third major quarterfinal of 2022 and reach that round for the first time at Flushing Meadows.
Play was held up for about 45 minutes at 1-1 in the first set while rain fell. There is a retractable roof at Arthur Ashe Stadium, but it wasn't closed until after a downpour soaked the court.
The U.S. Tennis Association said in a statement that its ""weather team"" told U.S. Open organizers there was no rain expected. The statement added: ""Unfortunately, a pop-up sunshower occurred.""
The No. 8-seeded Pegula is the highest-ranked American woman and the only player in the top 10 in both singles and doubles.
She reeled off the last three games of Monday's opening set, which ended with a double-fault by No. 21 Kvitova, and then the last six games of the fourth-round match after trailing 2-0 in the second set.
Pegula is a 28-year-old who was born in New York. Her parents own the NFL's Buffalo Bills and NHL's Buffalo Sabres.
She is 0-3 in Grand Slam quarterfinals so far, including losses at that stage at the Australian Open in January and the French Open in June. The loss in Paris came against No. 1-ranked Iga Swiatek, who could be Pegula's next opponent at Flushing Meadows.
___
1:40 p.m.
Andrey Rublev reached his sixth Grand Slam quarterfinal by beating Cam Norrie 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 in a match delayed by about 25 minutes while the retractable roof at Louis Armstrong Stadium remained open during a downpour.
The No. 9-seeded Rublev is into his third quarterfinal at Flushing Meadows. But he is 0-2 at that stage in New York — and 0-5 at all majors.
Rublev next faces 22-time Grand Slam champion Rafael Nadal or 24-year-old American Frances Tiafoe, who were scheduled to meet later Monday.
No. 7 Norrie was trying to reach the second Grand Slam quarterfinal of his career — and of this year. He lost in the Wimbledon semifinals to eventual champion Novak Djokovic in July.
___
1:15 p.m.
Play has resumed between two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova and No. 8 seed Jessica Pegula in Arthur Ashe Stadium after a rain delay of 45 minutes while they waited for the retractable roof to close and the court to be dried.
The fourth-round match was halted in the middle of the third game with the score at 1-all.
Action also returned at Louis Armstrong Stadium between No. 7 Cam Norrie and No. 9 Andrey Rublev after a delay of just under 25 minutes.
Shortly after they picked back up, Rublev closed out the second set for a 6-4, 6-4 lead in their fourth-round contest.
No other courts at Flushing Meadows have a roof, so play is suspended in doubles and junior matches.
___
12:45 p.m.
Rain is delaying play in all matches at Flushing Meadows — even in the two arenas with retractable roofs, Arthur Ashe Stadium and Louis Armstrong Stadium.
The courts were not covered when a little drizzle became a heavy downpour.
The match in Ashe between two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova and No. 8 seed Jessica Pegula was in the middle of the third game with the score at 1-all.
The match in Armstrong between No. 7 Cam Norrie and No. 9 Andrey Rublev was in the third set with Rublev up a set and a break at 6-4, 4-3.
___
11:15 a.m.
Play has started on Day 8 at Flushing Meadows, with No. 7 seed Cam Norrie facing No. 9 Andrey Rublev in Louis Armstrong Stadium for a quarterfinal berth.
The winner of that matchup will face 22-time Grand Slam champion Rafael Nadal or 24-year-old American Frances Tiafoe, who are scheduled to play in Arthur Ashe Stadium later Monday.
After a string of upsets, and Serena Williams' loss in what is expected to be her final match, left no past U.S. Open women's champions in the field, all eyes are now on No. 1 Iga Swiatek. The two-time French Open champion will try to make the U.S. Open quarterfinals for the first time when she plays unseeded Jule Niemeier.
The Ashe program begins at noon with two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova taking on the highest-ranked American woman, Jessica Pegula.

SALT LAKE CITY — The Utah Department of Health on Thursday reported 1,694 new COVID-19 cases and seven additional deaths over the past seven days.
That marks a rise to an average of 242 new cases confirmed each day. Three weeks ago, the state saw an average of 100 cases per day.
Grand County, Park City and the northern Utah County/southern Salt Lake County region are seeing high rates of the disease, while most of the state remains at low transmission levels.
More wastewater testing sites are also seeing higher rates of the virus, with an increase from 25% of sites the previous Thursday, April 21, to 59.4%.
The percentage of people visiting the emergency room with COVID-19 increased from 0.68% at last report to 0.89% of patients as of Thursday, officials noted.
On Thursday, 64 patients were hospitalized with the coronavirus across Utah.
The health department confirmed an additional 59 people in hospitals tested positive for the disease over the past seven days, which is consistent with the previous week, when 51 new patients had coronavirus.
Health care workers across the state administered 2,360 vaccine doses. Now 66.9% of residents ages 5 and older are considered fully vaccinated, and 34.7% of residents ages 12 and older have received a booster shot.
The health department has not yet attributed the current rise to a specific variant, but most of the cases earlier in April were identified as the omicron variant.
Only one K-12 school in Utah now has more than five cases of the disease — Brighton High School in the Canyons District has eight confirmed cases. Since the pandemic began, the state has confirmed 131 cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome, a complication caused by the virus, in children. The highest number of cases (48) has affected those ages 5-9, followed by those ages 0-4, with 39 cases.
To date, Utah has confirmed 932,253 COVID-19 cases and 4,747 deaths due to the disease.",2022-04-28T00:00:00Z,2022,2,25

WASHINGTON — The explosive increase in U.S. coronavirus case counts is raising alarm, but some experts believe the focus should instead be on COVID-19 hospital admissions. And those aren't climbing as fast.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, for one, said Sunday on ABC that with many infections causing few or no symptoms, ""it is much more relevant to focus on the hospitalizations as opposed to the total number of cases."" Other experts argue that case counts still have value.
As the super-contagious omicron variant rages across the U.S., new COVID-19 cases per day have more than tripled over the past two weeks, reaching a record-shattering average of 480,000. Schools, hospitals and airlines are struggling as infected workers go into isolation.
Meanwhile, hospital admissions averaged 14,800 per day last week, up 63% from the week before, but still short of the peak of 16,500 per day a year ago, when the vast majority of the U.S. was unvaccinated. Deaths have been stable over the past two weeks at an average of about 1,200 per day, well below the all-time high of 3,400 last January.
Public health experts suspect that those numbers, taken together, reflect the vaccine's continued effectiveness at preventing serious illness, even against omicron, as well as the possibility that the variant does not make most people as sick as earlier versions.
Omicron accounted for 95% of new coronavirus infections in the U.S. last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Tuesday, in another indication of how astonishingly fast the variant has spread since it was first detected in South Africa in late November.
Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, director of ICAP, a global health center at Columbia University, said the case count does not appear to be the most important number now.
Instead, she said, the U.S. at this stage of the pandemic should be ""shifting our focus, especially in an era of vaccination, to really focus on preventing illness, disability and death, and therefore counting those.""

Daily case counts and their ups and downs have been one of the most closely watched barometers during the outbreak and have been a reliable early warning sign of severe disease and death in previous coronavirus waves.
But they have long been considered an imperfect measure, in part because they consist primarily of laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19, not the actual number of infections out there, which is almost certainly many times higher.
The daily case counts are also subject to wild swings. The number of new cases recorded on Monday topped an unprecedented 1 million, a figure that may reflect cases that had been held up by reporting delays over the holiday weekend. The seven-day rolling average is considered more reliable.
Now, the value of the daily case count is being called into question as never before.
For one thing, the skyrocketing increase reflects, at least in part, an omicron-induced stampede among many Americans to get tested before holiday gatherings, and new testing requirements at workplaces and at restaurants, theaters and other sites.
Also, the true number of infections is probably much higher than the case count because the results of the at-home tests that Americans are rushing to use are not added to the official tally, and because long waits have discouraged some people from lining up to get swabbed.
But also, case numbers seem to yield a less useful picture of the pandemic amid the spread of omicron, which is causing lots of infections but so far does not appear to be as severe in its effects.
Case counts have lost relevance, said Andrew Noymer, a public health professor at the University of California, Irvine.
""Hospitalizations are where the rubber meets the road,"" Noymer said. ""It's a more objective measure."" He added: ""If I had to choose one metric, I would choose the hospitalization data.""
Even hospital numbers aren't a perfect reflection of disease severity because they include patients admitted for other health problems who happen to test positive for the coronavirus.
We should not abandon looking at case numbers, but it is important to acknowledge we're seeing only a portion of the actual number of cases.
–Dr. Eric Topol, Scripps Research Translational Institute
Keeping track of COVID-19 admissions can tell doctors something about the seriousness of the virus and also the capacity of hospitals to deal with the crisis. That, in turn, can help health leaders determine where to shift equipment and other resources.
Still, health experts are not prepared to do away with case counts.
""We should not abandon looking at case numbers,"" said Dr. Eric Topol, head of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, ""but it is important to acknowledge we're seeing only a portion of the actual number of cases.""
Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle, said that for each new infection detected, the U.S. is missing two cases. But he said tracking the number of positive test results is still important as omicron makes its way across the land.
Case numbers can point to future hot spots and indicate whether a wave of infection has peaked, Mokdad said.
Also, case counts will continue to be important to people who are vulnerable because of age or health reasons and need a sense of the virus' spread in their communities so they can make decisions about precautions, he said. Hospitals, schools and businesses need to plan for absences.
""To give up on knowing if cases are going up or down, it's flying blind. How can we as a country not know the epidemic curve for infection?"" Mokdad said.
If testing has lost its relevance, he said, it is because the U.S. never developed a way to consistently and reliably monitor infections.
""It's not acceptable to cover failure by changing the rules,"" he said.",2022-01-05T00:00:00Z,2022,1,25

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden said Monday that he's ""feeling better every day"" as he recovers from his coronavirus infection, and the White House plans to hold a summit on Tuesday to discuss developing a new generation of vaccines that could more effectively guard against contagious variants.
After participating in a virtual meeting to talk about computer chip manufacturing, Biden said ""everything's on the button"" with the medical tests he's been receiving each evening.
He also said he's been sleeping better, joking that his dog had to wake him up Monday morning.
""My wife's not here, she usually takes him out,"" Biden said. Shortly before 7 a.m., he said he felt ""the nuzzle of my dog's nose against my chest."" First lady Jill Biden has been at the family home in Delaware while the president isolates in the White House residence.
Biden said his voice is still raspy and he still has nasal congestion, but he's ""on my way to fully recovered, God willing.""
""I'm not keeping the same hours, but I'm meeting all my requirements that have come before me,"" he said.
It was Biden's first public appearance since Friday. Although his voice was deeper and raspier than normal, a deep and persistent cough was all but gone.
He is also expected to deliver pre-recorded remarks to the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives conference in Orlando, Fla.
The vaccine summit on Tuesday, which involves top administration officials, scientists and pharmaceutical executives, comes as the country faces a surge of infections from BA.5, a variant that's an offshoot of the omicron strain.
Although the current generation of vaccines, plus antiviral drugs, have helped prevent hospitalizations and deaths, there are hopes that new versions could provide more durable protection against disruptive infections.
The president was likely infected by the BA.5 variant, and he tested positive on Thursday. A new note from his doctor, released on Monday, said his symptoms have ""almost completely resolved.""
Dr. Kevin O'Connor also wrote that his vital signs remain ""absolutely normal.""
Biden has been taking the antiviral drug Paxlovid, and he plans to remain isolated in the White House residence.
""He continues to be very specifically conscientious to protect any of the Executive Residence, White House, Secret Service and other staff whose duties require any (albeit socially distanced) proximity to him,"" O'Connor wrote.",2022-07-26T00:00:00Z,2022,3,25

SALT LAKE CITY — Utah's risk factors for determining who qualifies for limited monoclonal antibody treatments for COVID-19 are being reevaluated, the state health department announced Tuesday, a day after Fox News host Tucker Carlson railed against Utah and other states for giving greater weight to nonwhites.
""Nobody automatically qualifies for treatment based on their race/ethnicity,"" Utah Department of Health spokesman Tom Hudachko said in a statement about the state's ""COVID-19 treatment risk score calculator,"" created in 2020 to help determine who is at most risk for severe disease, hospitalization and death from the virus.
But Hudachko told the Deseret News he had ""no idea what Tucker Carlson said"" about Utah, so the decision to take another look at the risk factors is ""not related to anything he said.""
The calculator assigns points to various factors, including 0.05 for every decade of age; one each for being male and/or having various specific comorbidities including hypertension, congestive heart failure and chronic liver or kidney disease.
The most points awarded, two each, are for being obese, diabetic or severely immunocompromised; or for being ""nonwhite race or Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity."" Unvaccinated Utahns now need at least 7.5 points to qualify for the treatment, or at least 10 if they are fully vaccinated, according to the document.
The scores needed were raised last week because omicron has limited the availability of the intravenous treatment, since two of the three types available are not effective against the extremely fast-spreading COVID-19 variant that has sent Utah's case counts soaring to more than double previous record levels.
Utahns were warned Thursday by health care providers there were only enough treatments for 1 in 100 who would qualify due to the state's ""really dire position when it comes to COVID-19."" Tuesday, the state health department reported 9,813 new cases and 15 additional deaths from the virus, including three that occurred prior to Dec. 11.
Hudachko said scarcity was the reason the factors were reevaluated last week and are being looked at again.
""Use of the COVID-19 treatment risk score calculator has evolved throughout the pandemic, but has always relied on current clinical data of COVID-19 patients. Given the extreme scarcity of COVID-19 treatments due to the prevalence of the omicron variant, we are reevaluating the calculator and comparing it to current data,"" he said.

Gov. Spencer Cox's office said it has received around 50 calls about Carlson's claims on Fox News that COVID-19 vaccines and treatments are being denied based on race, pointing to Utah, New York, Minnesota and other states. The Fox News host cited Utah's scoring system.
Utah has ""triaged"" COVID-19 patients using a scoring system that Carlson said ""gives two points to anyone simply for not being white. You win if you're not white. If you have congestive heart failure at the same time, you get one point. So if you're a white, congestive heart failure patient, that's not enough for you.""
Carlson went on to say that what Utah and other states are doing ""is not health care, it's punishment, it's punishment meted out on the basis of skin color,"" which he claimed is being justified because ""the United States has mistreated racial minorities in centuries past, they say. Therefore, whites must suffer now.""
The risk factors, Hudachko said, came from a subcommittee of the Utah Crisis Standards of Care Workgroup and are based on data and research provided by Intermountain Healthcare. The standards put in place by the workgroup are intended to lay out how health care should be rationed as demand exceeds what's available.
The health care system's research evaluated more than 100,000 Utahns who tested positive for COVID-19, considering variables including age, gender, symptoms, chronic medical conditions and geography, and found that nonwhites or Hispanic/Latinx people are 35-50% more likely to be hospitalized, Hudachko said.
While race does not automatically qualify someone to receive the monoclonal antibody treatment, other factors do, such as living in a long-term care facility, being unvaccinated and pregnant, or having a severe immunocompromised condition, he said.",2022-01-11T00:00:00Z,2022,1,25

WASHINGTON — Utah Sen. Mitt Romney tested positive for COVID-19 on Friday, his office said.
His wife, Ann, tested negative for the virus.
""Sen. Romney tested positive today for COVID-19. He is currently asymptomatic and will be isolating and working remotely for the recommended period of time. Mrs. Romney has tested negative. Both Senator and Mrs. Romney have been fully vaccinated and boosted against the virus,"" according to a statement from Romney's office.
The senator's office provided no details on how, when or where Romney came to test positive or why he got tested.
In May 2020, doctors directed Romney and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, to self-quarantine after being around Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who tested positive for COVID-19. Romney, who said he did not experience any symptoms, tested negative for the virus at that time.
Lee contracted COVID-19 in October 2020. He said then that he was tested after having symptoms consistent with longtime allergies.
Romney recently criticized the Biden administration for failing to ramp up testing availability ahead of the surging omicron variant.
""I think, unfortunately, the administration was wrong in not building testing capacity at a time when we all thought COVID was going away,"" he said in a Senate hearing this month.
In the same hearing, Romney said it would be helpful for people to know when they should get tested for the coronavirus, noting the lack of available test kits.
""Because I think a lot of individuals, myself included, get tested when there's no indication that I need to get tested, other than to just want to make sure I'm not sick. There's huge demand for tests which are in short supply, in part because of that,"" he said.",2022-01-28T00:00:00Z,2022,1,25

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court has stopped a major push by the Biden administration to boost the nation's COVID-19 vaccination rate, a requirement that employees at large businesses get a vaccine or test regularly and wear a mask on the job.
At the same time, the court is allowing the administration to proceed with a vaccine mandate for most health care workers in the U.S. The court's orders Thursday came during a spike in coronavirus cases caused by the omicron variant.
The court's conservative majority concluded the administration overstepped its authority by seeking to impose the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's vaccine-or-test rule on U.S. businesses with at least 100 employees. More than 80 million people would have been affected and OSHA had estimated that the rule would save 6,500 lives and prevent 250,000 hospitalizations over six months.
""OSHA has never before imposed such a mandate. Nor has Congress. Indeed, although Congress has enacted significant legislation addressing the COVID–19 pandemic, it has declined to enact any measure similar to what OSHA has promulgated here,"" the conservatives wrote in an unsigned opinion.
In dissent, the court's three liberals argued that it was the court that was overreaching by substituting its judgment for that of health experts. ""Acting outside of its competence and without legal basis, the Court displaces the judgments of the government officials given the responsibility to respond to workplace health emergencies,"" Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a joint dissent.
President Joe Biden said he was ""disappointed that the Supreme Court has chosen to block common-sense life-saving requirements for employees at large businesses that were grounded squarely in both science and the law.""
Biden called on businesses to institute their own vaccination requirements, noting that a third of Fortune 100 companies already have done so.
When crafting the OSHA rule, White House officials always anticipated legal challenges — and privately some harbored doubts that it could withstand them. The administration nonetheless still views the rule as a success at already driving millions of people to get vaccinated and encouraging private businesses to implement their own requirements that are unaffected by the legal challenge.
The OSHA regulation had initially been blocked by a federal appeals court in New Orleans, then allowed to take effect by a federal appellate panel in Cincinnati.
Both rules had been challenged by Republican-led states, including Utah. In addition, business groups attacked the OSHA emergency regulation as too expensive and likely to cause workers to leave their jobs at a time when finding new employees already is difficult.
The National Retail Federation, the nation's largest retail trade group, called the Supreme Court's decision ""a significant victory for employers.""
Mandate upheld for health care workers
The vaccine mandate that the court will allow to be enforced nationwide scraped by on a 5-4 vote, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joining the liberals to form a majority. The mandate covers virtually all health care workers in the country, applying to providers that receive federal Medicare or Medicaid funding. It affects 10.4 million workers at 76,000 health care facilities as well as home health care providers. The rule has medical and religious exemptions.
Biden said that decision by the court ""will save lives.""
In an unsigned opinion, the court wrote: ""The challenges posed by a global pandemic do not allow a federal agency to exercise power that Congress has not conferred upon it. At the same time, such unprecedented circumstances provide no grounds for limiting the exercise of authorities the agency has long been recognized to have."" It said the ""latter principle governs"" in the health care arena.
Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in dissent that the case was about whether the administration has the authority ""to force health care workers, by coercing their employers, to undergo a medical procedure they do not want and cannot undo."" He said the administration hadn't shown convincingly that Congress gave it that authority.
Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett signed onto Thomas' opinion. Alito wrote a separate dissent that the other three conservatives also joined.
Decisions by federal appeals courts in New Orleans and St. Louis had blocked the mandate in about half the states. The administration already was taking steps to enforce it elsewhere.
More than 208 million Americans, 62.7% of the population, are fully vaccinated, and more than a third of those have received booster shots, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All nine justices have gotten booster shots.
The courthouse remains closed to the public, and lawyers and reporters are asked for negative test results before being allowed inside the courtroom for arguments, though vaccinations are not required.
The justices heard arguments on the challenges last week. Their questions then hinted at the split verdict that they issued Thursday.
A separate vaccine mandate for federal contractors, on hold after lower courts blocked it, has not been considered by the Supreme Court.

MILLCREEK — On a windy afternoon at Rancho Market in Millcreek, shoppers and passersby stopped to pick up something other than the usual family groceries: a free vaccine or booster in the fight against COVID-19.
Nallily Huerta was one of those worried about the virus. So she got in line for her first booster shot at a mobile clinic set up by the Salt Lake County Health Department. Huerta has already received the first two doses of the vaccine and opted to get another shot for added protection from the virus.
""The first booster is particularly important because the primary series gets your body used to understanding what it's fighting,"" according to Dr. Tamara Sheffield, Intermountain Health Care's Medical director of Community Health and Prevention.
""It's a different kind of cell response, that actually enhances the ability to fight and fight quickly,"" Sheffield added.
But with COVID-19 rates rising in Utah and throughout most of the country, public health officials are most concerned about people over 50 and the immunocompromised.
It's recommended these Utahns get a second booster four months after the first.
Dr. Sheffield points to the fact that ""a second booster will have a higher level of protection against severe disease – the things that put you in the hospital,"" she said. ""There's a real difference for individuals who've had that second booster.""
While infection rates around the country are climbing, officials believe hospital rates remain low largely due to the vaccines and boosters. People are getting sick, but not as severe as just a few months ago.
The pandemic is a journey and that journey is not done yet.
–Dr. Tamara Sheffield, Intermountain Health Care
But Dr. Sheffield warns that we are hardly done with the pandemic.
""The pandemic is a journey and that journey is not done yet,"" she said.
The coming months will see life continue to return to something like normal, with larger public gatherings. With it comes the fear from pandemic watchers of new subvariants that become more difficult to predict.
And for Utahns traveling outside the state there is this, Sheffield said, it's important to keep in mind that fellow sightseers will be coming from all sorts of locations.
""People really do need to consider, now is the time to do your booster. That's a trigger to get the second booster,"" Sheffield said.

Novak Djokovic will be allowed to defend his title at Wimbledon, despite not being vaccinated against COVID-19, because the shots are not required to enter Britain, All England Club chief executive Sally Bolton said Tuesday.
Djokovic, a 34-year-old Serb who is ranked No. 1, missed the Australian Open in January after being deported from that country because he was not vaccinated against the illness caused by the coronavirus that has led to the deaths of millions during the pandemic that began in 2020.
During the annual spring briefing ahead of Wimbledon, which starts on June 27, Bolton said that ""whilst, of course, it is encouraged"" that all players get vaccinated, ""it will not be a condition of entry to compete"" at the grass-court Grand Slam tournament this year.
Djokovic, in addition to being unable to defend his championship at Melbourne Park after an 11-day legal saga over whether he could remain in Australia, had to sit out tournaments at Indian Wells and Miami because he couldn't travel to the United States as a foreigner who is unvaccinated.
The U.S. Tennis Association has said that it will follow whatever governmental rules are in place regarding COVID-19 vaccination status when the U.S. Open is held starting in late August.
Djokovic — who has said he got COVID-19 twice, once each in 2020 and 2021 — owns 20 Grand Slam singles titles, tied with Roger Federer for the second-most for a man. They trail Rafael Nadal, who won his 21st at the Australian Open.
Six of Djokovic's trophies came at Wimbledon, including victories each of the past three times the tournament was held — in 2018, 2019 and 2021. It was not held in 2020 because of the pandemic.
After what happened in Australia, Djokovic said he would be willing to sit out other Grand Slam tournaments if getting vaccinated were a requirement to compete. The next major event is the French Open, which begins on May 22, and tournament director Amelie Mauresmo said last month there was nothing preventing Djokovic from defending his 2021 title in Paris.
The Italian Open, a clay-court tune-up for Roland Garros, also has said Djokovic can play there next month.

SALT LAKE CITY — Utah health officials reported 11 COVID-19 deaths on Friday, along with 425 new cases of the disease.
The rolling seven-day average for new positive tests is now 559 per day, according to the Utah Department of Health, which continues to decrease from a high of 10,967 on Jan. 19. The rolling seven-day average for people testing positive for COVID-19 is currently 18.4%, down from a high of 46.7% almost a month ago on Jan. 27.
The health department reported another 3,539 people who were tested for the coronavirus and 5,165 who were vaccinated against it.
On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new metrics to determine if masks should be worn indoors. The metrics, which create a ""COVID-19 community level"" take into account new COVID-19 hospitalizations, hospital capacity and new COVID-19 cases.
New CDC guidelines in Utah
Under these new CDC guidelines, San Juan County and Tooele County currently have high COVID-19 community levels and the agency suggests wearing a mask indoors when in public.
Salt Lake County and many others in the state have a medium COVID-19 community level, in which the CDC currently suggests wearing masks for people who are immunocompromised, at high risk, or if have contact with someone who is high risk.
Utah, Emery, Juab, Millard, Sevier and Wayne counties each have low community levels. In these locations, the CDC does not suggest wearing a mask but says people can choose to based on personal preference and risk level.
Although these are general guidelines, the CDC said individuals can always choose to wear a mask, and that people who have symptoms, have tested positive for COVID-19 or have been exposed should wear a mask regardless of COVID-19 community level. The CDC also encourages people in all COVID-19 community levels to get vaccinated against the disease and be tested if they have symptoms.
Previous guidelines considered levels of transmission, which recommended that masks be worn in most of the country.
More Utah data
Currently, 372 people are hospitalized in Utah with COVID-19, according to the health department; 101 of the patients are in an intensive care unit. About 60% of all hospital beds are currently in use, including almost 75% of intensive care unit beds and almost 79% of ICU referral center beds.
Throughout the pandemic, Utah has seen a total of 33,126 hospitalizations due to COVID-19, almost 14,000 of which were among Salt Lake County residents and just over 5,000 were Utah county residents, health department data shows.
School children account for 55 of Friday's new cases. Of those cases, 28 were children between ages 5 and 10, nine were ages 11-13, and 18 were ages 14-17.
Utah has had a total of 4,408 COVID-19 deaths since the pandemic reached Utah in March 2020. Of the 11 deaths reported on Friday, one occurred more than a month ago.
The latest deaths include:
- A Salt Lake County man, between the ages of 45 and 64, who was not hospitalized when he died
- A Davis County man, over 85, not hospitalized
- A Box Elder County woman, over 85, long-term care facility resident

AUCKLAND, New Zealand — A 6-month-old baby who is critically ill will be placed under the temporary guardianship of New Zealand's High Court after his parents refused to allow him to undergo life-saving heart surgery using blood from people vaccinated against COVID-19.
Handing down the judgment on Wednesday, Justice Ian Gault ruled that the boy, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, would remain under the court's guardianship until he had recovered from the surgery.
The court also appointed two doctors as its agents to oversee issues around the operation and the administration of blood, according to court documents.
The baby has a congenital heart defect and needs urgent open-heart surgery to survive — but the operation has been delayed by his parents' insistence that only blood from donors not vaccinated against COVID-19 be used.
The case has drawn attention to the ramifications of vaccine misinformation two years into global inoculation drives.
The baby's parents believed there were ""spike proteins in the blood of people who have been vaccinated and that these proteins were causing unexpected deaths relating to transfusions,"" according to the judgment.
The parents had previously demanded the New Zealand Blood Service take a donation from a person chosen by the family, but the agency refused and said it does not make a distinction between vaccinated and unvaccinated donors.
The court heard that Dr. Kirsten Finucane, chief pediatric cardiac surgeon at Auckland's Starship Hospital, told the parents it was ""simply impractical to have a directed donor.""
Finucane had consulted with other experts and found that a cardiac bypass without using blood or blood products would not be an option for the baby's surgery, the court heard.
With the parents and doctors unable to agree on the infant's treatment and blood transfusion, the New Zealand Health Service made an application under the Care of Children Act in November, requesting the court to appoint a doctor to take temporary guardianship of the baby for his medical care only.
Following the court's ruling, Dr. Mike Shepherd, Auckland's interim director of the New Zealand Health Service, said its decisions were ""always made with the best interests of the child in mind.""
""We acknowledge the decision made by the court, following our application in relation to the baby's surgery and recognize this is a difficult situation for all involved,"" Shepherd said in a statement.
CNN has reached out to the lawyer representing the baby's parents but has not received a response.

WASHINGTON — A third dose of Pfizer and BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine produced significant protection against the omicron variant in healthy children aged between 5 and 11 years in a trial, the companies said on Thursday.
Blood serum analysis of a few pediatric participants who received a booster dose in the study showed a 36-fold increase in omicron-neutralizing antibodies, the drugmakers said.
Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 wild-type strain rose six-fold following the booster shot.
The mid-to-late stage study was testing the safety and immunogenicity of a 10-microgram booster dose in 140 healthy children aged 5 through 11 years.
Pfizer and its German partner said the data reinforces the potential function of a third dose of the vaccine in maintaining high levels of protection against the virus in this age group.
The companies plan to apply for Emergency Use Authorization of a booster dose in the 5-11 age group in the coming days, with additional submissions to global regulatory agencies including the European Medicines Agency to follow.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration authorized a third dose of the vaccine for children ages 12 to 15 and those aged 5 through 11 years who are immunocompromised.
The agency at the time said it will weigh boosters for 5 to 11-year-olds after more children receive two doses.
According to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, about 8 million children aged between 5 and 11 in the United States are fully vaccinated.",2022-04-14T00:00:00Z,2022,2,25

SALT LAKE CITY — Utah health officials were in the process of moving into endemic stages when omicron happened.
""It's really a pandemic within a pandemic,"" Michelle Hoffman, deputy director and chief medical adviser at the Utah Department of Health, told members of the Social Services Appropriations Subcommittee on Wednesday. ""We're seeing record-high cases and positivity — it's highly likely that anyone with symptoms has COVID-19 and that most of the population is going to be exposed.""
The latest and more transmissible omicron variant of COVID-19 has kept the health department on its toes, forcing officials to rethink strategies, including limiting testing for the virus, as the state last week told people to assume they're COVID-positive when symptoms exist.
On Wednesday, Utah's lawmakers were told something many of them have been dying to hear — omicron can't really be stopped by people wearing masks, though it can be slowed.
""We are expecting omicron to spread throughout our population in Utah regardless of the measures that we take,"" Hoffman said. ""It is incredibly transmissible. Masks do help to mitigate the spread, whether it will stop the spread, that's just not possible.""
Hoffman said the only way out of it, including helping the ongoing strain on hospitals and protecting essential workers in various industries, is getting booster vaccine doses to Utah's population who have been vaccinated.
""Booster doses remain the best path forward out of the pandemic,"" she said, adding that just 42.6% of Utahns 18 and older have received a booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.
""With waning immunity from the primary vaccine series, for which most Utahns completed almost 10 months ago, booster doses are really critical in the fight against omicron,"" Hoffman said. ""It remains our top priority to get boosters to all Utahns.""
The health department, she told lawmakers, is ""pivoting away"" from contact-tracing every case to working mainly to identify high-risk interventions and preventing the most severe outcomes. The mortality rate, she said, remains low, but is significantly higher among the immunocompromised, elderly and unvaccinated Utahns.
Fewer people in Utah are dying with omicron, as well as needing intensive care at hospitals, which is a relief, Hoffman said, but because of the sheer number of people impacted by it, systems are still overwhelmed.
Committee Chairman Rep. Jacob Anderegg, R-Lehi, said he's had COVID-19 ""three times,"" and joked that media reports of the pandemic were not accurate. He said numbers providing ""the odds"" of getting sick or dying aren't helpful, as he wants proof that vaccination is helping to save lives.
Committee members interrupted Hoffman several times to ask her whether people are dying ""with COVID or from COVID"" after being checked into the hospital for other reasons, which the state health department has previously addressed. Hoffman said the department conducts ""rigorous evaluations"" to conclude that reported deaths are ""due to COVID-19.""
Since booster doses became available, the health department reports there have been 1,574 deaths among people who were unvaccinated and 405 people who experienced breakthrough cases, having been fully vaccinated when it was confirmed they had COVID-19.
Hoffman said officials believe the current omicron surge will be ""short-lived"" but should be dealt with differently than previous variants of COVID-19, as omicron ""is acting very differently.""
""It's really time to plan ... to support essential services ongoing,"" she said.
Members of the Utah House on Wednesday delayed voting on a resolution to overturn existing mask mandates in Salt Lake and Summit counties. The Senate passed the measure on Tuesday.",2022-01-19T00:00:00Z,2022,1,25

WASHINGTON — The U.S. government is planning to roll out COVID-19 shots for children under the age of 5 as soon as Feb. 21, according to a document from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is considering authorizing the use of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine in the age group even though it did not meet a key target in a clinical trial of 2- to 4-year-olds.
The drugmakers said they submitted data supporting authorization at the request of the FDA in order to address an urgent public health need in the age group.
Outside advisers to the FDA are scheduled to meet on Feb. 15 to discuss whether to recommend the regulator to authorize the vaccine. The rollout of the vaccine for children under the age of 5, the only age group not yet eligible for the shots, is set to begin less than a week after the meeting.
According to the CDC document, the U.S. government is planning to ship an initial 10 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to states and other entities before the end of February, should the FDA authorize their use.
There are about 18 million children aged between 6 months to 4 years in the United States, and there will be additional supply beyond the first 10 million doses, the CDC said.
The first rollout, which begins on Feb. 21, will prioritize areas where children are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 disease.
Jurisdictions and federal pharmacy partners will receive second and third shipments of doses on Feb. 23 and Feb. 25, or about a week after the CDC recommendation.
Young children will receive a lower dose of the vaccine, if it is authorized. Pfizer-BioNTech tested a 3-microgram dose of the vaccine in the age group, compared with a 10-microgram dose in 5- to 11-year-olds and 30 micrograms for people aged 12 and older.",2022-02-09T00:00:00Z,2022,1,25

WASHINGTON — Kids ages 5 to 11 should get a booster dose of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine, advisers to the U.S. government said Thursday.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention quickly adopted the panel's recommendation, opening a third COVID-19 shot to healthy elementary-age kids — just like what is already recommended for everybody 12 and older.
The hope is that an extra shot will shore up protection for kids ages 5 to 11 as infections once again are on the rise.
""Vaccination with a primary series among this age group has lagged behind other age groups leaving them vulnerable to serious illness,"" said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, in a statement.
""We know that these vaccines are safe, and we must continue to increase the number of children who are protected,"" she said.
Earlier this week, the Food and Drug Administration authorized Pfizer's kid-sized booster, to be offered at least five months after the youngsters' last shot.
The CDC takes the next step of recommending who actually needs vaccinations. Its advisers debated if all otherwise healthy 5- to 11-year-olds need an extra dose, especially since so many children were infected during the huge winter surge of the omicron variant.
But the U.S. now is averaging 100,000 new cases a day for the first time since February. And ultimately, the CDC's advisers pointed to growing evidence from older kids and adults that two primary vaccinations plus a booster are providing the best protection against the newest coronavirus variants.
""This always perhaps should have been a three-dose vaccine,"" said Dr. Grace Lee of Stanford University, who chairs the CDC's advisory panel.
The booster question isn't the hottest vaccine topic: Parents still are anxiously awaiting a chance to vaccinate kids under 5 — the only group not yet eligible in the U.S.
Dr. Doran Fink of the Food and Drug Administration said the agency is working ""as rapidly as we can"" to evaluate an application from vaccine maker Moderna, and is awaiting final data on the littlest kids from rival Pfizer. The FDA's own advisers are expected to publicly debate data from one or both companies next month.
For the 5- to 11-year-olds, it's not clear how much booster demand there will be. Only about 30% of that age group have had the initial two Pfizer doses since vaccinations opened to them in November.
CDC adviser Dr. Helen Keipp Talbot of Vanderbilt University said health authorities must put more effort into getting youngsters their initial shots.
""That needs to be a priority,"" she said.
Thursday's decision also means that 5- to 11-year-olds with severely weakened immune systems, who are supposed to get three initial shots, would be eligible for a fourth dose.
Pfizer and its partner BioNTech currently make the only COVID-19 vaccine available for children of any age in the U.S. Those ages 5 to 11 receive a dose that's one-third the amount given to everyone 12 and older.
In a small study, Pfizer found a booster revved up those kids' levels of virus-fighting antibodies — including those able to fight the super-contagious omicron variant — the same kind of jump adults get from an extra shot.
Vaccines may not always prevent milder infections, and the omicron variant proved especially able to slip past their defenses. But CDC cited data during the omicron surge that showed unvaccinated 5- to 11-year-olds had twice the rate of hospitalization as youngsters who got their first two doses.
Health authorities say for all ages, the vaccines are still offering strong protection against COVID-19's worst outcomes, especially after a third dose.
Some especially high-risk people, including those 50 and older, have been offered the choice of a second booster, or fourth shot — and the CDC on Thursday strengthened that recommendation, too, urging anyone who's eligible to go ahead and get the extra dose.
Still to be decided is whether everyone will need additional shots in the fall, possibly reformulated to offer better protection against newer coronavirus variants.",2022-05-20T00:00:00Z,2022,2,25

WASHINGTON — The United States will end a sweeping, pandemic-related expulsion policy that has effectively closed down the U.S. asylum system at the border with Mexico, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said on Friday.
The Title 42 public health order will remain in effect until May 23, Mayorkas said in a statement.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which issued the order in March 2020 as countries around the world shuttered their borders amid COVID-19 fears, said it was no longer needed to limit the spread of the virus.
""After considering current public health conditions and an increased availability of tools to fight COVID-19 (such as highly effective vaccines and therapeutics), the CDC Director has determined that an Order suspending the right to introduce migrants into the United States is no longer necessary,"" the CDC said in a separate statement.
The formal announcement comes after Reuters and other news outlets reported details of the plan on Wednesday.
President Joe Biden kept Title 42 in place after taking office in January 2021 despite fierce criticism from his own political party and campaign promises to reverse the restrictive immigration policies of his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump.
Leading Democrats, medical experts and the United Nations have criticized Title 42, saying it expels migrants to danger in Mexico and that scientific evidence does not support its stated goal of limiting the spread of the virus.
Several migrants in a nearly 2,000-person encampment in Reynosa, Mexico, told Reuters on Thursday they were hopeful the order would be lifted so they could legally claim asylum in the United States.
Republicans blasted Biden this week following reports the order would be ended, saying lifting the pandemic restrictions would encourage more migrants to enter illegally at a time when border crossings are already breaking records.
U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials said earlier this week that they were preparing to handle a sharp spike in border crossings, but that it remained unclear whether lifting the COVID-era order would increase migration.

A look at what's happening around the majors today:
___
TIME FOR A SALE
Red Sox lefty Chris Sale is set to make his season debut when he starts against Tampa Bay at Tropicana Field.
Sale has been out with a fracture in his right rib cage. He's made four minor league rehab starts, allowing three earned runs in 11 1/3 innings and striking out 19.
The 33-year-old Sale is a seven-time All-Star and could be a big key to Boston's push for a playoff spot.
All-Star third baseman Rafael Devers also is likely to return for the Red Sox after missing three starts because of back discomfort. He's hitting .327 with 19 home runs and 51 RBIs.
Two-time Cy Young Award winner Corey Kluber (4-5, 3.62 ERA) starts for the Rays.
MISSIN' PHILS
The Philadelphia Phillies will be without J.T. Realmuto, Alec Bohm, Aaron Nola and Kyle Gibson during a two-game series in Toronto due to Canadian restrictions on unvaccinated travelers.
Nola started on the mound Monday night at St. Louis and was not scheduled to pitch against the Blue Jays. Bohm, an infielder, came out of Monday's game with an apparent hand injury.
President of Baseball Operations Dave Dombrowski told reporters before the game that the four players will be placed on the restricted list and forfeit two days of pay and major league service time in accordance with the terms of MLB's collective bargaining agreement.
Several teams have put players on the restricted list this year before trips to Toronto.
3-PETE?
New York Mets slugger Pete Alonso will try to become the first player to win the All-Star Home Run Derby three straight times, and his competition is likely to be announced in the coming days.
Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. and Cardinals great Albert Pujols also confirmed Monday they'll be among the eight participants in the July 18 competition at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.
""It's a really fun event, and it's going to be super exciting,"" Alonso said before the Mets beat Atlanta on Monday night. ""I have a really good plan to go into it and, again, I have just so much fun. I don't think anyone has more fun than I do, especially when it comes to this event.""
Alonso hit 74 total home runs in last year's Derby at Denver's Coors Field and beat Baltimore's Trey Mancini 23-22 in the final round. Alonso joined Ken Griffey Jr. (1998-99) and Yoenis Céspedes (2013-14) in winning consecutive titles. Griffey also won in 1994 and is the only three-time champion.
There was no Derby in 2020, when the All-Star Game scheduled for Dodger Stadium was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic. Alonso won the 2019 Derby at Cleveland as a rookie when he defeated Vladimir Guerrero Jr.
ARCH ENEMIES
After winning the final seven games of a 10-1 homestand, Trea Turner, Mookie Betts and the Los Angeles Dodgers look to extend their winning streak when they hit the road. They visit Albert Pujols and the St. Louis Cardinals in the opener of a star-studded series between two of the National League's most successful franchises.
Mitch White (1-1, 3.38 ERA) pitches for the NL West leaders against rookie left-hander Matthew Liberatore (2-1, 4.74).
ON THE RISE
A couple of under-the-radar American League teams are quietly riding eight-game winning streaks.
Jordan Lyles (5-7, 4.50 ERA) and the Baltimore Orioles (43-44), last in the loaded AL East, can reach .500 for the first time since opening 4-4 last year with a road win at Wrigley Field over the Chicago Cubs, who have dropped four straight.
The Orioles had not won eight consecutive games in a season since 2005, though they won 12 straight across two seasons in late 2015 and early 2016.
""We're just having a really good time in here,"" designated hitter Trey Mancini said.
All-Star rookie Julio Rodríguez and the Mariners go for their ninth victory in a row when they begin a two-game series at last-place Washington with Chris Flexen (5-8, 4.00 ERA) trying to win his fourth consecutive start.
Seattle is 16-3 for its best 19-game stretch since 2003. Right back in the wild-card race, the Mariners (45-42) are looking to make the playoffs for the first time since 2001.
""You can't celebrate anything. We're not there,"" manager Scott Servais said. ""But everybody knows the drought. It rains a lot in Seattle, so we've got to end the drought.""
AILING RAYS
Already depleted by injuries, the Tampa Bay Rays will now be missing shortstop Wander Franco and center fielder Kevin Kiermaier for a while.
Franco is set for surgery on his right wrist and expected to be sidelined for five to eight weeks. The 21-year-old Franco is hitting .260 with five homers and 23 RBIs in 58 games in the first season of a $182 million, 11-year contract.
Franco missed a month earlier this season because of a quadriceps injury.
The 32-year-old Kiermaier is dealing with left hip inflammation. He will see a hip specialist in Tennessee after the All-Star break.
""KK's going to be down for some time,"" manager Kevin Cash said. ""We need to let the hip calm down and let the expert give his recommendation. KK might have a decision to make at that point.""
Kiermaier is batting .228 with seven homers and 22 RBIs in 63 games this season.

Traditionally, U.S. healthcare has been reactionary and focused more on treating disease in people who are already sick. More recently, there has been significant movement toward a more proactive approach that aims to prevent disease in the first place.
Scheduling an annual visit with your doctor is one of the best preventative measures you can take for your future health and wellbeing.
While you are likely familiar with the concept of a yearly physical, there is another type of visit that is equally as important if you are of Medicare-age called an annual wellness visit (AWV).
Let's break down the difference between the two and why they are important:
Annual wellness visits
For patients of Medicare-age (65+), these are yearly appointments with your primary care provider that provide an opportunity to create and discuss your personalized health plan. These visits are not the same as yearly physicals because they are more hands-off.
During an annual wellness visit, your doctor will typically:
- Take routine measurements, such as blood pressure and heart rate
- Discuss your immediate long-term health goals
- Review your current medication list and recommend adjustments as necessary
- Assess your functional abilities, (i.e., cognitive and hearing) and perform a fall-risk assessment
- Screening for cognitive impairment, including dementia
- Provide personalized health education
An AWV is an opportunity to proactively identify risk factors for certain chronic disease, such as diabetes and heart disease, and work with your provider to mitigate or prevent disease altogether.
Be sure to let your doctor's office know if you would like an AWV specifically. AWVs are generally covered 100% by Medicare and other insurance companies, while physical exams generally require a co-pay.
Annual physicals
Even if you are young and feel healthy, it's a good idea to get in the habit of seeing your primary care doctor at least once a year. Annual physical exams can uncover ""silent"" health conditions, such as high blood pressure, that can damage your health without causing any symptoms. It's much easier and more effective to catch potential problems early on when they are more manageable, and annual physicals are especially important for those that have a history of medical conditions in their family, such as cancer or high blood pressure.
At your annual physical, your doctor will:
- Check your vital signs: This includes taking your temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration rate.
- Perform the physical exam: This step includes inspecting your eyes, ears, and throat. Your provider may also touch areas like your abdomen and back to check for issues.
- Update your vaccines: Depending on your current age, your physician may recommend new vaccinations or booster shots.
- Make sure you get the screenings you need: Your physician will let you know if you need a blood test, colonoscopy, or bone density scan and help you schedule them.
- Update your health records: If you have existing conditions or experience any changes to your health, your physician will help you keep your current health practices and records up-to-date.

WASHINGTON — The Justice Department said Tuesday it will not appeal a federal district judge's ruling that ended the nation's federal mask mandate on public transit unless the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention believes the requirement is still necessary.
In a statement released a day after a Florida judge ended the sweeping mandate, which required face coverings on planes and trains and in transit hubs, Justice Department spokesman Anthony Coley said officials believe that the federal mask order was ""a valid exercise of the authority Congress has given CDC to protect the public health."" He said it was ""an important authority the Department will continue to work to preserve.""
Coley said the CDC had said it would continue to assess public health conditions, and if the agency determined a mandate was necessary for public health, the Justice Department would file an appeal.
As of Tuesday, the agency hadn't made a determination, officials said.
The federal judge's ruling did away with the last major vestige of federal pandemic rules and led to a mishmash of new locally created rules that reflected the nation's ongoing divisions over how to battle the virus.
Major airlines and airports in places like Dallas, Atlanta, Los Angeles and Salt Lake City quickly switched to a mask-optional policy. Los Angeles County dropped its mandate for mass transit and a train conductor in New Jersey told commuters of their masks Tuesday: ""Feel free to burn them at will.""
New York City, Chicago and Connecticut, however, continued to require masks for travelers.
The ride-sharing companies Lyft and Uber announced on their websites Tuesday that masks will now be optional while riding or driving.
Even Walt Disney World in Florida on Tuesday announced it was lifting its mask requirement for its monorail, buses and sky gondola.
For many, the news was welcome. A video showed some passengers on a Delta Air Lines flight cheering and applauding as they removed masks upon hearing the announcement they were now optional. One man happily twirled his mask on his finger.
However Brooke Tansley, a television producer and former Broadway performer, was incensed after boarding a flight with her 4-year-old and 8-month-old baby— neither old enough to be vaccinated — only to learn the mask mandate had ended mid-flight.
""Very very angry about this,"" she said in a tweet, noting her baby was too young to wear a mask.
President Joe Biden went all-in on flexibility Tuesday when asked if Americans should mask up on planes.
""That's up to them,"" Biden declared during a visit to Portsmouth, New Hampshire. But the White House continues to require face coverings for those traveling with him on Air Force One, citing CDC guidance.
In Portland, Oregon, transit employees immediately began taking down ""mask required"" announcements and signs, but said it would likely take several days to remove everything.
The city joined Atlanta, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Kansas City, Missouri, and two of Alaska's largest cities, Anchorage and Juneau, in making masking optional on mass transit.
Some passengers at Chicago's Union Station said the rules were confusing. Amtrak dropped its requirement. The Chicago Transit Authority and Metra, the regional commuter rail service, kept the requirement at first but dropped it late Tuesday.
""It's like this patchwork of different rules and enforcement of it,"" said Erik Abderhalden, who wore a mask as he waited for a Metra train to his home in suburban Naperville. ""I mean, it's like Swiss cheese ... there's no uniformity and it seems pretty laissez-faire.""
Subway rider Cooper Klinges was pleased that New York City's public transit system wasn't following the trend and planned to keep its mask requirement in place. As he waited at a Brooklyn train station, he said he canceled a flight earlier this year over concerns about the virus.
""I don't think we are out of the woods yet,"" said Klinges, a teacher, citing concerns about the BA.2 omicron subvariant of the coronavirus. ""It is still around. We have to still stick it out.""
The CDC had recently extended the mask mandate, which was set to expire Monday, until May 3 to allow more time to study the subvariant, which is now responsible for the vast majority of U.S. cases. But the court ruling puts that decision on hold.
After a winter surge fueled by the omicron variant that prompted record hospitalizations, the U.S. has seen a significant drop in virus spread in recent months that led most states and cities to drop mask mandates.
But several Northeast cities have seen a rise in hospitalizations in recent weeks, leading Philadelphia to bring back its mask mandate.

SALT LAKE CITY — Utah health officials reported 11 additional COVID-19 deaths on Friday, along with 261 new cases.
The rolling seven-day average for new positive tests is now 337 per day, which is 30 less than Thursday's report and still on a downward trend, the Utah Department of Health reports. The seven-day average for positive tests is currently 11.9%.
Utah's statewide epidemic curve is continuing the decline that began on Jan. 21. Each of the Utah counties also have a declining epidemic curve, according to the health department.
Another 3,258 people were tested for active coronavirus and another 2,477 were vaccinated since Thursday's report. In all, there have been close to 5 million vaccines administered throughout Utah since doses became available in December 2020. The health department reports that 1,986,555 people in Utah are considered fully vaccinated and 874,243 have received booster doses of the COVID-19 vaccines.
On Friday, there were 287 people with COVID-19 hospitalized throughout the state, with 66 of those patients in intensive care units, according to the health department.
School children account for 35 of Friday's reported cases. Of those cases, 17 were children between ages 5 and 10, 7 were ages 11-13, and 11 were age 14-17. No schools in the state have more than eight active COVID-19 cases, state data show, and only 10 Utah schools have five or more cases.
Over the last 28 days, Utahns who are not vaccinated have had a 1.9 times greater risk of testing positive, a 2.4 times greater risk of hospitalization, and a 5.1 times greater risk of dying from COVID-19, according to health officials. Compared to Utahns who have received vaccinations and a booster shot, anyone who is not vaccinated has an estimated 2.1 times greater risk of testing positive, a six times greater risk of hospitalization, and a 16.3 times greater risk of dying from COVID-19.
Utah health officials have reported a total of 924,248 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state since the pandemic began. Of those 905,491 are estimated to be recovered, 13,304 are estimated to be ongoing and 4,453, or about 0.48%, resulted in death.
Throughout the pandemic, Utah has maintained one of the lowest COVID-19 mortality rates in the nation, according to U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention.
Of the 11 COVID-19 deaths reported on Friday, one occurred over a month ago, the health department said.
The latest deaths include:
- A Cache County woman, 65-84, who was not hospitalized when she died.
- A Davis County man, 65-84, hospitalized.
- A Davis County woman, 65-84, hospitalized.
- A Salt Lake County woman, 45-64, hospitalized.
- A Salt Lake County woman, 65-84, not hospitalized.
- A Salt Lake County woman, 65-84, long-term care facility resident.
- A Salt Lake County man, 65-84, hospitalized.
- A Uintah County man, over 85, not hospitalized.
- A Utah County man, 45-64, long-term care facility resident.
- A Washington County man, over 85, hospitalized.
- A Weber County man, over 85, not hospitalized.",2022-03-04T00:00:00Z,2022,1,25

LONDON — Boris Johnson said on Thursday he was resigning as Britain's prime minister, bowing to calls from ministerial colleagues and lawmakers in his Conservative Party.
Below is a summary of some of those who could be in the frame to replace him. There is no clear favorite and they are not listed in order of likely prospects.
Liz Truss
Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, has been the darling of the ruling Conservative Party's grassroots and has regularly topped polls of party members carried out by the website Conservative Home.
Truss has a carefully cultivated public image and was photographed in a tank last year, echoing a famous 1986 photo of Britain's first female prime minister, Margaret Thatcher.
The 46-year-old initially campaigned against Brexit but, after the referendum, said she had changed her mind.
She spent the first two years of Johnson's premiership as international trade secretary and was last year appointed as Britain's lead negotiator with the European Union.
Truss is now in charge of dealing with the EU over post-Brexit trade rules for Northern Ireland, where she has taken an increasingly tough line in negotiations.
She said on Monday that Johnson had her ""100% backing"" and she urged colleagues to support him.
Jeremy Hunt
Jeremy Hunt is the former foreign secretary, 55, finished second to Johnson in the 2019 leadership contest. He would offer a more serious and less controversial style of leadership after the turmoil of Johnson's premiership.
Over the last two years, Hunt has used his experience as a former health secretary to chair parliament's health select committee and has not been tarnished by having served in the current government.
Earlier this year, he said his ambition to become prime minister ""hasn't completely vanished."" Hunt said he voted to oust Johnson in a confidence vote last month that the prime minister narrowly won.
Hunt supported remaining in the EU ahead of the 2016 vote. It is unclear whether he would feel the need to maintain a tough line against Brussels, to win the support of Conservative voters, or whether he could pursue a more pragmatic relationship to improve post-Brexit trade.
Ben Wallace
Defense minister Ben Wallace, 52, has risen in recent months to overtake Truss as the most popular member of the government with Conservative Party members, according to Conservative Home, thanks to his handling of the Ukraine crisis.
A former soldier, he was mentioned in dispatches in 1992 for an incident in which the patrol he was commanding captured an Irish Republican Army guerrilla unit suspected of trying to carry out a bomb attack on British troops.
He began his political career as a member of Scotland's devolved assembly in May 1999, before being first elected to the Westminster parliament in 2005.
He was security minister from 2016 until taking on his current role three years later, winning plaudits as his department evacuated British nationals and allies from Afghanistan last year, and for sending weapons to Kyiv.
He supported remaining in the EU ahead of the referendum.
Rishi Sunak
Rishi Sunak, who resigned as finance minister on Tuesday saying the British public ""rightly expect government to be conducted properly, competently and seriously"", was until last year the favorite to succeed Johnson.
He was praised for a COVID-19 economic rescue package, including a costly jobs retention program that averted mass unemployment.
But Sunak later faced criticism for not giving enough cost-of-living support to households. Revelations about his wealthy wife's non-domiciled tax status and a fine he received, along with Johnson, for breaking COVID lockdown rules have damaged his standing.
His tax-and-spend budget last year put Britain on course for its biggest tax burden since the 1950s, undermining his claims to favour lower taxes.
Sunak voted to leave the EU in 2016.
Sajid Javid
Sajid Javid was the first cabinet minister to resign in protest over accusations that Johnson misled the public over what he knew about sexual harassment allegations against a Conservative lawmaker.
A former banker and a champion of free markets, Javid has served in a number of cabinet roles, most recently as health minister. He resigned as Johnson's finance minister in 2020.
The son of Pakistani Muslim immigrant parents, he is a Thatcher admirer and finished fourth in the 2019 leadership contest to replace former Prime Minister Theresa May.
Javid supported remaining in the EU ""with a heavy heart and no enthusiasm"", saying he feared the fallout from a leave vote would add to economic turbulence.
Nadhim Zahawi
The newly appointed finance minister Nadhim Zahawi impressed as vaccines minister when Britain had one of the world's fastest rollouts of COVID shots.
Zahawi's personal story as a former refugee from Iraq who came to Britain as a child sets him apart from other contenders.
He co-founded polling company YouGov before entering parliament in 2010. His last job was as education secretary. Zahawi said last week it would be a ""privilege"" to be prime minister at some stage.
He supported leaving the EU.
Penny Mordaunt
The former defense secretary was sacked by Johnson when he became prime minister after she endorsed his rival, Hunt, during the last leadership contest.
Mordaunt was a passionate supporter of leaving the European Union and made national headlines by taking part in a now-defunct reality TV diving show.
Currently a junior trade minister, Mordaunt called the lockdown-breaking parties in government ""shameful"". She had previously expressed loyalty to Johnson.
Mordaunt campaigned to leave the EU in 2016.
Tom Tugendhat
The chair of parliament's foreign affairs committee, and a former soldier who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, has already indicated he would run in any leadership contest.
He has been a regular critic of Johnson and would offer his party a clean break with previous governments.
However, he is relatively untested because he has never served in cabinet.
He voted to remain in the EU.
Suella Braverman
A Brexit-backing Attorney General, Braverman has said she plans to run for the leadership. She was heavily criticized by lawyers during her tenure after the government sought to break international law over post-Brexit trade rules in Northern Ireland.
She campaigned to leave the EU and served as a junior minister in the Brexit department under May, but resigned in protest at the then prime minister's proposed Brexit deal, saying it did not go far enough in breaking ties with the bloc.",2022-07-07T00:00:00Z,2022,3,25

UNITED NATIONS — The world's problems seized the spotlight Tuesday as the U.N. General Assembly's yearly meeting of world leaders opened with dire assessments of a planet beset by escalating crises and conflicts that an aging international order seems increasingly ill-equipped to tackle.
After two years when many leaders weighed in by video because of the coronavirus pandemic, now presidents, premiers, monarchs and foreign ministers have gathered almost entirely in person for diplomacy's premier global event.
But the tone is far from celebratory. Instead, it's the blare of a tense and worried world.
""We are gridlocked in colossal global dysfunction,"" Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, adding that ""our world is in peril — and paralyzed.""
He and others pointed to conflicts ranging from Russia's six-month-old war in Ukraine to the decadeslong dispute between Israel and the Palestinians. Speakers worried about a changing climate, spiking fuel prices, food shortages, economic inequality, migration, disinformation, discrimination, hate speech, public health and more.
Priorities varied, as did prescriptions for curing humanity's ills. But in a forum dedicated to the idea of bringing the world together, many leaders sounded a common theme: The globe needs cooperation, dialogue and trust, now more than ever.
""We live in an era of uncertainty and shocks,"" Chilean President Gabriel Boric said. ""It is clear nowadays that no country, large or small, humble or powerful, can save itself on its own.""
Or, as Guterres put it, ""Let's work as one, as a coalition of the world, as united nations.""
Let's work as one, as a coalition of the world, as united nations.
–U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres
It's rarely that easy. As Guterres himself noted, geopolitical divisions are undermining the work of the U.N. Security Council, international law, people's trust in democratic institutions, and most forms of international cooperation.
""The divergence between developed and developing countries, between North and South, between the privileged and the rest, is becoming more dangerous by the day,"" the secretary-general said. ""It is at the root of the geopolitical tensions and lack of trust that poison every area of global cooperation, from vaccines to sanctions to trade.""
While appeals to preserve large-scale international cooperation — or multilateralism, in diplomatic parlance — abound, so do different ideas about the balance between working together and standing up for oneself, and about whether an ""international order"" set up after World War II needs reordering.
""We want a multilateralism that is open and respectful of our differences,"" Senegalese President Macky Sall said. He added that the U.N. can win all countries' support only ""on the basis of shared ideals, and not local values erected as universal norms.""
After the pandemic forced an entirely virtual meeting in 2020 and a hybrid one last year, delegates reflecting the world's countries and cultures are once again filling the halls of the United Nations headquarters this week. Before the meeting began, leaders and ministers wearing masks wandered the assembly hall, chatting individually and in groups.
It was a sign that despite the fragmented state of the international community, the United Nations remains the key gathering place for global leaders. Nearly 150 heads of state and government have signed up to speak during the nearly weeklong ""General Debate,"" a high number that illustrates the gathering's distinction as a place to deliver their views and meet privately to discuss various challenges — and, they hope, make some progress.
Guterres made sure to start out by sounding a note of hope. He showed a photo of the first U.N.-chartered ship carrying grain from Ukraine — part of a deal between Ukraine and Russia that the U.N. and Turkey helped broker — to the Horn of Africa, where millions of people are on the edge of famine. It is, he said, an example of promise ""in a world teeming with turmoil.""
Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine topped the agenda for many speakers.
The conflict has become the largest war in Europe since World War II and has opened fissures among major powers in a way not seen since the Cold War. It also has raised fears of a nuclear catastrophe at a large power plant in Ukraine's now Russia-occupied southeast.
Meanwhile, the loss of important grain and fertilizer exports from Ukraine and Russia has triggered a food crisis, especially in developing countries, and inflation and a rising cost of living in many nations.
As Jordan's King Abdullah II noted, well-off countries that are having unfamiliar experiences of scarcity ""are discovering a truth that people in developing countries have known for a long time: For countries to thrive, affordable food must get to every family's table.""
Leaders in many countries are trying to prevent a wider war and restore peace in Europe. Diplomats, though, aren't expecting any breakthroughs this week.
In an impassioned speech to the assembly, French President Emmanuel Macron said no country can stand on the sidelines in the face of Russia's aggression. He accused those who remain silent of being ""in a way complicit with a new cause of imperialism"" that is trampling on the current world order and is making peace impossible.
Slovakian President Zuzana Caputova's country has long depended on Russia for oil and gas. But Slovakia has provided military aid to neighbor Ukraine, she noted.
""We, the members of the U.N., need to clearly side with victim over aggressor,"" she said.
Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, protection of civilians and ""the maintenance of all channels of dialogue between the parties."" But he opposed what he called ""one-sided or unilateral"" Western sanctions, saying they have harmed economic recovery and have threatened human rights of vulnerable populations.""
Neither Ukraine nor Russia has yet had its turn to speak. The assembly has agreed to allow Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to speak by video, over objections from Russia and a few of its allies.
Zelenskyy's speech is expected Wednesday, as is an in-person address from U.S. President Joe Biden. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is due to take the rostrum Saturday.",2022-09-20T00:00:00Z,2022,3,25

NAIROBI, Kenya — Moderna signed a memorandum of understanding with Kenya's government on Monday for the drugmaker's first mRNA vaccine manufacturing facility in Africa, the company said.
The goal is to produce up to 500 million doses of vaccines a year for the African continent, Moderna said in a statement. The focus is on drug substance manufacturing, it said, though the facility could be expanded to include fill-and-finish work.
""In parallel, Moderna is also working on plans to allow it to fill doses of its COVID-19 vaccine in Africa as early as 2023, subject to demand,"" the company said.
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the huge need for vaccine manufacturing on the African continent, which remains the least-vaccinated region in the world against the coronavirus. The continent relies on imports for about 99% of its vaccine needs, the World Health Organization has said.
Frustrated by richer nations' vaccine hoarding, African leaders joined together to pursue the goal of bringing more vaccine manufacturing to the continent of 1.3 billion people.
In October, Senegal and Rwanda signed an agreement with BioNTech for the construction of its first start-to-finish factories to make messenger RNA vaccines in Africa.
The novel mRNA process uses the genetic code for the spike protein of the coronavirus and is thought to trigger a better immune response than traditional vaccines. Scientists hope the technology, which is easier to scale up than traditional vaccine methods, might ultimately be used to make vaccines against other diseases, including malaria.",2022-03-07T00:00:00Z,2022,1,25

WASHINGTON — This year's flu shot appears to be ""a very good match"" to the circulating strains, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said at a news briefing Monday. However, she noted that flu vaccinations are lagging behind the pace of previous years.
Through the end of October, CDC data shows that vaccinations for pregnant women, a group that is more vulnerable to severe illness from influenza, are down about 12% from the same point in 2021.
Vaccination rates for seniors, the age group most likely to be hospitalized with influenza, were down about three percentage points from October 2021.
Flu vaccinations for children are down about 5% compared with where they were before the COVID-19 pandemic, Walensky said.
In a typical year, about 60% of American adults get vaccinated against influenza.
Flu hits the US hard
Flu season has gotten off to an early and severe start in the U.S., with hospitalization rates hitting levels that typically aren't seen until December or January.
""We, of course, look in real time as to how well we think the influenza match is to what is circulating right now. The good news is that looks like it is a very good match,"" Walensky said of the early start to the respiratory virus season.
She noted that the CDC would have more definitive data later in the season but that the data is encouraging.
Walensky said that even when the vaccine doesn't closely match the circulating flu strains, ""We see a 35% decrease in rates of hospitalization ... which really just emphasizes, when we do have a good match, how much more effective it will be.""
CDC data shows that nearly 20,000 people in the United States were admitted to the hospital for flu during the week of Thanksgiving, almost double the number of admissions from the week before.
COVID-19 hospitalizations have ticked up as well, rising 27% in the week after Thanksgiving. But COVID-19 is no longer the only virus straining hospitals.
Just 5% of the U.S. population lives in an area considered to have a high COVID-19 community level.
Walensky said Monday that the CDC was ""actively looking into"" expanding its community levels beyond COVID-19 to include the effects of other viruses, such as the flu.
""In the meantime, what I do want to say is, one need not take wait for CDC action in order to put a mask,"" she said.
People who are sick should stay home and away from others, use good hygiene like covering coughs and washing hands frequently, use a high-quality mask and improve the ventilation in indoor spaces, Walensky said.
Treatment is available
If you do get sick, it's important to get tested, even if you've been vaccinated, said Dr. Sandra Fryhofer, board chair of the American Medical Association and an internal medicine physician in Atlanta.
If you have COVID-19 or the flu, there are antiviral medications for both. But flu antivirals don't work against COVID-19, and vice versa.
""It is going to be a confusing respiratory infections season. Figuring out what's making people sick is going to be a conundrum,"" Fryhofer said.
In response to a question about shortages of key medications during this rough virus season, Walensky said that ""CDC is aware of the reports of some of the shortages for both antivirals as well as antibiotics across the country. I know FDA is working ... with manufacturers to try and explore what can be done to address this.""
She also urged doctors not to prescribe antibiotics for illnesses caused by viruses.
Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, said he and his colleagues have been astonished by the steep increase in flu cases this season. They have also wondered what could be causing it.
He says it's likely that after two years without much flu activity in the U.S., we lost some of our immunity against that virus just as the country has returned to more normal travel and activity patterns.
It is going to be a confusing respiratory infections season. Figuring out what's making people sick is going to be a conundrum.
–Sandra Fryhofer, American Medical Association
""Some of it has got to do with our behaviors in the past, having avoided flu and now opening up our lives to activities such as travel, religious services, getting together with families, going out to entertainment venues and doing all those things that take us into groups,"" he said.
The flu vaccines are good at preventing severe outcomes, he said, but they don't do much to stop the virus' spread.
""It keeps you out of the emergency room, the hospital, the intensive care unit and the cemetery. It's not very good at interrupting transmission, and it is not very good at preventing milder infection,"" he said.
Schaffner says it's likely that flu hospitalizations are going up because the virus is hitting the elderly, who, on the whole, tend to get less protection from vaccinations.
""The vaccine works least well among the population we most want to protect, namely older people, and that's because they have immune systems that are much less robust than the immune systems of younger people.""
Schaffner noted that there are high-dose vaccines for seniors, which are preferred for this age group to help increase their protection.",2022-12-07T00:00:00Z,2022,4,25

BOSTON — As the harmful effects of extended pandemic school closures become more apparent, some educators and parents have regrets.
They're questioning decisions in cities across the U.S. to remain online long after clear evidence emerged that schools weren't COVID-19 super-spreaders — and months after life-saving adult vaccines became widely available.
In Chicago, Marla Williams initially supported the school system's decision to instruct students online during the fall of 2020. Williams, a single mother, has asthma, as do her two children. While she was working, she enlisted her father, a retired teacher, to supervise her children's studies. It didn't work.
Her son lost motivation and wouldn't do his assignments. Once he went back on a hybrid schedule in spring 2021, he started doing well again.
""I wish we'd been in person earlier,"" Williams said. ""Other schools seemed to be doing it successfully.""
There are fears for the futures of students who don't catch up. They run the risk of never learning to read, long a precursor for dropping out of school. They might never master simple algebra, putting science and tech fields out of reach. The pandemic decline in college attendance could continue to accelerate, crippling the U.S. economy.
In a sign of how inflammatory the debate has become, there's sharp disagreement even about how to label the problems created by online school. ""Learning loss"" has become a lightning rod. Some fear it might brand struggling students or cast blame on teachers, and they say it overlooks the need to save lives during a pandemic.
Regardless of what it's called, the casualties of Zoom school are real.
The scale of the problem and the challenges in addressing it were apparent in Associated Press interviews with nearly 50 school leaders, teachers, parents and health officials, who struggled to agree on a way forward.
Some warned against second-guessing the school closures for a virus that killed over a million people in the U.S. More than 200,000 children lost at least one parent.
""It is very easy with hindsight to say, 'Oh, learning loss, we should have opened.' People forget how many people died,"" said Austin Beutner, former superintendent in Los Angeles, where students were online from March 2020 until the start of hybrid instruction in April 2021.
It is very easy with hindsight to say, 'Oh, learning loss, we should have opened.' People forget how many people died.
–Austin Beutner, former superintendent in Los Angeles
The question isn't merely academic. It's conceivable another pandemic might emerge — or a different crisis.
But there's another reason for asking what lessons have been learned: the kids who have fallen behind. Some third graders struggle to sound out words. Some ninth graders have given up on school because they feel so behind they can't catch up. The future of American children hangs in the balance.
When COVID-19 first reached the U.S., scientists didn't fully understand how it spread or whether it was harmful to children. American schools, like most around the world, understandably shuttered in March 2020.
That summer, scientists learned kids didn't face the same risks as adults, but experts couldn't decide how to operate schools safely.
The risk assessment varied depending on how vulnerable a community felt to the virus. Politics was a factor, too. Districts that reopened in person tended to be in areas that voted for President Donald Trump or had largely white populations.
By winter, studies showed schools weren't contributing to increased COVID-19 spread in the community. Classes with masked students and distancing could be conducted safely, growing evidence said. Once the vaccine was available, some Democratic-leaning districts started to reopen.
Yet many schools stayed closed well into the spring, including in California, where the state's powerful teachers unions fought returning to classrooms, citing lack of safety protocols.
Nationally, kids whose schools met mostly online in the 2020-2021 school year performed 13 percentage points lower in math and 8 percentage points lower in reading compared with schools meeting mostly in person, according to a 2022 study by Brown University economist Emily Oster.
The setbacks have some grappling with regret.
""I can't imagine a situation where we would close schools again, unless there's a virus attacking kids,"" said Eric Conti, superintendent for Burlington, Massachusetts.
Still, many school officials said with hindsight they'd make the same decision to keep schools online well into 2021. Only two superintendents said they'd likely make a different decision if there were another pandemic that was not particularly dangerous to children.
In some communities, demographics and the historic underinvestment in schools loomed large. In the South, Black Americans' fear of the virus was sometimes coupled with mistrust of schools rooted in segregation. Cities from Atlanta to Nashville to Jackson, Mississippi, shuttered schools — in some cases, for nearly all of the 2020-2021 school year.
In Clayton County, Georgia, home to the state's highest percentage of Black residents, schools chief Morcease Beasley said he knew closing schools would have a devastating impact, but the fear in his community was overwhelming.
""I knew teachers couldn't teach if they were that scared, and students couldn't learn,"" he said.
Among teachers, there's some dispute about online learning's impact on children. But many fear some students will be scarred for years.
""Should we have reopened earlier? Absolutely,"" said California teacher Sarah Curry. She initially favored school closings in her rural Central Valley district, but grew frustrated with the duration of distance learning.
But the nation's 3 million public school teachers are far from a monolith.
Jessica Cross, who taught ninth grade math on Chicago's west side at Phoenix Military Academy, feels her school reopened too soon.
""I didn't feel entirely safe,"" she said. Mask rules were good in theory, but not all students wore them properly. She said safety should come before academics.
A representative from the American Federation of Teachers declined in an interview to address whether the union regrets the positions teachers took against reopening schools.
""If we start to play the blame game,"" said Fedrick Ingram, AFT's secretary-treasurer, ""we get into the political fray of trying to determine if teachers did a good job or not. And I don't think that's fair.""
Regrets or no, experts agree: America's kids need more from adults if they're going to be made whole.
The country needs ""ideally, a reinvention of public education as we know it,"" Los Angeles Superintendent Alberto Carvalho said. Students need more days in school and smaller classes.
Short of extending the school year, experts say intensive tutoring is the most efficient way to help students catch up. Saturday school or doubling up on math or reading during a regular school day would also help.
Too few school districts have made those investments, Harvard economist Tom Kane said. Summer school is insufficient, Kane says — it's voluntary, and many parents don't sign up.

SALT LAKE CITY — Utah parents are being advised not to overreact to a new study from New York showing that it took just over a month for the COVID-19 vaccine to offer children 5-11 years old virtually no protection from getting the virus while becoming less than 50% effective at keeping them out of the hospital.
""This is one study. Science is very much something where it's important to look at many pieces of information before we draw conclusions that directly impact what we're going to do,"" state epidemiologist Dr. Leisha Nolen said Tuesday, adding she wants to see what's happening in other places before accepting the results.
""Don't take this as absolute fact,"" she said. ""Take this as good information that we really need to look into further.""
Nolen said the Utah Department of Health continues to recommend parents get their children vaccinated against COVID-19, even as the state moves toward treating the virus more like the flu or other endemic disease that remains deadly but is not as widespread.
""It's always good to be prepared,"" she said, for another wave of COVID-19 that's ""pretty certain"" to hit at some point.
And even if the data from New York suggests the vaccines may not stop young children from getting the virus, Nolen said ""happily, they still have a reasonable protection against hospitalization. We know that's what we're really aiming for, right? We want to keep kids out of the hospital.""
The study, posted Monday by doctors and researchers at the New York State Department of Health and the University at Albany School of Public Health in New York, found that in fully vaccinated children ages 5-11, the vaccine's protection against COVID-19 infections fell from 68% in mid-December to just 12% by the end of January.
Don't take this as absolute fact. Take this as good information that we really need to look into further.
–Dr. Leisha Nolen, state epidemiologist
When it came to preventing hospitalization during the surge of the incredibly transmissible omicron variant of the virus over the same time period, the two reduced doses of the Pfizer vaccine approved for that age group dropped in effectiveness from 100% to 48%.
For fully vaccinated adolescents and teens ages 12-17, the study found the declines in vaccine effectiveness during those weeks weren't as steep, with protection against infection dropping from 66% to 51% and protection against severe illness falling from 85% to 73%.
A big difference in the vaccine's effectiveness against infection between ages 11 and 12 — the study found in the week ending Jan. 30 that it was down to 11% for 11-year-olds versus 67% for 12-year-olds — suggest the size of the dose may be a problem. Children 5-11 receive 1/3 the dose given those 12 and older.
The new data follows disappointing results from clinical trials of an even smaller dose of the Pfizer vaccine in children under 5 years old. Last month, the Food and Drug Administration postponed a decision on whether to approve the shots for children as young as 6 months old until a study on the need for a third dose is completed.
Nolen said it's always a challenge to determine the proper dosage for children, and both the new study and the clinical trials support looking at whether the amount of vaccine needs to be adjusted for younger children and booster shots offered. Currently, booster shots are available only to those 12 and older.
Her issues with the New York study include what she said is a greater likelihood that children who are vaccinated against the virus would be tested if they show symptoms, possibly skewing the results, as well as the results of home testing not being included since they're not reported to the government.
COVID-19 vaccinations have slowed in Utah since the peak of the omicron surge here, when cases rose about 13,000 a day and testing sites were so overwhelmed that Gov. Spencer Cox urged most Utahns with symptoms to skip the swab and simply stay home until they felt better.
Currently, 61% of all Utahns are fully vaccinated, meaning it's been two weeks or more since their initial series of shots — two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, or a single dose of Johnson & Johnson. But only 27% of Utah children aged 5-11 have gotten both doses of Pfizer, the only choice in the United States for those under 17.
Nolen said there's always a concern that questions raised about the effectiveness of vaccines in children could keep parents from scheduling their shots.
""We do want to make sure people see there is still a benefit,"" she said, describing the latest study as an example of being transparent about vaccines. ""We're not hiding data. We're not trying to bias people's understanding. It's out there.""",2022-03-01T00:00:00Z,2022,1,25

NHL teams are taking different approaches to crossing the U.S.-Canada border during the first round of the playoffs with the U.S. still requiring a negative COVID-19 test for all passengers arriving on international flights.
The Edmonton Oilers flew to Vancouver and took buses into Washington state before flying to Los Angeles to avoid U.S. virus testing requirements, and the Toronto Maple Leafs took buses to Buffalo, New York, before flying to Florida for the same reason. The Tampa Bay Lightning, Dallas Stars, Los Angeles Kings and Calgary Flames all opted to test and fly direct when their respective series shifted from Canada to the U.S. late this week.
Choose your own travel adventure has become the latest pandemic wrinkle to the fight for the Stanley Cup. Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said the NHL did not make any particular recommendations but has no problem with the creative arrangements.
""We have no objection or issue with them utilizing the rules and policies that have been put in place by the applicable health authorities to their maximum advantage,"" Daly said in an email Friday.
The situation is nothing like the past two years when cross-border travel was a major headache for the NHL. In 2020, the league held a 24-team postseason in Toronto and Edmonton with strict quarantines in place and no fans. Last year, facing uncertainty over border restrictions, the league temporarily realigned its divisions for a shortened season, with all seven Canadian teams playing only each other through the first two rounds of the playoffs.
Oilers coach Jay Woodcroft said players were involved in choosing the itinerary for what amounted to a longer trip. The Oilers spent a night in a Vancouver hotel before crossing the border and flying from Bellingham, Washington, to California on Thursday ahead of Game 3 against the Kings on Friday night.
""I think what you want to do is you want to make the best decision possible for your group and was one that we gave a lot of thought to,"" Woodcroft said. ""The players are energized by how we traveled and being in the California sunshine.""
The Oilers have the only unvaccinated player in the NHL playoffs: Josh Archibald, whose cardiologist was able to secure a medical exemption for the 29-year-old forward because of a heart condition known as myocarditis. Archibald played in only eight games during the regular season but is available in the playoffs on either side of the border and was in the lineup for Game 2 when Edmonton evened its series against the Kings.
The Maple Leafs' trip to Buffalo took only a couple of hours before flying to Florida. It's the same path the NBA's Toronto Raptors took during their first-round series against Philadelphia.
The Lightning, Kings, Stars, and Flames all chose COVID-19 testing and a direct flight to enter the U.S.
""We didn't cross the border by bus,"" Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper said Friday before Game 3 against Toronto. ""Everybody passed the tests.""

UNITED NATIONS — Facing a complex set of challenges that try humanity as never before, world leaders convene at the United Nations this week under the shadow of Europe's first major war since World War II — a conflict that has unleashed a global food crisis and divided major powers in a way not seen since the Cold War.
The many facets of the Ukraine war are expected to dominate the annual meeting, which convenes as many countries and peoples confront growing inequality, an escalating climate crisis, the threat of multiple famines and an internet-fueled tide of misinformation and hate speech — all atop a coronavirus pandemic that is halfway through its third year.
For the first time since the United Nations was founded atop the ashes of World War II, European nations are witnessing war in their midst waged by nuclear-armed neighboring Russia. Its Feb. 24 invasion not only threatens Ukraine's survival as an independent democratic nation but has leaders in many countries worrying about trying to preserve regional and international peace and prevent a wider war.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the strategic divides — with the West on one side and Russia and increasingly China on the other — are ""paralyzing the global response to the dramatic challenges we face.""
He pointed not only to the devastation in Ukraine from nearly seven months of fighting but the war's impact on the global economy.
Escalating food and energy prices are hitting the world's poorest people hardest, and nations are ""being devoured by the acids of nationalism and self-interest"" instead of working together and resolving disputes peacefully, two principles that lie at the heart of the U.N. Charter and underpin everything the United Nations tries to do.
""The General Assembly is meeting at a time of great peril,"" the U.N. chief said last week.
For the first time in three years, leaders will be delivering their speeches in person in the vast General Assembly hall. There will be no more COVID-caused prerecorded addresses or hybrid meetings, with one exception: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
Over objections from Russia and a few allies, the 193-member assembly voted overwhelmingly Friday to allow the Ukrainian leader to pre-record his speech because of reasons beyond his control — the ""ongoing foreign invasion"" and military hostilities that require him to carry out his ""national defense and security duties.""
The death of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and her funeral in London on Monday, which many world leaders plan to attend, have created last-minute headaches for the high-level meeting. Diplomats and U.N. staff are scrambling to deal with changes in travel plans, the timing of some events and the logistically intricate speaking schedule for world leaders.
Guterres is skipping the funeral to preside over Monday's ""Transforming Education Summit"" that he called to create action on a U.N. goal to ensure quality education for all children by 2030 that lost significant ground during the pandemic.
The actual gathering of world leaders, known as the General Debate, begins Tuesday morning with the U.N. chief's state of the world speech to the 77th session of the General Assembly which began on Sept. 12. Brazil has spoken first for over seven decades because at the early General Assembly sessions it volunteered to speak first when no other country did.
The U.S. president, representing the host country for the United Nations, is traditionally the second speaker. But President Joe Biden is attending the queen's funeral, and his speech has been delayed until Wednesday morning. Senegalese President Macky Sall is expected to take Biden's slot.
Nearly 150 presidents, prime ministers and monarchs are on the latest speakers list, a very high number reflecting the importance of the meeting not only for presenting every country's view of the world but for private one-on-one and group meetings where diplomats say a lot of the world's business is carried out.
In addition to Zelenskyy, Biden and Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, other heads of state coming to the U.N. include the presidents of Turkey, Iran, France, Colombia, South Korea, South Africa, Egypt and Venezuela. Heads of government on the list include Britain's new Prime Minister Liz Truss, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also making a first appearance, and the prime ministers of Japan, Israel, Iraq and Pakistan. Russia and China are sending their foreign ministers.
For many years, foreign ministers of the five veto-wielding permanent members of the U.N. Security Council — the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France — have met on the sidelines for lunch or dinner. Diplomats said no meeting is planned this year.
During typical high-level weeks, thousands of people are in the U.N. complex for speeches and hundreds of side events. But because of the continuing pandemic, this year only the few events organized by the secretary-general and the General Assembly president are being held at U.N. headquarters. Dozens of side events will take place elsewhere in the city.
My message to world leaders gathering here is clear: Lower the temperature — now. ... Don't flood the world today; don't drown it tomorrow.
–U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres
Richard Gowan, U.N. director of the International Crisis Group, said Ukraine and the food crisis will be the two ""overarching themes"" and the message from Western leaders is going to be clear: ""This is Russia's war of aggression and this is a huge attack on the U.N. system.""
A highlight will be the U.N. Security Council ministerial meeting on Sept. 22 focusing on the fight against impunity in the war in Ukraine — a topic decided by France which holds the council presidency this month. The meeting could put foreign ministers of the five permanent council nations in the same room with Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who has been invited.
France's U.N. ambassador, Nicolas De Riviere, said Friday that ""perpetrators will be held accountable"" for the ""dramatic consequences"" that ""the Russian war of aggression"" has had on civilians in Ukraine. And U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the United Nations faces ""a crisis of confidence"" brought about by Russia's invasion of Ukraine that violated its neighbor's sovereignty and territorial integrity, ""trampled on human rights"" and struck at the heart of the U.N. Charter by pursuing war instead of a negotiated peace.
She told reporters Friday that the response must be to ""double down on our commitment to a peaceful world and hold even closer our deeply-held principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, peace and security.""
Thomas-Greenfield insisted the high-level meeting ""will not be dominated by Ukraine"" because there are conflicts taking place elsewhere as well. That's why she says the United States is focusing on tackling the food crisis as well as climate change, advancing global health and upholding the U.N. Charter.
The Crisis Group's Gowan said his organization has seen in recent weeks that African and Latin American countries ""have gradually succumbed to Ukraine fatigue,"" and there is a feeling in many parts of the U.N. ""that countries don't want to have to constantly attack Russia."" There is a clear understanding among Western leaders, and especially in the U.S., of the need ""to keep non-Western countries on board over Ukraine,"" he said.
Gowan said he will also be listening for ""an undercurrent of discontent"" from African nations and countries from the global South about how they've been let down on COVID-19 vaccinations and financing to tackle climate change and deal with escalating food prices and the cost of living. He also lamented that crises in Mali, Afghanistan and Yemen won't be on the front burner.
Secretary-General Guterres, who just visited Pakistan where he said the flooded area is three times the size of his home country Portugal, lashed out at the Group of 20 richest nations, which he said are responsible for 80% of emissions that cause global warming.
""My message to world leaders gathering here is clear: Lower the temperature — now,"" he said. ""Don't flood the world today; don't drown it tomorrow.""",2022-09-18T00:00:00Z,2022,3,25

What's next for Arizona State? Utah is what's next.
Days after the upheaval caused by their coaching change, the Sun Devils must prepare for the worst possible opponent to face under the circumstances.
No team inflicts more punishment, no team intends greater brutality or makes opponents fight for every inch of turf quite like the Utes.
The defending Pac-12 champions have won nine of their past 10 conference games — and by an average margin of 21 points. The stretch includes a second-half steamrollering of ASU in the middle of last season that gave Utah control of the South division.
How will ASU handle the inevitable assault Saturday night, less than one week after Herm Edwards ""relinquished"" his post atop the program?
For that matter, how will the Sun Devils handle the next two months?
Fortunately, two in-season coaching changes a year ago provide us with a broad framework from which to observe.
On one end of the spectrum: USC.
The Trojans canned Clay Helton after a Week Two loss to Stanford, promoted assistant Donte Williams to the role of interim coach and proceeded to flounder and flail.
After a brief post-tumult bounce (a blowout win at Washington State), the Trojans dropped seven of nine and were embarrassed repeatedly.
Meanwhile, Washington State followed a different path. The school fired Nick Rolovich in mid-October for failing to comply with the state vaccine mandate.
After an emotional week and close loss to BYU, the Cougars won three of their last four, smacked Washington around, nearly claimed the North title and went bowling.
One team won immediately after parting ways with its coach, then regressed.
The other struggled initially, then finished with a flourish.
We won't attempt to guess how the Sun Devils react under interim coach Shaun Aguano, except to caution against quick conclusions.
The schedule is rugged, with three consecutive games against ranked opponents: No. 13 Utah, No. 7 USC and No. 18 Washington.
At the end of the triple-whammy comes a bye, at which point Aguano will be able to step back, assess his team's psyche, reset expectations (if necessary), and prepare for the stretch run.
Like Washington State, the Sun Devils have plenty to play for — win five of nine, and they're bowl-eligible.
But as we saw with USC, urgency can disappear quickly when the players know the current boss isn't the future boss.
To the picks …
Last week: 4-5Season: 9-15Five-star special: 2-1
Spreads taken from BetMGM (as of 6:30 a.m. Wednesday) Game totals in parenthesis All times Pacific
UCLA at Colorado
Kickoff: 11 a.m. on Pac-12 NetworksLine: UCLA -22.5 (total: 57.5)Comment: After the narrow escape from South Alabama and with Washington coming to town next Friday night, the Bruins would be facing a classic trap situation here — except CU doesn't have the teeth to take advantage. We're most intrigued by the Buffaloes' choice of quarterbacks and whether promising freshman Owen McCown can inject life into the program and the season.Pick: UCLA
Oregon at Washington State
Kickoff: 1 p.m. on FOXLine: Oregon -6.5 (total: 57.5)Comment: WSU's ownership of the Ducks disappeared when Mike Leach departed for Mississippi State, but this stacks up as a closer game than we've witnessed in either of the past two years (both Oregon wins). Two new quarterbacks plus two stout defenses plus two teams with designs on a berth in the conference championship equals one must-see affair. Our guess: It comes down to the kicking game.Pick: Washington State
Arizona at Cal
Kickoff: 2:30 p.m. on Pac-12 NetworksLine: Cal -3 (total: 50.5)Comment: This has quietly been one of the best series in the conference dating to the four-overtime epic in 1996. Each of the past seven meetings has been decided by one possession, and this edition should make it eight in a row. The line opened with the Bears as a 4.5-point favorite and has understandably moved toward even. The quarterbacks (Cal's Jack Plummer and Arizona's Jayden de Laura) are just erratic enough to make mayhem possible.Pick: Arizona
USC at Oregon State
Kickoff: 6:30 p.m. on Pac-12 NetworksLine: USC -6.5 (total: 70.5)Comment: The only game of the week matching undefeated teams was passed over by ESPN and Fox, hence its unfortunate position on the Pac-12 Networks. The Beavers' hot start has created circumstances similar to 2006 and 2008, when OSU toppled the mighty Carroll-era Trojans. But this strikes us as the perfect opportunity for USC's sensational offense and disruptive defense to produce a crowd-silencing show of force.Pick: USC
Stanford at Washington
Kickoff: 7:30 p.m. on FS1Line: Washington -14 (total: 63.5)Comment: The Cardinal had two weeks to prepare while Washington must recalibrate after a stirring win over Michigan State — a significant edge in preparation for the visitors. Add Stanford's first-rate passing game and recent history of success against UW, and we view the point spread as being too high by a touchdown. (The line opened at 9.5, by the way.) The best play here is the Over. Neither team will stop the other.Pick: Stanford
Utah at Arizona State
Kickoff: 7:30 p.m. on ESPNLine: Utah -14.5 (total: 54)Comment: The initial line had Utah favored by 5.5 points, then Edwards was fired and the betting public heaved money in Utah's direction. ASU's emotional state adds an element of the unknown, but this much is apparent: The same defense that allowed Eastern Michigan to rush for 305 yards last weekend now must stop the most physical running game in the conference. We don't see ASU holding up for four quarters, and maybe not for three.Pick: Utah
Straight-up winners: UCLA, Oregon, Cal, USC, Stanford and Utah
Five-star special: Stanford. There will be no middle ground in Seattle: Either the Cardinal conjures a major upset or the Huskies keep rolling and end it early. We like the former.",2022-09-21T00:00:00Z,2022,3,25

SALT LAKE CITY — The federal government on Thursday declared a public health emergency in the face of the monkeypox outbreak that has now infected more than 7,000 Americans.
Universities around the state will be kicking off the fall semester later this month, marking a return to the Beehive State for students all across the world.
With an influx of people coming to the state — some living in dorms or close-quarter situations — here's how Utah's higher education institutions are preparing for students' return and how they're equipping themselves to handle a monkeypox outbreak.
Utah Valley University
As the largest university in the state, with over 41,000 students, Utah Valley University has been monitoring monkeypox ""for several weeks"" and will continue to do so.
""We are in contact with the Utah County Health Department as a part of the monitoring process,"" said Robin Ebmeyer, director of emergency management and safety at UVU.
Ebmeyer noted that UVU has a strong relationship with the county health department after working through the COVID-19 pandemic together.
Currently, there isn't a high concentration of monkeypox in Utah County — only four cases, according to Utah Department of Health and Human Services data.
""We are updating our student health services regarding case counts and vaccination availability,"" Ebmeyer said. ""We are working on a document that will be available for students, staff and faculty, regarding monkeypox; and it will be available on our website.""
This document will contain information on the disease, how to lessen the chance of contracting it, as well as necessary steps to take if there is a concern.
""Our focus at this time is monitoring and getting appropriate information to our campus community,"" Ebmeyer said.
Brigham Young University
Brigham Young University is handling monkeypox similarly to its neighbors to the north.
Right now, BYU's focus is on working closely with state and local agencies to plan for and mitigate the disease.
""Our plan is to follow the direction of public health professionals within the Utah Department of Health and the Utah County Health Department,"" said Todd Hollingshead, media relations manager at BYU.
Utah State University
As of Friday, the Utah Department of Health and Human Services wasn't reporting any monkeypox cases in Cache County.
Despite this, Amanda DeRito, spokeswoman for Utah State University, said the disease is ""on everyone's radar.""
""At Utah State University, we look to our state and local public health officials for guidance, as we do in all situations involving infectious diseases,"" DeRito said.
She added that tests and vaccines for monkeypox are in short supply and not currently available at USU's campus.
""Anyone experiencing symptoms of monkeypox should see their health care provider,"" DeRito said. ""Students on the Logan campus can reach out to the USU Student Health Center.""

Weber State University
As of Wednesday, there were three confirmed cases of monkeypox in Weber and Morgan counties, the Utah Department of Health and Human Services said.
Weber State University officials said they are prepared to handle the disease through lessons learned over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Weber State has time-tested protocols for emerging health crises, many of which we successfully employed early on and during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Bryan Magaña, director of public relations at WSU.
This includes routine and detailed updates to ensure their students, faculty, staff and the surrounding community remain informed and safe.
""Our health and safety experts are currently working on more detailed plans should the monkeypox health crisis evolve into an epidemic or pandemic,"" Magaña said. ""For all public health concerns, (university) housing works closely with the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, as well as WSU Public Safety, to develop and execute plans to keep students safe.""
He added that WSU's plans incorporate the latest guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Southern Utah University
David Bishop, Southern Utah University's director of public relations, told KSL.com the Cedar City university is monitoring what's going on both nationally and statewide with monkeypox.
""We're going to rely heavily on the guidance that we get from state and federal health officials,"" Bishop said. ""That's going to be our guiding force on this or any other pandemic that may be out there.""
He added that the university has had preliminary discussions about handling the disease but hasn't developed any action plans quite yet.
""To the best of our knowledge, there have been no cases in southern Utah,"" Bishop said. ""We're in preliminary discussions on what to do if we have a case of monkeypox here on campus.""
Utah Tech University
Similar to the northern Utah institutions, Utah's southernmost university depends on ""health authorities' expertise to determine if a response to a health concern is necessary,"" said Jyl Hall, Utah Tech University's director of public relations.
""Utah Tech has not received any direction from our local or state health departments or the CDC indicating a need to initiate a monkeypox response plan,"" Hall said.
Statewide numbers
As of Wednesday, 43 confirmed and probable cases of monkeypox had been reported in Utah, according to the Utah Department of Health and Human Services.
Case counts by county are as follows:
- Davis County: 2
- Salt Lake County: 34
- Utah County: 4
- Weber and Morgan counties: 3
The state health department has advised the best way to prevent infection is to have people with the infection avoid transmitting it to others.
""This means not coming into contact with other people while the rash is present. The rash can look like pimples or blisters and can appear on any part of the body. If you notice an unusual rash, seek testing from your medical provider and avoid exposing others,"" according to a news release from the health department.
Additionally, vaccines and tests for the disease are in low supply, and the health department expects that to be the case ""for the foreseeable future.""
The agency ""is tracking the virus, collecting data from local health departments, coordinating distribution of vaccines, and providing information to providers about how to recognize and initiate testing for the virus,"" the release says.
Rebecca Walsh, associate director of communications at the University of Utah, told KSL.com that University of Utah Health will have information regarding monkeypox available next week.",2022-08-07T00:00:00Z,2022,3,25

WASHINGTON — Vaccinating pregnant women against the coronavirus may help prevent COVID-19 hospitalizations in infants after they are born, especially if the expecting mothers got the shots later in their pregnancy, U.S. researchers reported on Tuesday.
The findings shed light on whether the benefits of vaccination during pregnancy extend to infants who would be too young to receive vaccines.
Researchers from several pediatric hospitals and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looked at children under 6 months old between July 2021 and January 2022.
The study analyzed data from 379 hospitalized infants — 176 with COVID-19 and 203 who were admitted for other issues. It found that COVID-19 vaccines were 61% effective overall at preventing hospitalizations in children whose mothers were vaccinated during pregnancy.
That protection rose to 80% when the mothers were vaccinated 21 weeks through 14 days before delivery. Vaccination effectiveness fell to 32% for the babies whose mothers were inoculated earlier during pregnancy.
The study authors warned that the estimates for effectiveness earlier in pregnancy should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size.
""Right now, we want to ensure that we are protecting both the mom and the infant,"" CDC's Dana Meaney-Delman told reporters. ""So as soon as a pregnant woman is willing to be vaccinated, she should go ahead and do so.""
Pregnant women are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, and having COVID during pregnancy can increase the risk of preterm birth, stillbirth and possibly other pregnancy complications, according to the CDC.
The CDC recommends that women who are pregnant, are breastfeeding, are trying to get pregnant now, or might become pregnant in the future get vaccinated and stay up to date with COVID-19 shots.
Previous studies have shown that COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy was not associated with preterm delivery or underweight newborns.",2022-02-16T00:00:00Z,2022,1,25

PHILADELPHIA — Pascal Siakam gave a pregame pep talk to keep the Raptors calm in a hostile Philly environment where they already lost twice and fell into a playoff hole.
The message was simple: ""Listen to our voices.""
How do they like the sound of this? The resilient Raptors are headed home, still with a chance to pull off a series comeback that's never happened in the NBA.
Siakam had 23 points and 10 rebounds, Precious Achiuwa scored 17 and the Toronto Raptors forced a return home for Game 6 in their Eastern Conference first-round series against Philadelphia, beating the 76ers 103-88 on Monday night.
""We always kind of figure it out,"" Siakam said.
Yo, Canada! Once holding a 3-0 series lead, the 76ers are headed back north.
No team has ever blown a 3-0 advantage and lost a playoff series.
The Raptors have won two straight in the series and jumped all over injured Sixers center Joel Embiid and ineffective James Harden to make Thursday night's game a necessity.
FanDuel Sportsbook has the Sixers favored by 1 1/2 points for Game 6.
Embiid had 20 points and 11 rebounds playing with a thumb injury. Harden scored 15 points on 4-of-11 shooting.
""I was terrible defensively,"" Embiid said. ""There's really no explanation. I've just got to play with more energy, move my feet better. I've just got to be better.""
Rapper and famous 76ers fan Meek Mill pulled his hood over his head and walked off from his courtside seat late in the game and the home team down 14.
Sixers coach Doc Rivers is dragging the weight of ignominious NBA history with him through customs. Rivers, who led Boston to the 2008 championship, is the only coach in NBA history to blow three 3-1 series leads. The Magic lost to Detroit in the 2003 Eastern Conference first round; the 2015 Clippers blew the series to Houston in the Western Conference semifinals; and in 2020, the Clippers lost to Denver in the West semifinals.
The next season, Rivers was in Philly -- and the Sixers lost three games at home as the No. 1 seed and were eliminated in the second round.
The nerves in Philly are suddenly as tight as the rims.
""We never brought the fight to them at the beginning of the game, really,"" 76ers forward Tobias Harris said.
The Sixers had a miserable first half. They finished with 10 turnovers and shot 35% from the floor. Philly's last bucket in the first quarter was one for the blooper reel: Matisse Thybulle's missed shot bounced off the rim and was accidentally tipped in by Achiuwa.
Whoops.
Maybe it sparked something for the Raptors. They opened the second quarter on a 12-0 run to take control all while the Sixers missed their first nine shots. The Sixers didn't score until 6:51 was left in the half. Scottie Barnes scored eight points in the quarter and the Raptors took a 54-41 lead at the break.
""They were the tougher team all night, they were more physical all night,"" Rivers said. ""I don't think it was the second quarter. I thought it was throughout the game.""
The 76ers were booed off the court, their play a bleak reminder of recent postseason flameouts.
""We've generated really good shots most of the series,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said before the game. ""We haven't shot very well yet. I told the guys today, today would be a good day to go ahead and start making some of those open shots.""
The Raptors listened, hovering around 50% for most of the game. They also controlled the boards and scored 20 points off 16 turnovers.
Harden could have used the shooting tip.
Harden played the same night the All-Star he was traded for, Ben Simmons, was inactive for Brooklyn. Harden was barely more visible and missed 6 of 8 shots through three quarters, scoring nine points.
Embiid continued to play with a ligament tear in his right thumb. He looked gassed at times in the third quarter as the Raptors kept attacking the MVP finalist for tough buckets, notably Achiuwa's driving layup that made it 73-60.
Embiid had his own rallying cry for the 76ers: Get back to the kind of play that earned them the 3-0 lead.
""It's the same recipe. Don't turn the ball over. Offensive rebound. We've definitely got to be better defensively,"" he said. ""There's a reason we won three games in a row.""
OG Anunoby and Gary Trent Jr. each scored 16 points for the Raptors.
""Not exactly the way we would draw it up, but we're happy to still be playing,"" Nurse said.
TIP-INS
Raptors: All-Star point guard Fred VanVleet sat out with a left hip flexor strain. VanVleet said he was hurt in Game 4 and was unsure if he could play in Game 6.
76ers: Embiid was fined $15,000 for criticizing the officiating in Game 4. ... John Calipari, who coached 76ers guard Tyrese Maxey at Kentucky, was at the game.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Embiid will have to wait until after the season for thumb surgery.
""There's no treatment. There really isn't,"" Rivers said. ""If there's one thing I know, it's not going to get any worse. There's really no ice, there's no treatment for that until after the season.""
CAN'T CLOSE
Rivers has lost seven of his last eight opportunities to close out a series. His 31 losses in those games are already the most by a coach in NBA history.
UP NEXT
The Sixers will play Game 6 without Thybulle. Thybulle, who sat out Games 3 and 4, is barred from entering Canada because he is not fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

WASHINGTON — TikTok may be the platform of choice for catchy videos, but anyone using it to learn about COVID-19, climate change or Russia's invasion of Ukraine is likely to encounter misleading information, according to a research report published Wednesday.
Researchers at NewsGuard searched for content about prominent news topics on TikTok and say they found that nearly 1 in 5 of the videos automatically suggested by the platform contained misinformation.
Searches for information about ""mRNA vaccine,"" for instance, yielded five videos (out of the first 10) that contained misinformation, including baseless claims that the COVID-19 vaccine causes ""permanent damage in children's critical organs.""
Researchers looking for information about abortion, the 2020 election, the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, climate change or Russia's invasion of Ukraine on TikTok found similarly misleading videos scattered among more accurate clips.
The amount of misinformation — and the ease with which it can be found — is especially troubling given TikTok's popularity with young people, according to Steven Brill, founder of NewsGuard, a firm that monitors misinformation.
TikTok is the second most popular domain in the world, according to online performance and security company Cloudflare, exceeded only by Google.
Brill questioned whether ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, is doing enough to stop misinformation or whether it deliberately allows misinformation to proliferate as a way to sow confusion in the U.S. and other Western democracies.
""It's either incompetence or it's something worse,"" Brill told The Associated Press.
TikTok released a statement in response to NewsGuard's report noting that its community guidelines prohibit harmful misinformation and that it works to promote authoritative content about important topics like COVID-19.
""We do not allow harmful misinformation, including medical misinformation, and we will remove it from the platform,"" the company said.
TikTok has taken other steps that it says are intended to direct users to trustworthy sources. This year, for example, the company created an election center to help U.S. voters find voting places or information about candidates.
The platform removed more than 102 million videos that violated its rules in the first quarter of 2022. Yet only a tiny percentage of those ran afoul of TikTok's rules against misinformation.
Researchers found that TikTok's own search tool seems designed to steer users to false claims in some cases. When researchers typed the words ""COVID vaccine"" into the search tool, for instance, the tool suggested searches on key words including ""COVID vaccine exposed"" and ""COVID vaccine injury.""
When the same search was run on Google, however, that search engine suggested searches relating to more accurate information about vaccine clinics, the different types of vaccines and booster shots.
TikTok's rise in popularity has caught the attention of state officials and federal lawmakers, some of whom have expressed concerns about its data privacy and security.
The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee will hold a hearing Wednesday on social media's impact on the nation's security. TikTok's chief operating officer, Vanessa Pappas, is set to testify alongside representatives from YouTube, Twitter and Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook.",2022-09-18T00:00:00Z,2022,3,25

SALT LAKE CITY — Health officials are warning residents to avoid contact with wild animals after a bat found in Salt Lake City tested positive for rabies.
In a news release Thursday, the Salt Lake County Health Department said only a small percentage of bats carry rabies, but residents should avoid contact because rabies can only be confirmed with a laboratory test after an animal has died.
The Salt Lake Valley is home to several species of bats, and other species migrate through the area, so it is not unusual to find bats hanging upside down from buildings or trees. Officials said healthy bats generally avoid people and pose no threat to humans.
Rabid bats, on the other hand, ""may behave unusually, such as entering areas they would usually avoid or spending time on the ground,"" the news release states. ""They may also be weak, dehydrated or unable to fly, making them more approachable than usual.""
If you find a bat on the ground or other unusual place, health officials say to do the following:
- Do not touch it.
- Keep children and pets away.
- Report the bat's location to your local animal control agency.
Officials also say to call the county health department at 385-468-4222 to be evaluated for receiving the rabies vaccine if you've had contact with a bat, or if a bat has been inside the living area of your home.
A similar incident occurred earlier this week when the TriCounty Health Department received reports of a possibly diseased bat at Dinosaur National Monument on or around May 28. That department is looking for any visitors who may have had contact with the bat.",2023-06-01T00:00:00Z,2023,2,26

SALT LAKE CITY — The Mexican Consulate in Salt Lake City is teaming up with nonprofit Alliance Community Services to expand its Ventanilla de Salud program.
The program aims to improve the local Latino community's physical and mental health by offering primary and preventive services in Spanish with cultural relevance.
Marcos Munoz, of Alliance Community Services, said the hope is that the Ventanilla de Salud, which translates directly to ""health window"" in English, becomes a center for the community to receive basic care, as well as a link between the Hispanic community and Utah's health care network.
""We've found that the Hispanic community has a cultural barrier as much as a linguistic barrier,"" Munoz said in Spanish. ""We want to break this cultural barrier that our community has, so that they feel more trustful.""
The services offered — which range from glucose and blood pressure tests to vaccines and cancer support groups — are free and an appointment isn't needed. Although the Ventanilla de Salud isn't appropriate for emergency needs, workers are able to help provide referrals, health care counseling and additional information. Eventually, the Ventanilla de Salud will also offer its services during mobile consulate visits in other parts of the state.
""Everyone is welcome at the Ventanilla de Salud,"" Deputy Consul Patricia Cortes said. ""They don't need an appointment to visit us. They don't even have to be Mexican to visit us. The doors are open, and they can just drop in to see what services we're able to provide.""
Cortes said Alliance Community Services' two decades of experience working in the community, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, was partly why the consulate chose to partner with the nonprofit. The group also has a diverse team that represents the different cultures within the local Latino community, and all staff members speak Spanish and have a unique sensitivity to the situations impacting the community.
""We're very happy to have them on board. They've been engaging with the community already for a while, so they have the necessary experience with regards to approaching the community and getting to know them in different areas,"" Cortes said.
The Ventanilla de Salud is open to the public at the offices of the Consulate of Mexico, at 660 S. 200 East, Suite 300, in Salt Lake City, Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. The ventanilla can be contacted directly by calling 801-833-1934.",2023-03-28T00:00:00Z,2023,1,26

WEST WENDOVER, Nev. — An effort by Planned Parenthood to open a health clinic in the border city of West Wendover is running up against local politics, as city officials declined to grant a necessary permit based on opposition to abortion.
The proposed clinic would have been the closest out-of-state abortion provider to Salt Lake City, and in a city that is already a weekend destination for Utahns thanks to Nevada's liquor and gambling laws.
West Wendover Mayor Jasie Holm said the rural city, with a population just shy of 4,500 in 2021, is in dire need of basic health care, with many residents regularly making the nearly two-hour drive to Salt Lake City for routine appointments.
Planned Parenthood Mar Monte — which serves patients throughout central California and northern Nevada — proposed to help fill the gap by opening a full primary care clinic on one of the city's main thoroughfares. Although Planned Parenthood is known nationally for providing abortion care, Planned Parenthood Mar Monte representatives said the regional organization specializes in rural medicine and would provide a broad range of care to residents in West Wendover.
And while abortion makes up less than 5% of care provided by Planned Parenthood Mar Monte, West Wendover city council members denied the organization's request for a conditional use permit, primarily citing opposition to the practice.
Health care in West Wendover
During a tense city council meeting on Tuesday, citizens on both sides of the issue urged city leaders to either approve or deny Planned Parenthood's request.
Abortion is legal in Nevada up to 24 weeks of pregnancy, but only licensed physicians can provide the procedure, according to the Guttmacher Institute. So while citizens took strong stances as to the morality of abortions, the decision before the council was only to approve or deny a clinic that would offer services that are legal in the state.
Holm said she has been working for years to secure more health care options for residents, and the proposed Planned Parenthood clinic could fill several gaps in care. The city currently has a community health center that provides a limited scope of care several days each month.
""Health care has been the No. 1 complaint about living in West Wendover for years,"" Holm said in a Facebook post. ""Prenatal care, for instance, usually involves 10-15 visits to the (doctor) during pregnancy.""
She said a clinic in West Wendover would mean ""10 less trips to SLC, 10 less days off work, 10 less time paying for gas and maintenance on your vehicle, 10 less times worrying about road conditions. This could greatly improve the quality of life for this pregnant woman.""
Holm told KSL.com that the city's needs include services like kidney dialysis, physical therapy, cardiology, prenatal care, down to setting and casting bones or doing stitches. She said West Wendover has a local clinic that provides family primary care, but lacks urgent care and all the services listed above.
Planned Parenthood Mar Monte's services extend well beyond just reproductive care and would include annual preventive visits, immunizations, screenings for cancer and disease risk, episodic illness care, management of chronic medical conditions, gender-affirming care and education about healthy lifestyle choices.
Stacy Cross, CEO and president at Planned Parenthood Mar Monte, said the organization is ""unique"" because they have several clinics that can provide full primary care.
Cross spoke with KSL.com prior to the council's vote on the clinic.
""When we looked at that site — it's a site that really needs primary care. They have a critical shortage of primary care providers, so we're looking forward to providing an entire range of health services, including reproductive and sexual health care,"" she said.
Cross said the clinic could have been completed within six months of being approved.
West Wendover's city manager told the council the clinic would have no negative impact on accessibility, utilities or other city functions, but the proposal was voted down by the council 4-1.
Holm vetoed the council's vote but admitted that the result would be the same because Planned Parenthood needed an affirmative vote to get the permit.
""We have explored dialysis centers, physical therapy centers, urgent care facilities with funding always being the biggest factor,"" Holm said. ""With the conditional use permit being denied, it's unclear what the next step is for them, if any, in West Wendover.""
Planned Parenthood Mar Monte did not respond to a further request for comment about future plans.
Abortion in Utah
If the clinic was approved, it would have been the nearest out-of-state clinic to Salt Lake City. It would have provided elective abortions to anyone seeking the procedure in Utah.
Durango and Glenwood Springs, Colorado, have Planned Parenthood clinics, but each is more than 350 miles from Salt Lake City.
Grand Junction, Colorado — located just over 30 miles from the Utah border — has a so-called ""crisis pregnancy center,"" operated by Care Net, an evangelical Christian network. Although the center's website provides some abortion information, crisis pregnancy centers are often run by anti-abortion activists and don't perform or recommend abortion care.
Utah's legislature has eroded abortion access in the state in recent years, and the state's restrictive ""trigger ban"" is temporarily paused while the courts consider its legality. That law would prohibit all abortions except in cases of rape or incest, the fetus has a fatal abnormality, or the woman's life is in danger.
Currently, abortions in Utah are legal through 18 weeks of pregnancy, pending a court decision on the trigger ban.
While the primary purpose of the proposed West Wendover clinic would be to provide services to local residents, Cross acknowledged it would have served patients from other states who seek legal abortions there.
""We see patients, currently, from almost all 50 states, and since the abortion bans, over one-third of our patients are forced to travel from their home state to California and Nevada,"" she said. ""It's an incredibly challenging time across our country that people are forced to leave their home state to get basic health care.""",2023-03-08T00:00:00Z,2023,1,26

MELBOURNE, Australia — Novak Djokovic propped up his left shoe on a courtside sign so he could stretch out a hamstring that he acknowledged afterward concerns him. He grimaced while flexing the muscle after one point, hopped on his right leg to keep weight off the left after another. He took a medical timeout while a trainer re-taped him during the second set — which Djokovic would go on to drop.
As if he needed another distraction, Djokovic was flustered enough by a heckler that he asked chair umpire Fergus Murphy to have the spectator removed from Rod Laver Arena, telling the official: ""The guy's drunk out of his mind. ... He's been provoking. He just wants to get in my head.""
As Djokovic summed up afterward: ""It was a lot happening tonight.""
Here's what did not happen Thursday evening at the Australian Open: Djokovic did not lose his way entirely and, most importantly, he did not lose in the second round, which is what happened to both No. 1 seed Rafael Nadal and No. 2 seed Casper Ruud.
Seeking a 10th trophy at Melbourne Park, to add to his own record, and a 22nd Grand Slam title overall, to equal Nadal's, Djokovic put everything aside and beat 191st-ranked French qualifier Enzo Couacaud 6-1, 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-0. It was Djokovic's 23rd consecutive win at the Australian Open, a streak that paused a year ago when he couldn't play in the tournament because he was not vaccinated against COVID-19.
""I am worried. I mean, I cannot say that I'm not. I have reason to be worried,"" Djokovic said about the hamstring, noting that he needs to avoid practicing on days before matches.
""There's not much more to talk about,"" Djokovic said. ""There's two choices: Leave it or keep going. So I'm going to keep going.""
A group of people dressed in red-and-white striped shirts straight out of ""Where's Waldo?"" left the arena after Djokovic pleaded his case with Murphy about one of them giving him a particularly hard time.
""What I have a problem with is when somebody's crossing the line, numerous times ... and saying things that were not respectful at all,"" Djokovic explained at his news conference, adding that it had been going on for more than 1 1/2 hours. ""I had enough, you know?""
This did not shape up as a contest of much intrigue, given that the fourth-seeded Djokovic has done all that he has done, while Couacaud entered with a career mark of 2-5. And whatever Couacaud's chances were beforehand seemed to dim just four games in, when he turned his right ankle and required a visit from a trainer.
But Couacaud overcame that and played freely, conjuring some terrific shotmaking.
""You just have to deal with it. One of those circumstances and situations where things are maybe not going perfectly your way,"" Djokovic said. ""But that's sport.""
He was speaking about how his foe was playing, yet the sentiment captured the night well.
There was a bit of Djokovic's usual interplay with the crowd when he got his game in order. After breaking to lead 2-0 in the last set, he jogged around his side of the court, as if to show his opponent, and everyone else, just how well he was feeling and just how well he was playing.
At another moment, he basked in roars of approval by pointing his index finger to his right ear, asking for more.
Couacaud managed to have some fun, too, when he briefly made things a bit interesting, celebrating his claim of the second set by pointing to the court as if to indicate, ""This is my house!""
Which, of course, it is not. The place belongs to Djokovic, who will play No. 27 Grigor Dimitrov next, and knows that two highly ranked contenders are no longer possible obstacles.

STOCKHOLM — Two scientists won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for discoveries that enabled the creation of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 and that could be used to develop other shots in the future.
Hungarian-American Katalin Karikó and American Drew Weissman were cited for contributing ""to the unprecedented rate of vaccine development during one of the greatest threats to human health in modern times,"" according to the panel that awarded the prize in Stockholm.
The panel said the pair's ""groundbreaking findings ... fundamentally changed our understanding of how mRNA interacts with our immune system.""
Traditionally, making vaccines required growing viruses or pieces of viruses and then purifying them before next steps in brewing shots. The messenger RNA approach starts with a snippet of genetic code that carries instructions for making proteins. Pick the right virus protein to target, and the body turns into a mini vaccine factory.
But simply injecting lab-grown mRNA into the body triggered a reaction that usually destroyed it. Karikó, a professor at Szeged University in Hungary and an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and Weissman, of the University of Pennsylvania, figured out a tiny modification to the building blocks of RNA that made it stealthy enough to slip past those immune defenses.
Karikó, 68, is the 13th woman to win the Nobel Prize in medicine. She was a senior vice president at BioNTech, which partnered with Pfizer to make one of the COVID-19 vaccines. She and Weissman, 64, who is a professor and director of the Penn Institute for RNA Innovations, met by chance in the 1990s while photocopying research papers, according to Penn Today, the university's news website.
Dr. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at Britain's University of East Anglia, described the mRNA vaccines as a ""game changer"" in helping to shut down the coronavirus pandemic, crediting the shots with saving millions of lives.
""If it hadn't been for the mRNA technology, COVID would have been much worse,"" he said. ""Vaccines generally were the turning point in slowing down COVID and the mRNA vaccines were just so much better than all the others,"" he said, noting that the main vaccine used in the U.K., made by AstraZeneca, is barely in use anymore.
""We would likely only now be coming out of the depths of COVID without the mRNA vaccines,"" Hunter said.
We would likely only now be coming out of the depths of COVID without the mRNA vaccines.
–Dr. Paul Hunter, University of East Anglia
Dr. Bharat Pankhania, an infectious diseases expert at Exeter University, said that a major advantage of mRNA technology was that vaccines could be made in extremely large quantities since their main components are made in laboratories.
Pankhania predicted that the technology used in the vaccines could be used to refine vaccines for other diseases like Ebola, malaria and dengue, and might also be used to create shots that immunize people against certain types of cancer or auto-immune diseases like lupus.
""It's possible that we could vaccinate people against abnormal cancer proteins and have the immune system attack it after being given a targeted mRNA shot,"" he explained. ""It's a much more targeted technology than has been previously available and could revolutionize how we handle not only outbreaks, but non-communicable diseases.""
Nobel Committee member Gunilla Karlsson Hedestam said the prize could go some way to addressing concerns among skeptics about the speed with which COVID-19 vaccines were developed.
She said the award highlights ""the decades of basic research that's behind this kind of work.""
""The future is just so incredible,"" Weissman said. ""We've been thinking for years about everything that we could do with RNA, and now it's here.""
Karikó said her husband was the first to pick up the early morning call, handing it to her to hear the news. ""I couldn't believe it,"" she said. ""I was very much surprised. But I am very happy.""
Before COVID-19, mRNA vaccines were already being tested for other diseases like Zika, influenza and rabies — but the pandemic brought more attention to this approach, Karikó said.
""There was already clinical trials before COVID, but people were not aware,"" she said.
Karikó's family are no strangers to high honors. Her daughter, Susan Francia, is a double Olympic gold medalist in rowing, competing for the United States.
The prize carries a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million) — from a bequest left by the prize's creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. The laureates are invited to receive their awards at ceremonies on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.
Nobel announcements continue with the physics prize on Tuesday, chemistry on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the economics award on Oct. 9.

SALT LAKE CITY — The second episode of HBO series ""The Last of Us"" aired Sunday, drawing 5.7 million viewers, Variety reported. That's a million more people than the premiere, marking the largest audience growth in a single week that the streaming platform has ever seen.
Despite the series' popularity, parents wondering if it's appropriate for children should be aware of its TV-MA rating for scenes of intense violence and profanity.
The show's growth in viewership may have those who haven't seen it asking, what's the big whoop?
Video game origin
Part of ""the big whoop"" may be the action-adventure video game off of which the show is based. Sony Interactive Entertainment published the game ""The Last of Us"" in 2013. A second part was released in 2020, driving a resurgence in popularity.
Gamers who played ""The Last of Us"" have taken to Twitter to explain what it's like to watch an adaptation of a story they've known and loved for years.
In a BBC review of the show, culture writer Stephen Kelly calls the show ""the best video game adaptation ever made,"" saying it pays tribute to the original game but is still ""capable of surprise.""
Not your average post-apocalypse
Other viewers point to the fact that the series goes beyond typical tropes featured in post-apocalyptic TV shows.
""There's actually a deep storyline,"" said Clara Ohran, a Provo resident and fan of the show. ""It's not just like, 'Survive, kill all the zombies.'""
The storyline occurs 20 years after a fungal infection wipes out civilization. Seasoned smuggler Joel Miller attempts to transport Ellie, a teenage girl who might be key to a cure, across what's left of the United States, fighting government soldiers and ""the infected"" along the way.
But the show is not limited to action and adventure; it also features the emotional formation of a father-daughter bond between Joel and Ellie.
Ohran also noted that Ellie is revealed to be a lesbian in the second version of the video game, which may have LGBTQ fans excited for some representation.
The opinion that the series is unique to others of its genre is not, however, universal. In a Time review, entertainment writer Judy Berman praised the show for its writing, acting and visuals, but said it ultimately leaves much to be desired.
""It's not that the characters' motivations are muddled, or that the central dilemma of self vs. society isn't explored in enough depth,"" her review reads. ""But that moral conflict, which resonated with so many fans of the game, isn't exactly novel in this medium.""
Parallels to real life
Although ""The Last of Us"" is fictional, certain elements of the show are based in reality.
For example, the fungus responsible for the global pandemic is based on a real fungus called ""cordyceps,"" which generally infects ants.
The fictional pandemic may also remind viewers of the COVID-19 pandemic — minus the zombies — as Ohran points out.
""Everything is super strict, no one wants to go outside because they don't want to get sick, but then people are also very hesitant to get a vaccine or even talk about a vaccine,"" she said.
Kimball suggested that maybe the show isn't so far from reality.
""They very much are making a commentary on how our society operates and how it would be different if something catastrophic like that were to happen,"" she said.
To see what a post-apocalyptic America might look like, episode three of ""The Last of Us"" on HBO or HBO Max aired on Monday.",2023-01-24T00:00:00Z,2023,1,26

WASHINGTON — For weeks, scientists have been watching a slew of omicron descendants duke it out for dominance of COVID-19 transmission in the United States, with the BQs — BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 — seeming to edge out all the others to claim a slight lead.
The result has been a gradual rise in cases and hospitalizations that never seemed to reach the peaks of this summer's BA.5 wave and was certainly nothing like the tsunami of illness caused by the original omicron strain a year ago.
But on Friday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's COVID-19 variant dashboard revealed a new dark horse that could soon sweep the field: XBB.1.5.
The CDC estimates that XBB.1.5 has more than doubled its share of the COVID-19 pie each week for the last four, rising from about 4% to 41% of new infections over the month of December. In the Northeast, the CDC estimates, XBB.1.5 is causing 75% of new cases.
""For a few months now, we haven't seen a variant that's taken off at that speed,"" said Pavitra Roychoudhury, director of COVID-19 sequencing at the University of Washington School of Medicine's virology lab.
Virologists and epidemiologists say this omicron sublineage has features that give it the potential to drive a new surge of COVID-19 cases in the U.S., although it's still unclear how large that wave will be and whether it could send many more people to the hospital.
For all the recent concern that a new COVID-19 threat could come from China's ongoing surge, experts point out that XBB.1.5 appears to have arisen in the United States. It was first detected in New York and Connecticut in late October, according to GISAID, a global effort to catalog and track variants of the coronavirus.
Trevor Bedford, a professor of computational biology at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, said XBB.1.5 has a growth rate similar to that of its distant cousin BA.5.
Bedford has pegged its effective reproductive number — the number of new infections expected to be caused by each infected person — at about 1.6, roughly 40% higher than its next closest competitor.
""I expect it to drive increased circulation in the coming weeks,"" Bedford wrote in an email. That increase may not be reflected in case numbers, he pointed out, since more people are testing at home, and their cases may not be counted unless they seek medical care and get a lab test to confirm their results. ""So I'd look to hospitalizations in the vulnerable age groups (such as seniors) as better indicator of wave,"" he wrote.
Slippery subvariants
XBB.1.5 is the product of recombination: Two descendants of BA.2, the subvariant that drove a modest wave of cases in the U.S. in April, swapped pieces of their genetic code, resulting in 14 new mutations to the virus' spike proteins compared with BA.2, and a new sublineage, XBB.
XBB drove a wave of cases in Singapore this fall but never gained much ground in the U.S. Here, it had to compete against a slew of co-circulating variants that had each independently evolved some of the same mutations, making them more equally matched.
Still, scientists have been keeping a close eye on XBB and its spinoffs.
Dr. David Ho, professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University, recently tested viruses engineered to have the spikes of XBB and XBB.1 as well as BQ.1 and BQ 1.1 in his lab against antibodies from the blood of people who'd been infected, who were vaccinated with the original and new bivalent vaccines, and who'd been both infected and vaccinated. His team also tested 23 monoclonal antibody treatments against these new sublineages.
He found that XBB.1 was the slipperiest of them all. It was 63 times less likely to be neutralized by antibodies in the blood of infected and vaccinated people than BA.2 and 49 times less likely to be neutralized compared with BA.4 and BA.5.
In terms of immune evasion, Ho says, these variants have shifted as far away from the antibodies we have made to use against them as the original omicron variant was from the COVID-19 viruses that preceded it roughly a year ago.
He calls these levels of immune evasion ""alarming"" and said they could further compromise the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines. His findings were recently published in the journal Cell.
Ho said Monday that XBB.1.5 was the same story in terms of antibody evasion as XBB.1, which means it has the potential to escape the protections of vaccinations and past infections. It's also resistant to all current antibody treatments, including Evusheld.
Another trick up its sleeve
In addition to being highly immune evasive, XBB.1.5 has an additional trick up its sleeve that seems to be helping to fuel its growth. It has a key mutation at site 486, which allows it to bind more tightly to ACE2, the doors the virus uses to enter our cells.
""The mutation is clearly letting XBB.1.5 spread better,"" Jesse Bloom, a computational virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, wrote in an email.
This mutation was first flagged by Bloom, who studies the evolution of viruses and viral proteins, as one that could be important for viral fitness. It has been confirmed by Yunlong Cao at Peking University.
""It's got a better ability to get into cells,"" Roychoudhury said, which means it's more infectious.
Still, experts say it's hard to know how much of XBB.1.5's growth can be attributed to properties of the virus and how much simply to good timing.
Coming out of the holidays, during which time people were more likely to travel and socialize, gives any infection — whether it's the flu, COVID-19 or RSV — more room to run.
""Most public health officials would have expected an increase in COVID-19 cases, even before we knew about XBB.1.5.,"" said Andrew Pekosz, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who studies viral replication.
""So whether the increases in COVID cases that are occurring during the holidays are occurring because of the social interactions that people have had or whether they're specifically related to XBB.1.5 is still something that isn't clear. Both of those things are probably contributing,"" Pekosz said.
Most experts said that while they expect that XBB.1.5 has the potential to cause more illness, they don't expect those infections to necessarily be more severe.
'More immunity in the population'
Looking at the Northeast, where XBB.1.5 is thought to be causing the majority of infections, Michael Osterholm, who directs the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, sees reason for hope.
Osterholm notes that the updated boosters should provide some protection, even against this highly immune evasive strain.
""They still provide a level of immunity that may not prevent you from getting infected but may have a significant impact on whether or not you become seriously ill and die,"" he said. ""I mean, right now, the most recent data we have shows that for those who have the bivalent vaccine, they have a three-fold lower risk of dying than those who don't.""
Americans have been slow to get the new boosters, however. According to CDC data, only 15% of Americans who are eligible have had an updated booster. Among seniors — those age 65 and older — only about 1 in 3 have had an updated shot.
Experts also note that although antibody treatments won't work against this sublineage, other antivirals, such as Paxlovid and remdesivir, should still be effective.
Rapid tests continue to work, as do masks, and ventilation and filtration of indoor air, so even as the virus continues to evolve, there are still good ways to protect yourself from getting COVID-19.
""It doesn't appear to be causing any more severe illness, and so I think that it's a very different situation circulating today than had it been a year ago,"" Osterholm said. ""There's so much more immunity in the population that I don't think that it's going to take off.""",2023-01-03T00:00:00Z,2023,1,26

SALT LAKE CITY — The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced a global effort on Thursday to improve the health of women and children, spearheaded by the church's women's organization, the Relief Society.
It will use current church networks and external organizations with similar goals to support families by improving access to nutrition, immunizations and maternal and newborn care.
""Whenever we do anything to bring relief to others — temporal or spiritual — we are bringing them to Jesus Christ and will be blessed to find our own relief in him,"" said Relief Society President Camille N. Johnson in a news release.
A page was launched on the church's website dedicated to information about children's nutrition, hygiene and wellness to help people around the world, and how members can get involved and help.
""As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we have a responsibility to care for all of God's children around the world. One of the ways we make the biggest impact is by prioritizing the health and well-being of women and children,"" the page says.
It says the goal of the initiative is to help children reach their potential through food security, immunization, education, care initiatives and refugee responses.
President Johnson in the press release listed another goal: empowering families.
""In many cases, loving parents lack the knowledge to provide adequate nutrition for their children. With greater understanding and resources, they are better equipped to make changes that can have a lasting impact,"" she said.
Currently, the church has programs to screen children for malnutrition and train parents on dietary diversification in 12 countries in Central America, Africa and Asia, and the program will be launched in additional countries soon.
Volunteer members and health experts are teaching about the importance of diet while helping families get immediate treatments, food supplements and medications for deworming, the press release said.
""This project is something that comes naturally to women,"" said Kristin M. Yee, second counselor in the Relief Society general presidency.
She said members of the Relief Society are already nurturing people in homes and communities and whether they are involved in this initiative or not, they are making a difference in others' lives.
Often the best humanitarian outreach is to those closest to us in everyday acts of kindness.
– Relief Society President Camille N. Johnson
The church is working with governments and charitable organizations to identify where need exists and whether those needs are served best by immediate food assistance or self-reliance projects.
President Johnson said this humanitarian initiative is an ""optional opportunity"" for Relief Society members who are already involved in helping their local congregations.
""Often the best humanitarian outreach is to those closest to us in everyday acts of kindness. When we serve our families and our neighbors, we are part of a global cause,"" she said.
The church has previously donated millions of dollars toward addressing global malnutrition. In August, it announced a $44 million donation to help mothers in 30 countries feed their families.",2023-11-09T00:00:00Z,2023,4,26

SALT LAKE CITY — The Utah lawmaker behind the state's new age-verification requirement to access pornography online said there have been discussions with a private company about doing the checks at no cost to taxpayers.
""We would just be saying to people, 'If you want to look at this adult content, then here's a vendor who will verify your age for you.' It's not a mandatory thing,"" state Sen. Todd Weiler, R-Woods Cross, told the Deseret News.
The 2023 Legislature unanimously passed his bill mandating that pornography websites verify users in Utah are at least 18 years old. After it took effect this month, one of the world's largest online pornography sites, Pornhub, blocked Utah users and sued the state,
""Nobody in the Utah government that I've talked to is terribly concerned that PornHub has decided to turn off the spigot for Utah,"" Weiler said, adding he doesn't expect offering age verification will impact the lawsuit.
According to the state senator, PornHub ""saw their clicks go down by 80% In Louisiana"" after complying with that state's first-in-the-nation age verification requirement and decided, ""well, we're not going to make that mistake again.""
Hiring Envoc, a Louisiana-based company that created a ""digital wallet"" used for the age verification, could be a free trial run for what's ahead for social media users next year in Utah, Weiler said.
He said he wants to try out an age verification system on the ""small fraction"" of Utahns affected by his bill, rather than waiting until almost everyone will have to prove they're at least 18 years old or have parental permission to be on social media.
No further legislation is expected to be needed, the state senator said, even though the company would need access to the Utah driver's license database. He said the new age verification system could be up and running within two months.
What digital age verification could look like
Calvin Fabre, Envoc's president and founder, said Louisiana offers what he called a ""citizen's wallet"" that includes hunting and fishing licenses, medical licenses, insurance cards and other items in addition to driver's licenses.
For Utah, Fabre said, the company's app would only be used initially to determine whether someone is at least 18 years old or should be blocked because they are younger, without logging personal information or the website being accessed.
He said the 10 cents per ""age challenge"" that Envoc is currently paid by the compliance companies used by online adult content providers is an introductory rate and could change.
To set up the free app, Utahns would have to provide information including their names, address, date of birth and driver's license or state ID number, as well as likely a photo for facial matching with what's on file with the Utah Division of Motor Vehicles, Fabre said.
When an online pornography site detects customers are from Utah, he said the users would be told to open their app and enter a one-time code. Then, they'd be asked to permit access only to their ""coarse age"" — whether they are 18 and older — for verification.
Age verification for such sites should just be a start for Utahns, Fabre said.
""There's so many other use cases. Here in Louisiana, we use it for ordering and delivering alcohol remotely, we use it for unemployment benefits, we use it for appearing in court over Zoom,"" to verify identities, he said, adding the same is done for food stamp recipients.
Revenue from Louisiana's digital wallet ""comes from a combination of renewals, duplicates, commercial verifications from businesses and special request projects such as the COVID-19 vaccination 'Smart card' we added during COVID,"" he said.
Fabre said 1.7 million Louisiana residents have ""digital wallets,"" about 65% of those eligible. He said there is no charge unless they renew their wallet, which expires at the same time as a driver's license, or order a duplicate.
The 'knee-jerk reaction' to pornography legislation
Weiler brought up that the state is talking with the company behind Louisiana's age verification system in a wide-ranging New York magazine interview about pornography posted Monday that included his views on sex education and gun control.
He said as an elected official he tries to accommodate all media requests, noting he recently talked with a reporter for a publication in Israel. And, Weiler said, he wants to get the word out about what Utah is doing.
""This crusade to protect children from pornography, it's bigger than Utah and I think Utah has been leading out on this issue, as has Louisiana now. I'm hoping that legislators in other states are paying attention to what we're doing,"" he said.
But Weiler said he feels some interviews, including New York magazine's, ""want to put me in a box. They want to say, 'Oh, here's a Mormon from Utah trying to impose their religion on everybody and they're using the force of government.""
He called that a ""knee-jerk reaction,"" noting that legislation he sponsored in 2016 labeling pornography as a public health crisis drew that type of criticism but 16 other states passed similar declarations in the following three years.
Because legislating pornography is relatively new, ""everybody wants to go to the religion card first. I'm just trying to dispel that notion, saying, 'Yes my religion is against pornography, but that's not what we're talking about here,'"" he said.
""We already have laws saying that this filthy content is not acceptable for children. Every state has that law on the books, but nobody is enforcing it. So when I try to put some teeth to that issue, I always get this pushback that it's just religion. I think it's bigger than that.""",2023-05-24T00:00:00Z,2023,2,26

SALT LAKE CITY — More babies are hospitalized for respiratory syncytial virus than any other cause. And now that an RSV vaccine has been approved, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is urging pregnant women to make sure they take advantage of it, for the sake of the child.
RSV can be especially severe in infants.
Pfizer's vaccine, sold as Abrysvo, reduces the risk of hospitalization for babies by 57% in the first six months after birth, according to the CDC. The recommendation is that pregnant women get the injection between week 32 and week 36 of their pregnancy.
This is the first fall/winter — the typical start of RSV season — when vaccines are available for RSV.
CDC reports that most children will have RSV before they turn 2. Symptoms of the respiratory virus include runny nose, loss of appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever and wheezing. The only symptoms in very young children could be irritability, a decrease in activity and congestion.
For both very young children and older adults, though, RSV can become dangerous. In babies, it can cause severe infections, including lung inflammation and pneumonia. Each year, up to 300 children under age 5 die of complications from RSV, while many more are hospitalized. Among adults older than 60, as many as 160,000 are hospitalized each year.
Reducing risk
""The vaccine is one of two new tools we have this season to protect babies from severe RSV illness,"" the CDC announcement said. ""Last month, CDC recommended a new RSV immunization for infants that has been shown to reduce the risk of both RSV-related hospitalizations and health care visits in infants by about 80%.""
The Deseret News quoted Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, about the approval of the vaccine in August. ""RSV is a common cause of illness in children and infants are among those at highest risk for severe disease, which can lead to hospitalization,"" he said. ""This approval provides an option for health care providers and pregnant individuals to protect infants from this potentially life-threatening disease.""
In pregnancy
In most cases, only one vaccine is needed each year, but getting it during pregnancy is believed to protect both the mother and her child from RSV during the first months of the baby's life. Because it takes some time for immunity to develop after a vaccine, a doctor might recommend the postnatal vaccine if the baby was born soon after the shot was administered to the pregnant woman.
For pregnant women, the most common side effects from receiving an Abrysvo injection are pain where the shot is given including muscle pain, as well as headache and nausea.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is also requiring Pfizer to continue studying the side effects related to use among pregnant women.
CDC also recommends both the updated COVID-19 and influenza vaccines for anyone 6 months or older.",2023-09-26T00:00:00Z,2023,3,26

WASHINGTON — The federal government will relaunch a program to provide free COVID-19 home tests to Americans, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday.
""We will once again begin our program to provide Americans with an opportunity to request tests,"" HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said during an event at a Washington CVS Pharmacy where he was vaccinated against COVID-19 and flu.
Households can order four free tests from Covidtests.gov starting Sept. 25.
The U.S. government has shipped more than 755 million free COVID-19 tests to people who requested them through Covidtests.gov. The program was suspended in May, after the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency, to preserve supply.
Becerra said HHS's Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response ""has been resupplying our stockpile.""
The tests coming available soon are intended for use through the end of 2023 and will include instructions on how to verify extended expiration dates, HHS said in an announcement Wednesday. The expiration dates of many home COVID-19 tests have been extended well beyond what's printed on the package.
HHS and ASPR also announced $600 million for 12 U.S. COVID-19 test manufacturers to strengthen manufacturing capacity and purchase about 200 million over-the-counter COVID-19 tests for use by the federal government. The funding will go to manufacturers in New Jersey, California, Texas, Washington, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Delaware.
""The Biden-Harris Administration, in partnership with domestic manufacturers, has made great strides in addressing vulnerabilities in the U.S. supply chain by reducing our reliance on overseas manufacturing,"" Becerra said in a statement. ""These critical investments will strengthen our nation's production levels of domestic at-home COVID-19 rapid tests and help mitigate the spread of the virus.""
COVID-19 hospitalizations have been on the rise in the United States since July, with weekly admissions now more than triple what they were two months ago. More than 20,500 people in the U.S. were admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 during the week ending September 9, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — about 8% higher than the week before.
